34862481	The risk of zoonotic coronavirus spillover into the human population, as highlighted by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, demands the development of pan-coronavirus antivirals. The efficacy of existing antiviral ribonucleoside/ribonucleotide analogs, such as remdesivir, is decreased by the viral proofreading exonuclease NSP14-NSP10 complex. Here, using a novel assay and in silico modeling and screening, we identified NSP14-NSP10 inhibitors that increase remdesivir's potency. A model compound, sofalcone, both inhibits the exonuclease activity of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV in vitro, and synergistically enhances the antiviral effect of remdesivir, suppressing the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and the related human coronavirus OC43. The validation of top hits from our primary screenings using cellular systems provides proof-of-concept for the NSP14 complex as a therapeutic target.

34433059	"The human brain consists of specialized areas that flexibly interact to form a multitude of functional networks. Complementary to this notion of modular organization, brain function has been shown to vary along a smooth continuum across the whole cortex. We demonstrate a mathematical framework that accounts for both of these perspectives: harmonic modes. We calculate the harmonic modes of the brain's functional connectivity graph, called ""functional harmonics,"" revealing a multi-dimensional, frequency-ordered set of basis functions. Functional harmonics link characteristics of cortical organization across several spatial scales, capturing aspects of intra-areal organizational features (retinotopy, somatotopy), delineating brain areas, and explaining macroscopic functional networks as well as global cortical gradients. Furthermore, we show how the activity patterns elicited by seven different tasks are reconstructed from a very small subset of functional harmonics. Our results suggest that the principle of harmonicity, ubiquitous in nature, also underlies functional cortical organization in the human brain."

34433024	"Neuronal oscillations are suggested to play an important role in auditory working memory (WM), but their contribution to content-specific representations has remained unclear. Here, we measure magnetoencephalography during a retro-cueing task with parametric ripple-sound stimuli, which are spectrotemporally similar to speech but resist non-auditory memory strategies. Using machine learning analyses, with rigorous between-subject cross-validation and non-parametric permutation testing, we show that memorized sound content is strongly represented in phase-synchronization patterns between subregions of auditory and frontoparietal cortices. These phase-synchronization patterns predict the memorized sound content steadily across the studied maintenance period. In addition to connectivity-based representations, there are indices of more local, ""activity silent"" representations in auditory cortices, where the decoding accuracy of WM content significantly increases after task-irrelevant ""impulse stimuli."" Our results demonstrate that synchronization patterns across auditory sensory and association areas orchestrate neuronal coding of auditory WM content. This connectivity-based coding scheme could also extend beyond the auditory domain."	Synchronization patterns reveal neuronal coding of working memory content.	Cell reports	0.0	0
34788626	Young adult cancer has increased in incidence worldwide, but its molecular etiologies remain unclear. We systematically characterize genomic profiles of young adult tumors with ages of onset </=50 years and compare them to later-onset tumors using over 6,000 cases across 14 cancer types. While young adult tumors generally show lower mutation burdens and comparable copy-number variation rates compared to later-onset cases, they are enriched for multiple driver mutations and copy-number alterations in subtype-specific contexts. Characterization of tumor immune microenvironments reveals pan-cancer patterns of elevated TGF-beta response/dendritic cells and lower IFN-gamma response/macrophages relative to later-onset tumors, corresponding to age-related responses to immunotherapy in several cancer types. Finally, we identify prevalent clinically actionable events that disproportionally affect young adult or later-onset cases. The resulting catalog of age-related molecular drivers can guide precision diagnostics and treatments for young adult cancer.

34688661	Nonalcohol-associated fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excessive hepatic accumulation of fat that can progress to steatohepatitis, and currently, therapeutic options are limited. Using a high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model of NAFLD, we determined the effects of the synthetic retinoid, AC261066, a selective retinoic acid receptor beta2 (RARbeta2) agonist, on the global liver transcriptomes and metabolomes of mice with dietary-induced obesity (DIO) using genome-wide RNA-seq and untargeted metabolomics. We found that AC261066 limits mRNA increases in several presumptive NAFLD driver genes, including Pklr, Fasn, Thrsp, and Chchd6. Importantly, AC261066 limits the increases in the transcript and protein levels of KHK, a key enzyme for fructose metabolism, and causes multiple changes in liver metabolites involved in fructose metabolism. In addition, in cultured murine hepatocytes, where exposure to fructose and palmitate results in a profound increase in lipid accumulation, AC261066 limits this lipid accumulation. Importantly, we demonstrate that in a human hepatocyte cell line, RARbeta is required for the inhibitory effects of AC261066 on palmitate-induced lipid accumulation. Finally, our data indicate that AC261066 inhibits molecular events underpinning fibrosis and exhibits anti-inflammatory effects. In conclusion, changes in the transcriptome and metabolome indicate that AC261066 affects molecular changes underlying multiple aspects of NAFLD, including steatosis and fibrosis. Therefore, we suggest that AC261066 may have potential as an effective therapy for NAFLD.

34698433	Angiopoietins 1 and 2 (Ang1 and Ang2) regulate angiogenesis through their similar F-domains by activating Tie2 receptors on endothelial cells. Despite the similarity in the underlying receptor-binding interaction, the two angiopoietins have opposite effects: Ang1 induces phosphorylation of AKT, strengthens cell-cell junctions, and enhances endothelial cell survival while Ang2 can antagonize these effects, depending on cellular context. To investigate the molecular basis for the opposing effects, we examined the phenotypes of a series of computationally designed protein scaffolds presenting the Ang1 F-domain in a wide range of valencies and geometries. We find two broad phenotypic classes distinguished by the number of presented F-domains: Scaffolds presenting 3 or 4 F-domains have Ang2-like activity, upregulating pFAK and pERK but not pAKT, while scaffolds presenting 6, 8, 12, 30, or 60 F-domains have Ang1-like activity, upregulating pAKT and inducing migration and vascular stability. The scaffolds with 6 or more F-domains display super-agonist activity, producing stronger phenotypes at lower concentrations than Ang1. Tie2 super-agonist nanoparticles reduced blood extravasation and improved blood-brain barrier integrity four days after a controlled cortical impact injury.

34731615	"Behaviorally relevant sounds are often composed of distinct acoustic units organized into specific temporal sequences. The meaning of such sound sequences can therefore be fully recognized only when they have terminated. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the perception of sound sequences remain unclear. Here, we use two-photon calcium imaging in the auditory cortex of behaving mice to test the hypothesis that neural responses to termination of sound sequences (""Off-responses"") encode their acoustic history and behavioral salience. We find that auditory cortical Off-responses encode preceding sound sequences and that learning to associate a sound sequence with a reward induces enhancement of Off-responses relative to responses during the sound sequence (""On-responses""). Furthermore, learning enhances network-level discriminability of sound sequences by Off-responses. Last, learning-induced plasticity of Off-responses but not On-responses lasts to the next day. These findings identify auditory cortical Off-responses as a key neural signature of acquired sound-sequence salience."

34818551	Statins are among the most commonly prescribed drugs, and around every fourth person above the age of 40 is on statin medication. Therefore, it is of utmost clinical importance to understand the effect of statins on cancer cell plasticity and its consequences to not only patients with cancer but also patients who are on statins. Here, we find that statins induce a partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype in cancer cells of solid tumors. Using a comprehensive STRING network analysis of transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome data combined with multiple mechanistic in vitro and functional in vivo analyses, we demonstrate that statins reduce cellular plasticity by enforcing a mesenchymal-like cell state that increases metastatic seeding ability on one side but reduces the formation of (secondary) tumors on the other due to heterogeneous treatment responses. Taken together, we provide a thorough mechanistic overview of the consequences of statin use for each step of cancer development, progression, and metastasis.

34774524	Hemophilia A (HA) is a bleeding disorder caused by deficiency of the coagulation factor VIII (F8). F8 replacement is standard of care, whereas gene therapy (F8 gene) for HA is an attractive investigational approach. However, the large size of the F8 gene and the immunogenicity of the product present challenges in development of the F8 gene therapy. To resolve these problems, we synthesized a shortened F8 gene (F8-BDD) and cloned it into a lentiviral vector (LV). The F8-BDD produced mainly short cleaved inactive products in LV-transduced cells. To improve F8 functionality, we designed two novel F8-BDD genes, one with an insertion of eight specific N-glycosylation sites (F8-N8) and another which restored all N-glycosylation sites (F8-299) in the B domain. Although the overall protein expression was reduced, high coagulation activity (>100-fold) was detected in the supernatants of LV-F8-N8- and LV-F8-299-transduced cells. Protein analysis of F8 and the procoagulation cofactor, von Willebrand Factor, showed enhanced interaction after restoration of B domain glycosylation using F8-299. HA mouse hematopoietic stem cell transplantation studies illustrated that the bleeding phenotype was corrected after LV-F8-N8 or -299 gene transfer into the hematopoietic stem cells. Importantly, the F8-299 modification markedly reduced immunogenicity of the F8 protein in these HA mice. In conclusion, the modified F8-299 gene could be efficiently packaged into LV and, although with reduced expression, produced highly stable and functional F8 protein that corrected the bleeding phenotype without inhibitory immunogenicity. We anticipate that these results will be beneficial in the development of gene therapies against HA.

34088983	Despite the identification of several genetic factors linked to increased susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated in detail. The ubiquitin ligases RNF20 and RNF40 mediate the monoubiquitination of histone H2B at lysine 120 (H2Bub1) and were shown to play context-dependent roles in the development of inflammation. Here, we aimed to examine the function of the RNF20/RNF40/H2Bub1 axis in intestinal inflammation in IBD patients and mouse models. For this purpose, intestinal sections from IBD patients were immunohistochemically stained for H2Bub1. Rnf20 or Rnf40 were conditionally deleted in the mouse intestine and mice were monitored for inflammation-associated symptoms. Using mRNA-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq, we analyzed underlying molecular pathways in primary intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) isolated from these animals and confirmed these findings in IBD resection specimens using ChIP-seq.The majority (80%) of IBD patients displayed a loss of H2Bub1 levels in inflamed areas and the intestine-specific deletion of Rnf20 or Rnf40 resulted in spontaneous colorectal inflammation in mice. Consistently, deletion of Rnf20 or Rnf40 promoted IBD-associated gene expression programs, including deregulation of various IBD risk genes in these animals. Further analysis of murine IECs revealed that H3K4me3 occupancy and transcription of the Vitamin D Receptor (Vdr) gene and VDR target genes is RNF20/40-dependent. Finally, these effects were confirmed in a subgroup of Crohn's disease patients which displayed epigenetic and expression changes in RNF20/40-dependent gene signatures. Our findings reveal that loss of H2B monoubiquitination promotes intestinal inflammation via decreased VDR activity thereby identifying RNF20 and RNF40 as critical regulators of IBD.

34601505	Tumor cells must rewire cellular metabolism to satisfy the demands of unbridled growth and proliferation. How these metabolic processes are integrated to fuel cancer cell growth remains largely unknown. Deciphering the regulatory mechanisms is vital to develop targeted strategies for tumor-selective therapies. We herein performed an unbiased and functional siRNA screen against 96 deubiquitinases, which play indispensable roles in cancer and are emerging as therapeutic targets, and identified USP29 as a top candidate essential for metabolic reprogramming that support biosynthesis and survival in tumor cells. Integrated metabolic flux analysis and molecular investigation reveal that USP29 directly deubiquitinates and stabilizes MYC and HIF1alpha, two master regulators of metabolic reprogramming, enabling adaptive response of tumor cells in both normoxia and hypoxia. Systemic knockout of Usp29 depleted MYC and HIF1alpha in MYC-driven neuroblastoma and B cell lymphoma, inhibited critical metabolic targets and significantly prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice. Strikingly, mice homozygous null for the Usp29 gene are viable, fertile, and display no gross phenotypic abnormalities. Altogether, these results demonstrate that USP29 selectively coordinates MYC and HIF1alpha to integrate metabolic processes critical for cancer cell growth, and therapeutic targeting of USP29, a potentially targetable enzyme, could create a unique vulnerability given deregulation of MYC and HIF1alpha frequently occurs in human cancers.

34798071	The discovery of oxidative cleavage of recalcitrant polysaccharides by lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) has affected the study and industrial application of enzymatic biomass processing. Despite being widespread in fungi, LPMOs belonging to the auxiliary activity (AA) family AA11 have been understudied. While these LPMOs are considered chitin active, some family members have little or no activity toward chitin, and the only available crystal structure of an AA11 LPMO lacks features found in bacterial chitin-active AA10 LPMOs. Here, we report structural and functional characteristics of a single-domain AA11 LPMO from Aspergillus fumigatus, AfAA11A. The crystal structure shows a substrate-binding surface with features resembling those of known chitin-active LPMOs. Indeed, despite the absence of a carbohydrate-binding module, AfAA11A has considerable affinity for alpha-chitin and, more so, beta-chitin. AfAA11A is active toward both these chitin allomorphs and enhances chitin degradation by an endoacting chitinase, in particular for alpha-chitin. The catalytic activity of AfAA11A on chitin increases when supplying reactions with hydrogen peroxide, showing that, like LPMOs from other families, AfAA11A has peroxygenase activity. These results show that, in stark contrast to the previously characterized AfAA11B from the same organism, AfAA11A likely plays a role in fungal chitin turnover. Thus, members of the hitherto rather enigmatic family of AA11 LPMOs show considerable structural and functional differences and may have multiple roles in fungal physiology.

34774797	After transcription termination, cellular RNA polymerases (RNAPs) are occasionally trapped on DNA, impounded in an undefined post-termination complex (PTC), limiting the free RNAP pool and subsequently leading to inefficient transcription. In Escherichia coli, a Swi2/Snf2 family of ATPase called RapA is known to be involved in countering such inefficiency through RNAP recycling; however, the precise mechanism of this recycling is unclear. To better understand its mechanism, here we determined the structures of two sets of E. coli RapA-RNAP complexes, along with the RNAP core enzyme and the elongation complex, using cryo-EM. These structures revealed the large conformational changes of RNAP and RapA upon their association that has been implicated in the hindrance of PTC formation. Our results along with DNA-binding assays reveal that although RapA binds RNAP away from the DNA-binding main channel, its binding can allosterically close the RNAP clamp, thereby preventing its nonspecific DNA binding and PTC formation. Taken together, we propose that RapA acts as a guardian of RNAP by which RapA prevents nonspecific DNA binding of RNAP without affecting the binding of promoter DNA recognition sigma factor, thereby enhancing RNAP recycling.

34686342	The DREAM (dimerization partner [DP], retinoblastoma [Rb]-like, E2F, and MuvB) complex controls cellular quiescence by repressing cell-cycle and other genes, but its mechanism of action is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that two C. elegans THAP domain proteins, LIN-15B and LIN-36, co-localize with DREAM and function by different mechanisms for repression of distinct sets of targets. LIN-36 represses classical cell-cycle targets by promoting DREAM binding and gene body enrichment of H2A.Z, and we find that DREAM subunit EFL-1/E2F is specific for LIN-36 targets. In contrast, LIN-15B represses germline-specific targets in the soma by facilitating H3K9me2 promoter marking. We further find that LIN-36 and LIN-15B differently regulate DREAM binding. In humans, THAP proteins have been implicated in cell-cycle regulation by poorly understood mechanisms. We propose that THAP domain proteins are key mediators of Rb/DREAM function.

34800360	Calcium influx through plasma membrane calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels, which are formed of hexamers of Orai1, is a potent trigger for many important biological processes, most notably in T cell-mediated immunity. Through a bioinformatics-led cell biological screen, we have identified Orai1 as a substrate for the rhomboid intramembrane protease RHBDL2. We show that RHBDL2 prevents stochastic calcium signaling in unstimulated cells through conformational surveillance and cleavage of inappropriately activated Orai1. A conserved disease-linked proline residue is responsible for RHBDL2's recognizing the active conformation of Orai1, which is required to sharpen switch-like signaling triggered by store-operated calcium entry. Loss of RHBDL2 control of CRAC channel activity causes severe dysregulation of downstream CRAC channel effectors, including transcription factor activation, inflammatory cytokine expression, and T cell activation. We propose that this surveillance function may represent an ancient activity of rhomboid proteases in degrading unwanted signaling proteins.

34637754	The heterogeneous family of complexes comprising Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) is instrumental for establishing facultative heterochromatin that is repressive to transcription. However, two PRC1 species, ncPRC1.3 and ncPRC1.5, are known to comprise novel components, AUTS2, P300, and CK2, that convert this repressive function to that of transcription activation. Here, we report that individuals harboring mutations in the HX repeat domain of AUTS2 exhibit defects in AUTS2 and P300 interaction as well as a developmental disorder reflective of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, which is mainly associated with a heterozygous pathogenic variant in CREBBP/EP300. Moreover, the absence of AUTS2 or mutation in its HX repeat domain gives rise to misregulation of a subset of developmental genes and curtails motor neuron differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. The transcription factor nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) has a novel and integral role in this neurodevelopmental process, being required for ncPRC1.3 recruitment to chromatin.

34818538	Mouse hematopoietic tissues contain abundant tissue-resident macrophages that support immunity, hematopoiesis, and bone homeostasis. A systematic strategy to characterize macrophage subsets in mouse bone marrow (BM), spleen, and lymph node unexpectedly reveals that macrophage surface marker staining emanates from membrane-bound subcellular remnants associated with unrelated cells. Intact macrophages are not present within these cell preparations. The macrophage remnant binding profile reflects interactions between macrophages and other cell types in vivo. Depletion of CD169(+) macrophages in vivo eliminates F4/80(+) remnant attachment. Remnant-restricted macrophage-specific membrane markers, cytoplasmic fluorescent reporters, and mRNA are all detected in non-macrophage cells including isolated stem and progenitor cells. Analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, including publicly available datasets, indicates that macrophage fragmentation is a general phenomenon that confounds bulk and single-cell analysis of disaggregated hematopoietic tissues. Hematopoietic tissue macrophage fragmentation undermines the accuracy of macrophage ex vivo molecular profiling and creates opportunity for misattribution of macrophage-expressed genes to non-macrophage cells.

34965429	Although prokaryotic organisms lack traditional organelles, they must still organize cellular structures in space and time, challenges that different species solve differently. To systematically define the subcellular architecture of mycobacteria, we perform high-throughput imaging of a library of fluorescently tagged proteins expressed in Mycobacterium smegmatis and develop a customized computational pipeline, MOMIA and GEMATRIA, to analyze these data. Our results establish a spatial organization network of over 700 conserved mycobacterial proteins and reveal a coherent localization pattern for many proteins of known function, including those in translation, energy metabolism, cell growth and division, as well as proteins of unknown function. Furthermore, our pipeline exploits morphologic proxies to enable a pseudo-temporal approximation of protein localization and identifies previously uncharacterized cell-cycle-dependent dynamics of essential mycobacterial proteins. Collectively, these data provide a systems perspective on the subcellular organization of mycobacteria and provide tools for the analysis of bacteria with non-standard growth characteristics.

34562372	mRNA translation is a highly conserved and tightly controlled mechanism for protein synthesis. Despite protein quality control mechanisms, amino acid shortage in melanoma induces aberrant proteins by ribosomal frameshifting. The extent and the underlying mechanisms related to this phenomenon are yet unknown. Here, we show that tryptophan depletion-induced ribosomal frameshifting is a widespread phenomenon in cancer. We termed this event sloppiness and strikingly observed its association with MAPK pathway hyperactivation. Sloppiness is stimulated by RAS activation in primary cells, suppressed by pharmacological inhibition of the oncogenic MAPK pathway in sloppy cells, and restored in cells with acquired resistance to MAPK pathway inhibition. Interestingly, sloppiness causes aberrant peptide presentation at the cell surface, allowing recognition and specific killing of drug-resistant cancer cells by T lymphocytes. Thus, while oncogenes empower cancer progression and aggressiveness, they also expose a vulnerability by provoking the production of aberrant peptides through sloppiness.

34496257	Persistent cytoplasmic aggregates containing RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are central to the pathogenesis of late-onset neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These aggregates share components, molecular mechanisms, and cellular protein quality control pathways with stress-induced RNA granules (SGs). Here, we assess the impact of stress on the global mRNA localization landscape of human pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons (PSC-MNs) using subcellular fractionation with RNA sequencing and proteomics. Transient stress disrupts subcellular RNA and protein distributions, alters the RNA binding profile of SG- and ALS-relevant RBPs and recapitulates disease-associated molecular changes such as aberrant splicing of STMN2. Although neurotypical PSC-MNs re-establish a normal subcellular localization landscape upon recovery from stress, cells harboring ALS-linked mutations are intransigent and display a delayed-onset increase in neuronal cell death. Our results highlight subcellular molecular distributions as predictive features and underscore the utility of cellular stress as a paradigm to study ALS-relevant mechanisms.

34420035	The methyl-CpG-binding domain 2 (MBD2) interprets DNA methylome-encoded information through binding to the methylated CpG DNA, by which it regulates target gene expression at the transcriptional level. Although derailed DNA methylation has long been recognized to trigger or promote autoimmune responses in type 1 diabetes (T1D), the exact role of MBD2 in T1D pathogenesis, however, remains poorly defined. Herein, we generated an Mbd2 knockout model in the NOD background and found that Mbd2 deficiency exacerbated the development of spontaneous T1D in NOD mice. Adoptive transfer of Mbd2(-/)(-) CD4 T cells into NOD.scid mice further confirmed the observation. Mechanistically, Th1 stimulation rendered the Stat1 promoter to undergo a DNA methylation turnover featured by the changes of DNA methylation levels or patterns along with the induction of MBD2 expression, which then bound to the methylated CpG DNA within the Stat1 promoter, by which MBD2 maintains the homeostasis of Th1 program to prevent autoimmunity. As a result, ectopic MBD2 expression alleviated CD4 T cell diabetogenicity following their adoptive transfer into NOD.scid mice. Collectively, our data suggest that MBD2 could be a viable target to develop epigenetic-based therapeutics against T1D in clinical settings.	MBD2 acts as a repressor to maintain the homeostasis of the Th1 program in type 1 diabetes by regulating the STAT1-IFN-gamma axis.	Cell death and differentiation	2.0	0
34433063	An effective combination of multi-omic datasets can enhance our understanding of complex biological phenomena. To build a context-dependent network with multiple omic layers, i.e., a trans-omic network, we perform phosphoproteomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics of murine liver for 4 h after insulin administration and integrate the resulting time series. Structural characteristics and dynamic nature of the network are analyzed to elucidate the impact of insulin. Early and prominent changes in protein phosphorylation and persistent and asynchronous changes in mRNA and protein levels through non-transcriptional mechanisms indicate enhanced crosstalk between phosphorylation-mediated signaling and protein expression regulation. Metabolic response shows different temporal regulation with transient increases at early time points across categories and enhanced response in the amino acid and nucleotide categories at later time points as a result of process convergence. This extensive and dynamic view of the trans-omic network elucidates prominent regulatory mechanisms that drive insulin responses through intricate interlayer coordination.

34508778	The hepatic carbohydrate-recognizing asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGR1) mediates the endocytosis/lysosomal degradation of desialylated glycoproteins following binding to terminal galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine. Human heterozygote carriers of ASGR1 deletions exhibit approximately 34% lower risk of coronary artery disease and approximately 10% to 14% reduction of non-HDL cholesterol. Since the proprotein convertase PCSK9 is a major degrader of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), we investigated the degradation and functionality of LDLR and/or PCSK9 by endogenous/overexpressed ASGR1 using Western blot and immunofluorescence in HepG2-naive and HepG2-PCSK9-knockout cells. ASGR1, like PCSK9, targets LDLR, and both independently interact with/enhance the degradation of the receptor. This lack of cooperativity between PCSK9 and ASGR1 was confirmed in livers of wildtype (WT) and Pcsk9(-/-) mice. ASGR1 knockdown in HepG2-naive cells significantly increased total ( approximately 1.2-fold) and cell-surface ( approximately 4-fold) LDLR protein. In HepG2-PCSK9-knockout cells, ASGR1 silencing led to approximately 2-fold higher levels of LDLR protein and DiI (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate)-LDL uptake associated with approximately 9-fold increased cell-surface LDLR. Overexpression of WT-ASGR1/2 primarily reduced levels of immature non-O-glycosylated LDLR ( approximately 110 kDa), whereas the triple Ala-mutant of Gln240/Trp244/Glu253 (characterized by loss of carbohydrate binding) reduced expression of the mature form of LDLR ( approximately 150 kDa), suggesting that ASGR1 binds the LDLR in both a sugar-dependent and -independent fashion. The protease furin cleaves ASGR1 at the RKMK(103) downward arrow motif into a secreted form, likely resulting in a loss of function on LDLR. Altogether, we demonstrate that LDLR is the first example of a liver-receptor ligand of ASGR1. We conclude that silencing of ASGR1 and PCSK9 may lead to higher LDL uptake by hepatocytes, thereby providing a novel approach to further reduce LDL cholesterol levels.	Asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 is a novel PCSK9-independent ligand of liver LDLR cleaved by furin.	The Journal of biological chemistry	4.0	1
34929163	DNA polymerase eta (Poleta) is a unique translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) enzyme required for the error-free bypass of ultraviolet ray (UV)-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in DNA. Therefore, its deficiency confers cellular sensitivity to UV radiation and an increased rate of UV-induced mutagenesis. Poleta possesses a ubiquitin-binding zinc finger (ubz) domain and a PCNA-interacting-protein (pip) motif in the carboxy-terminal region. The role of the Poleta pip motif in PCNA interaction required for DNA polymerase recruitment to the stalled replication fork has been demonstrated in earlier studies; however, the function of the ubz domain remains divisive. As per the current notion, the ubz domain of Poleta binds to the ubiquitin moiety of the ubiquitinated PCNA, but such interaction is found to be nonessential for Poleta's function. In this study, through amino acid sequence alignments, we identify three classes of Poleta among different species based on the presence or absence of pip motif or ubz domain and using comprehensive mutational analyses, we show that the ubz domain of Poleta, which intrinsically lacks the pip motif directly binds to the interdomain connecting loop (IDCL) of PCNA and regulates Poleta's TLS activity. We further propose two distinct modes of PCNA interaction mediated either by pip motif or ubz domain in various Poleta homologs. When the pip motif or ubz domain of a given Poleta binds to the IDCL of PCNA, such interaction becomes essential, whereas the binding of ubz domain to PCNA through ubiquitin is dispensable for Poleta's function.	The ubiquitin-binding domain of DNA polymerase eta directly binds to DNA clamp PCNA and regulates translesion DNA synthesis.	The Journal of biological chemistry	4.0	1
34706234	Dysregulated inflammation dominated by chemokine expression is a key feature of disease following infection with the globally important human pathogens Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus, but a mechanistic understanding of how pro-inflammatory responses are initiated is lacking. Mitophagy is a quality-control mechanism that regulates innate immune signaling and cytokine production through selective degradation of damaged mitochondria. Here, we demonstrate that ZIKV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) antagonizes mitophagy by binding to the host protein Ajuba and preventing its translocation to depolarized mitochondria where it is required for PINK1 activation and downstream signaling. Consequent mitophagy suppression amplifies the production of pro-inflammatory chemokines through protein kinase R (PKR) sensing of mitochondrial RNA. In Ajuba(-/-) mice, ZIKV induces early expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines associated with significantly enhanced dissemination to tissues. This work identifies Ajuba as a critical regulator of mitophagy and demonstrates a role for mitophagy in limiting systemic inflammation following infection by globally important human viruses.	Mitophagy antagonism by ZIKV reveals Ajuba as a regulator of PINK1 signaling, PKR-dependent inflammation, and viral invasion of tissues.	Cell reports	2.5	1
34710354	Current coronavirus (CoV) vaccines primarily target immunodominant epitopes in the S1 subunit, which are poorly conserved and susceptible to escape mutations, thus threatening vaccine efficacy. Here, we use structure-guided protein engineering to remove the S1 subunit from the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein and develop stabilized stem (SS) antigens. Vaccination with MERS SS elicits cross-reactive beta-CoV antibody responses and protects mice against lethal MERS-CoV challenge. High-throughput screening of antibody-secreting cells from MERS SS-immunized mice led to the discovery of a panel of cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies. Among them, antibody IgG22 binds with high affinity to both MERS-CoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 S proteins, and a combination of electron microscopy and crystal structures localizes the epitope to a conserved coiled-coil region in the S2 subunit.

34954144	G6PC2 encodes a glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) catalytic subunit that modulates the sensitivity of insulin secretion to glucose and thereby regulates fasting blood glucose (FBG). A common single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in G6PC2, rs560887 is an important determinant of human FBG variability. This SNP has a subtle effect on G6PC2 RNA splicing, which raises the question as to whether nonsynonymous SNPs with a major impact on G6PC2 stability or enzyme activity might have a broader disease/metabolic impact. Previous attempts to characterize such SNPs were limited by the very low inherent G6Pase activity and expression of G6PC2 protein in islet-derived cell lines. In this study, we describe the use of a plasmid vector that confers high G6PC2 protein expression in islet cells, allowing for a functional analysis of 22 nonsynonymous G6PC2 SNPs, 19 of which alter amino acids that are conserved in mouse G6PC2 and the human and mouse variants of the related G6PC1 isoform. We show that 16 of these SNPs markedly impair G6PC2 protein expression (>50% decrease). These SNPs have variable effects on the stability of human and mouse G6PC1, despite the high sequence homology between these isoforms. Four of the remaining six SNPs impaired G6PC2 enzyme activity. Electronic health record-derived phenotype analyses showed an association between high-impact SNPs and FBG, but not other diseases/metabolites. While homozygous G6pc2 deletion in mice increases the risk of hypoglycemia, these human data reveal no evidence that the beneficial use of partial G6PC2 inhibitors to lower FBG would be associated with unintended negative consequences.

34995509	Acetyl-CoA is a key intermediate situated at the intersection of many metabolic pathways. The reliance of histone acetylation on acetyl-CoA enables the coordination of gene expression with metabolic state. Abundant acetyl-CoA has been linked to the activation of genes involved in cell growth or tumorigenesis through histone acetylation. However, the role of histone acetylation in transcription under low levels of acetyl-CoA remains poorly understood. Here, we use a yeast starvation model to observe the dramatic alteration in the global occupancy of histone acetylation following carbon starvation; the location of histone acetylation marks shifts from growth-promoting genes to gluconeogenic and fat metabolism genes. This reallocation is mediated by both the histone deacetylase Rpd3p and the acetyltransferase Gcn5p, a component of the SAGA transcriptional coactivator. Our findings reveal an unexpected switch in the specificity of histone acetylation to promote pathways that generate acetyl-CoA for oxidation when acetyl-CoA is limiting.	Glucose starvation induces a switch in the histone acetylome for activation of gluconeogenic and fat metabolism genes.	Molecular cell	0.0	0
34584217	A key characteristic of cancer cells is their increased proliferative capacity, which requires elevated levels of protein synthesis. The process of protein synthesis involves the translation of codons within the mRNA coding sequence into a string of amino acids to form a polypeptide chain. As most amino acids are encoded by multiple codons, the nucleotide sequence of a coding region can vary dramatically without altering the polypeptide sequence of the encoded protein. Although mutations that do not alter the final amino acid sequence are often thought of as silent/synonymous, these can still have dramatic effects on protein output. Because each codon has a distinct translation elongation rate and can differentially impact mRNA stability, each codon has a different degree of 'optimality' for protein synthesis. Recent data demonstrates that the codon preference of a transcriptome matches the abundance of tRNAs within the cell and that this supply and demand between tRNAs and mRNAs varies between different cell types. The largest observed distinction is between mRNAs encoding proteins associated with proliferation or differentiation. Nevertheless, precisely how codon optimality and tRNA expression levels regulate cell fate decisions and their role in malignancy is not fully understood. This review describes the current mechanistic understanding on codon optimality, its role in malignancy and discusses the potential to target codon optimality therapeutically in the context of cancer.

34587481	Despite the worldwide effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the underlying mechanisms of fatal viral pneumonia remain elusive. Here, we show that critical COVID-19 is associated with enhanced eosinophil-mediated inflammation when compared to non-critical cases. In addition, we confirm increased T helper (Th)2-biased adaptive immune responses, accompanying overt complement activation, in the critical group. Moreover, enhanced antibody responses and complement activation are associated with disease pathogenesis as evidenced by formation of immune complexes and membrane attack complexes in airways and vasculature of lung biopsies from six fatal cases, as well as by enhanced hallmark gene set signatures of Fcgamma receptor (FcgammaR) signaling and complement activation in myeloid cells of respiratory specimens from critical COVID-19 patients. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may drive specific innate immune responses, including eosinophil-mediated inflammation, and subsequent pulmonary pathogenesis via enhanced Th2-biased immune responses, which might be crucial drivers of critical disease in COVID-19 patients.

34411541	Unrelated individuals can produce genetically similar clones of antibodies, known as public clonotypes, which have been seen in responses to different infectious diseases, as well as healthy individuals. Here we identify 37 public clonotypes in memory B cells from convalescent survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or in plasmablasts from an individual after vaccination with mRNA-encoded spike protein. We identify 29 public clonotypes, including clones recognizing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein S1 subunit (including a neutralizing, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [ACE2]-blocking clone that protects in vivo) and others recognizing non-RBD epitopes that bind the S2 domain. Germline-revertant forms of some public clonotypes bind efficiently to spike protein, suggesting these common germline-encoded antibodies are preconfigured for avid recognition. Identification of large numbers of public clonotypes provides insight into the molecular basis of efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and sheds light on the immune pressures driving the selection of common viral escape mutants.

34644566	Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PNENs) are biologically and clinically heterogeneous. Here, we use a multi-omics approach to uncover the molecular factors underlying this heterogeneity. Transcriptomic analysis of 84 PNEN specimens, drawn from two cohorts, is substantiated with proteomic profiling and identifies four subgroups: Proliferative, PDX1-high, Alpha cell-like and Stromal/Mesenchymal. The Proliferative subgroup, consisting of both well- and poorly differentiated specimens, is associated with inferior overall survival probability. The PDX1-high and Alpha cell-like subgroups partially resemble previously described subtypes, and we further uncover distinctive metabolism-related features in the Alpha cell-like subgroup. The Stromal/Mesenchymal subgroup exhibits molecular characteristics of YAP1/WWTR1(TAZ) activation suggestive of Hippo signaling pathway involvement in PNENs. Whole-exome sequencing reveals subgroup-enriched mutational differences, supported by activity inference analysis, and identifies hypermorphic proto-oncogene variants in 14.3% of sequenced PNENs. Our study reveals differences in cellular signaling axes that provide potential directions for PNEN patient stratification and treatment strategies.

34910911	Plants tailor immune responses to defend against pathogens with different lifestyles. In this process, antagonism between the immune hormones salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) optimizes transcriptional signatures specifically to the attacker encountered. Antagonism is controlled by the transcription cofactor NPR1. The indispensable role of NPR1 in activating SA-responsive genes is well understood, but how it functions as a repressor of JA-responsive genes remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that SA-induced NPR1 is recruited to JA-responsive promoter regions that are co-occupied by a JA-induced transcription complex consisting of the MYC2 activator and MED25 Mediator subunit. In the presence of SA, NPR1 physically associates with JA-induced MYC2 and inhibits transcriptional activation by disrupting its interaction with MED25. Importantly, NPR1-mediated inhibition of MYC2 is a major immune mechanism for suppressing pathogen virulence. Thus, NPR1 orchestrates the immune transcriptome not only by activating SA-responsive genes but also by acting as a corepressor of JA-responsive MYC2.	Suppression of MYC transcription activators by the immune cofactor NPR1 fine-tunes plant immune responses.	Cell reports	3.0	1
34450161	GGGGCC (G4C2) repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene has been shown to cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Dipeptide repeat proteins produced through repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation are recognized as potential drivers for neurodegeneration. Therefore, selective inhibition of RAN translation could be a therapeutic avenue to treat these neurodegenerative diseases. It was previously known that the porphyrin TMPyP4 binds to G4C2 repeat RNA. However, the consequences of this interaction have not been well characterized. Here, we confirmed that TMPyP4 inhibits C9orf72 G4C2 repeat translation in cellular and in in vitro translation systems. An artificial insertion of an AUG codon failed to cancel the translation inhibition, suggesting that TMPyP4 acts downstream of non-AUG translation initiation. Polysome profiling assays also revealed polysome retention on G4C2 repeat RNA, along with inhibition of translation, indicating that elongating ribosomes stall on G4C2 repeat RNA. Urea-resistant interaction between G4C2 repeat RNA and TMPyP4 likely contributes to this ribosome stalling and thus to selective inhibition of RAN translation. Taken together, our data reveal a novel mode of action of TMPyP4 as an inhibitor of G4C2 repeat translation elongation.

34965425	Ongoing neural activity has been observed across several brain regions and is thought to reflect the internal state of the brain. Yet, it is important to understand how ongoing neural activity interacts with sensory experience and shapes sensory representations. Here, we show that the projection neurons of the fruit fly antennal lobe exhibit spatiotemporally organized ongoing activity. After repeated exposure to odors, we observe a gradual and cumulative decrease in the amplitude and number of calcium events occurring in the absence of odor stimulation, as well as a reorganization of correlations between olfactory glomeruli. Accompanying these plastic changes, we find that repeated odor experience decreases trial-to-trial variability and enhances the specificity of odor representations. Our results reveal an odor-experience-dependent modulation of ongoing and sensory-evoked activity at peripheral levels of the fruit fly olfactory system.	Experience-dependent plasticity modulates ongoing activity in the antennal lobe and enhances odor representations.	Cell reports	0.0	0
34686329	Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs) are a family of kinases that control fundamental processes, including cell growth, DNA damage repair, and gene expression. Although their regulation and activities are well characterized, little is known about how PIKKs fold and assemble into active complexes. Previous work has identified a heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) cochaperone, the TTT complex, that specifically stabilizes PIKKs. Here, we describe a mechanism by which TTT promotes their de novo maturation in fission yeast. We show that TTT recognizes newly synthesized PIKKs during translation. Although PIKKs form multimeric complexes, we find that they do not engage in cotranslational assembly with their partners. Rather, our findings suggest a model by which TTT protects nascent PIKK polypeptides from misfolding and degradation because PIKKs acquire their native state after translation is terminated. Thus, PIKK maturation and assembly are temporally segregated, suggesting that the biogenesis of large complexes requires both dedicated chaperones and cotranslational interactions between subunits.	The Hsp90 cochaperone TTT promotes cotranslational maturation of PIKKs prior to complex assembly.	Cell reports	0.0	0
34525355	Mammalian cell cytoskeletal reorganization for efficient directional movement requires tight coordination of actomyosin and microtubule networks. In this study, we show that LRAP35a potentiates microtubule stabilization by promoting CLASP2/EB1 interaction besides its complex formation with MRCK/MYO18A for retrograde actin flow. The alternate regulation of these two networks by LRAP35a is tightly regulated by a series of phosphorylation events that dictated its specificity. Sequential phosphorylation of LRAP35a by Protein Kinase A (PKA) and Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) initiates the association of LRAP35a with CLASP2, while subsequent binding and further phosphorylation by Casein Kinase 1delta (CK1delta) induce their dissociation, which facilitates LRAP35a/MRCK association in driving lamellar actomyosin flow. Importantly, microtubule dynamics is directly moderated by CK1delta activity on CLASP2 to regulate GSK3beta phosphorylation of the SxIP motifs that blocks EB1 binding, an event countered by LRAP35a interaction and its competition for CK1delta activity. Overall this study reveals an essential role for LRAP35a in coordinating lamellar contractility and microtubule polarization in cell migration.

34793834	Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis in lymphopenic patients. Pulmonary macrophages comprise the first line of host defense upon inhalation of fungal spores by aiding in clearance but can also potentially serve as a niche for their dissemination. Given that macrophages play a key role in the outcome of a cryptococcal infection, it is crucial to understand factors that mediate phagocytosis of C. neoformans. Since lipid rafts (high-order plasma membrane domains enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin [SM]) have been implicated in facilitating phagocytosis, we evaluated whether these ordered domains govern macrophages' ability to phagocytose C. neoformans. We found that cholesterol or SM depletion resulted in significantly deficient immunoglobulin G (IgG)-mediated phagocytosis of fungus. Moreover, repletion of macrophage cells with a raft-promoting sterol (7-dehydrocholesterol) rescued this phagocytic deficiency, whereas a raft-inhibiting sterol (coprostanol) significantly decreased IgG-mediated phagocytosis of C. neoformans. Using a photoswitchable SM (AzoSM), we observed that the raft-promoting conformation (trans-AzoSM) resulted in efficient phagocytosis, whereas the raft-inhibiting conformation (cis-AzoSM) significantly but reversibly blunted phagocytosis. We observed that the effect on phagocytosis may be facilitated by Fcgamma receptor (FcgammaR) function, whereby IgG immune complexes crosslink to FcgammaRIII, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of FcR gamma-subunit (FcRgamma), an important accessory protein in the FcgammaR signaling cascade. Correspondingly, cholesterol or SM depletion resulted in decreased FcRgamma phosphorylation. Repletion with 7-dehydrocholesterol restored phosphorylation, whereas repletion with coprostanol showed FcRgamma phosphorylation comparable to unstimulated cells. Together, these data suggest that lipid rafts are critical for facilitating FcgammaRIII-mediated phagocytosis of C. neoformans.

35007530	Skeletal muscle myosin (SkM) has been shown to possess procoagulant activity; however, the mechanisms of this coagulation-enhancing activity involving plasma coagulation pathways and factors are incompletely understood. Here, we discovered direct interactions between immobilized SkM and coagulation factor XI (FXI) using biolayer interferometry (Kd = 0.2 nM). In contrast, we show that prekallikrein, a FXI homolog, did not bind to SkM, reflecting the specificity of SkM for FXI binding. We also found that the anti-FXI monoclonal antibody, mAb 1A6, which recognizes the Apple (A) 3 domain of FXI, potently inhibited binding of FXI to immobilized SkM, implying that SkM binds FXI A3 domain. In addition, we show that SkM enhanced FXI activation by thrombin in a concentration-dependent manner. We further used recombinant FXI chimeric proteins in which each of the four A domains of the heavy chain (designated A1 through A4) was individually replaced with the corresponding A domain from prekallikrein to investigate SkM-mediated enhancement of thrombin-induced FXI activation. These results indicated that activation of two FXI chimeras with substitutions of either the A3 domains or A4 domains was not enhanced by SkM, whereas substitution of the A2 domain did not reduce the thrombin-induced activation compared with wildtype FXI. These data strongly suggest that functional interaction sites on FXI for SkM involve the A3 and A4 domains. Thus, this study is the first to reveal and support the novel intrinsic blood coagulation pathway concept that the procoagulant mechanisms of SkM include FXI binding and enhancement of FXI activation by thrombin.

34818546	Tissue damage induces immediate-early signals, activating Rho small GTPases to trigger actin polymerization essential for later wound repair. However, how tissue damage is sensed to activate Rho small GTPases locally remains elusive. Here, we found that wounding the C. elegans epidermis induces rapid relocalization of CDC-42 into plasma membrane-associated clusters, which subsequently recruits WASP/WSP-1 to trigger actin polymerization to close the wound. In addition, wounding induces a local transient increase and subsequent reduction of H2O2, which negatively regulates the clustering of CDC-42 and wound closure. CDC-42 CAAX motif-mediated prenylation and polybasic region-mediated cation-phospholipid interaction are both required for its clustering. Cysteine residues participate in intermolecular disulfide bonds to reduce membrane association and are required for negative regulation of CDC-42 clustering by H2O2. Collectively, our findings suggest that H2O2-regulated fine-tuning of CDC-42 localization can create a distinct biomolecular cluster that facilitates rapid epithelial wound repair after injury.

34785213	N-myc-downregulated gene 1 (NDRG1) has potent anticancer effects and inhibits cell growth, survival, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Previous studies suggested that NDRG1 is linked to the androgen signaling network, but this mechanistic relationship is unclear. Considering the crucial role of the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer (PCa) progression, here we examined for the first time the effect of NDRG1 on AR expression, activation, and downstream signaling in LNCaP, 22Rv1, and C4-2B PCa cell types. We demonstrate that NDRG1 effectively promotes interaction of AR with the chaperone HSP90, which in turn stabilizes the AR while decreasing its androgen-mediated activation. The expression of NDRG1 suppressed: (1) AR activation, as measured by p-AR(Ser213) and p-AR(Ser81); (2) expression of a major AR transcriptional target, prostate-specific antigen (PSA); and (3) AR transcriptional activity, probably via inhibiting the c-Jun-AR interaction by reducing c-Jun phosphorylation (p-c-Jun(Ser63)). NDRG1 was also demonstrated to inhibit multiple key molecules involved in androgen-dependent and -independent signaling (namely EGFR, HER2, HER3, PI3K, STAT3, and NF-kappaB), which promote the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer. We also identified the cysteine-rich secretory protein/antigen 5/pathogenesis related-1 (CAP) domain of NDRG1 as vital for inhibition of AR activity. Examining NDRG1 and p-NDRG1 in PCa patient specimens revealed a significant negative correlation between NDRG1 and PSA levels in prostatectomy patients that went on to develop metastasis. These results highlight a vital role for NDRG1 in androgen signaling and its potential as a key therapeutic target and biomarker in PCa.

34879280	Viruses rearrange host membranes to support different entry steps. Polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40) reorganizes the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to generate focus structures that enable virus ER-to-cytosol escape, a decisive infection step. The molecular architecture of the ER exit site that might illuminate why it is ideally suited for membrane penetration is unknown. Here 3D focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) reconstruction reveals that the ER focus structure consists of multi-tubular ER junctions where SV40 preferentially localizes, suggesting that tubular branch points are virus ER-to-cytosol penetration sites. Functional analysis demonstrates that lunapark-an ER membrane protein that typically stabilizes three-way ER junctions-relocates to the ER foci, where it supports focus formation, leading to SV40 ER escape and infection. Our results reveal how a virus repurposes the activity of an ER membrane protein to form a virus-induced ER substructure required for membrane escape and suggest that ER tubular junctions are vulnerable sites exploited by viruses for membrane penetration.	Lunapark-dependent formation of a virus-induced ER exit site contains multi-tubular ER junctions that promote viral ER-to-cytosol escape.	Cell reports	0.0	0
34965436	The eukaryotic TORC1 kinase assimilates diverse environmental cues, including growth factors and nutrients, to control growth by tuning anabolic and catabolic processes. In yeast, TORC1 stimulates protein synthesis in response to abundant nutrients primarily through its proximal effector kinase Sch9. Conversely, TORC1 inhibition following nutrient limitation unlocks various distally controlled kinases (e.g., Atg1, Gcn2, Npr1, Rim15, Slt2/Mpk1, and Yak1), which cooperate through poorly defined circuits to orchestrate the quiescence program. To better define the signaling landscape of the latter kinases, we use in vivo quantitative phosphoproteomics. Through pinpointing known and uncharted Npr1, Rim15, Slt2/Mpk1, and Yak1 effectors, our study examines the architecture of the distally controlled TORC1 kinase network. Accordingly, this is built on a combination of discrete, convergent, and multilayered feedback regulatory mechanisms, which likely ensure homeostatic control of and/or robust responses by TORC1 and its effector kinases under fluctuating nutritional conditions.

34644572	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified hundreds of signals associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). To gain insight into their underlying molecular mechanisms, we have created the translational human pancreatic islet genotype tissue-expression resource (TIGER), aggregating >500 human islet genomic datasets from five cohorts in the Horizon 2020 consortium T2DSystems. We impute genotypes using four reference panels and meta-analyze cohorts to improve the coverage of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and develop a method to combine allele-specific expression across samples (cASE). We identify >1 million islet eQTLs, 53 of which colocalize with T2D signals. Among them, a low-frequency allele that reduces T2D risk by half increases CCND2 expression. We identify eight cASE colocalizations, among which we found a T2D-associated SLC30A8 variant. We make all data available through the TIGER portal (http://tiger.bsc.es), which represents a comprehensive human islet genomic data resource to elucidate how genetic variation affects islet function and translates into therapeutic insight and precision medicine for T2D.

34556815	Neuroblastoma (NB) has a low frequency of recurrent mutations compared to other cancers, which hinders the development of targeted therapies and novel risk stratification strategies. Multikinase inhibitors have shown potential in treating high-risk NB, but their efficacy is likely impaired by the cancer cells' ability to adapt to these drugs through the employment of alternative signaling pathways. Based on the expression of 48 growth factor-related genes in 1189 NB tumors, we have developed a model for NB patient survival prediction. This model discriminates between stage 4 NB tumors with favorable outcomes (>80% overall survival) and very poor outcomes (<10%) independently from MYCN-amplification status. Using signaling pathway analysis and gene set enrichment methods in 60 NB patients with known therapy response, we identified signaling pathways, including EPO, NGF, and HGF, upregulated in patients with no or partial response. In a therapeutic setting, we showed that among six selected growth factors, EPO, and NGF showed the most pronounced protective effects in vitro against several promising anti-NB multikinase inhibitors: imatinib, dasatinib, crizotinib, cabozantinib, and axitinib. Mechanistically kinase inhibitors potentiated NB cells to stronger ERK activation by EPO and NGF. The protective action of these growth factors strongly correlated with ERK activation and was ERK-dependent. ERK inhibitors combined with anticancer drugs, especially with dasatinib, showed a synergistic effect on NB cell death. Consideration of growth factor signaling activity benefits NB outcome prediction and tailoring therapy regimens to treat NB.

34634301	Metabolic dysfunction is a major driver of tumorigenesis. The serine/threonine kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) constitutes a key central regulator of metabolic pathways promoting cancer cell proliferation and survival. mTOR activity is regulated by metabolic sensors as well as by numerous factors comprising the phosphatase and tensin homolog/PI3K/AKT canonical pathway, which are often mutated in cancer. However, some cancers displaying constitutively active mTOR do not carry alterations within this canonical pathway, suggesting alternative modes of mTOR regulation. Since DEPTOR, an endogenous inhibitor of mTOR, was previously found to modulate both mTOR complexes 1 and 2, we investigated the different post-translational modification that could affect its inhibitory function. We found that tyrosine (Tyr) 289 phosphorylation of DEPTOR impairs its interaction with mTOR, leading to increased mTOR activation. Using proximity biotinylation assays, we identified SYK (spleen tyrosine kinase) as a kinase involved in DEPTOR Tyr 289 phosphorylation in an ephrin (erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma) receptor-dependent manner. Altogether, our work reveals that phosphorylation of Tyr 289 of DEPTOR represents a novel molecular switch involved in the regulation of both mTOR complex 1 and mTOR complex 2.

34633746	Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) is a tumor suppressor possessing multiple modes of action, including induction of apoptosis. We unexpectedly find that PML promotes necroptosis in addition to apoptosis, with Pml(-/-) macrophages being more resistant to TNF-mediated necroptosis than wild-type counterparts and PML-deficient mice displaying resistance to TNF-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Reduced necroptosis in PML-deficient cells is associated with attenuated receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) activation, as revealed by reduced RIPK1[S166] phosphorylation, and attenuated RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL necrosome complex formation. We show that PML deficiency leads to enhanced TNF-induced MAPK-activated kinase 2 (MK2) activation and elevated RIPK1[S321] phosphorylation, which suppresses necrosome formation. MK2 inhibitor treatment or MK2 knockout abrogates resistance to cell death induction in PML-null cells and mice. PML binds MK2 and p38 MAPK, thereby inhibiting p38-MK2 interaction and MK2 activation. Moreover, PML participates in autocrine production of TNF induced by cellular inhibitors of apoptosis 1 (cIAP1)/cIAP2 degradation, since PML-knockout attenuates autocrine TNF. Thus, by targeting MK2 activation and autocrine TNF, PML promotes necroptosis and apoptosis, representing a novel tumor-suppressive activity for PML.

34428449	S-acylation, also known as palmitoylation, is the most widely prevalent form of protein lipidation, whereby long-chain fatty acids get attached to cysteine residues facing the cytosol. In humans, 23 members of the zDHHC family of integral membrane enzymes catalyze this modification. S-acylation is critical for the life cycle of many enveloped viruses. The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has the most cysteine-rich cytoplasmic tail among known human pathogens in the closely related family of beta-coronaviruses; however, it is unclear which of the cytoplasmic cysteines are S-acylated, and what the impact of this modification is on viral infectivity. Here we identify specific cysteine clusters in the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that are targets of S-acylation. Interestingly, when we investigated the effect of the cysteine clusters using pseudotyped virus, mutation of the same three clusters of cysteines severely compromised viral infectivity. We developed a library of expression constructs of human zDHHC enzymes and used them to identify zDHHC enzymes that can S-acylate SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Finally, we reconstituted S-acylation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in vitro using purified zDHHC enzymes. We observe a striking heterogeneity in the S-acylation status of the different cysteines in our in cellulo experiments, which, remarkably, was recapitulated by the in vitro assay. Altogether, these results bolster our understanding of a poorly understood posttranslational modification integral to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. This study opens up avenues for further mechanistic dissection and lays the groundwork toward developing future strategies that could aid in the identification of targeted small-molecule modulators.

34663878	R-spondin (RSPO) proteins constitute a family of four secreted glycoproteins (RSPO1-4) that have appeared as multipotent signaling ligands. The best-known molecular function of RSPOs lie within their capacity to agonize the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. As RSPOs act upon cognate receptors LGR4/5/6 that are typically expressed by stem cells and progenitor cells, RSPO proteins importantly potentiate Wnt/beta-catenin signaling especially within these proliferative stem cell compartments. Since multiple organs express LGR4/5/6 receptors and RSPO ligands within their stem cell niches, RSPOs can exert an influential role in stem cell regulation throughout the body. Inherently, over the last decade a multitude of reports implicated the deregulation of RSPOs in cancer development. First, RSPO2 and RSPO3 gene fusions with concomitant enhanced expression have been identified in colon cancer patients, and proposed as an alternative driver of Wnt/beta-catenin hyperactivation that earmarks cancer in the colorectal tract. Moreover, the causal oncogenic capacity of RSPO3 overactivation has been demonstrated in the mouse intestine. As a paradigm organ in this field, most of current knowledge about RSPOs in cancer is derived from studies in the intestinal tract. However, RSPO gene fusions as well as enhanced RSPO expression have been reported in multiple additional cancer types, affecting different organs that involve divergent stem cell hierarchies. Importantly, the emerging oncogenic role of RSPO and its potential clinical utility as a therapeutic target have been recognized and investigated in preclinical and clinical settings. This review provides a survey of current knowledge on the role of RSPOs in cancer biology, addressing the different organs implicated, and of efforts made to explore intervention opportunities in cancer cases with RSPO overrepresentation, including the potential utilization of RSPO as novel therapeutic target itself.

35027733	Heavy metals are both integral parts of cells and environmental toxicants, and their deregulation is associated with severe cellular dysfunction and various diseases. Here we show that the Hippo pathway plays a critical role in regulating heavy metal homeostasis. Hippo signalling deficiency promotes the transcription of heavy metal response genes and protects cells from heavy metal-induced toxicity, a process independent of its classic downstream effectors YAP and TAZ. Mechanistically, the Hippo pathway kinase LATS phosphorylates and inhibits MTF1, an essential transcription factor in the heavy metal response, resulting in the loss of heavy metal response gene transcription and cellular protection. Moreover, LATS activity is inhibited following heavy metal treatment, where accumulated zinc directly binds and inhibits LATS. Together, our study reveals an interplay between the Hippo pathway and heavy metals, providing insights into this growth-related pathway in tissue homeostasis and stress response.

34706232	Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) impede antitumor immunity; however, the precise mechanisms that regulate their suppressive function remain unresolved. Identifying these mechanisms could lead to therapeutic interventions to boost cancer immunotherapy efficacy. Here, we reveal that beta2 adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) expression on MDSCs increases with tumor growth and that the beta2-AR stress pathway drives the immune suppressive activity of MDSCs by altering their metabolism. We show that beta2-AR signaling decreases glycolysis and increases oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation (FAO). It also increases expression of the fatty acid transporter CPT1A, which is necessary for the FAO-mediated immunosuppressive function of MDSCs. Moreover, we show that beta2-AR signaling increases autophagy and activates the arachidonic acid cycle, both required for increasing the release of the immunosuppressive mediator, PGE2. Our data reveal that beta2-AR signaling triggered by stress is an important physiological regulator of key metabolic pathways in MDSCs, driving their immunosuppressive function.	beta2-adrenergic receptor signaling regulates metabolic pathways critical to myeloid-derived suppressor cell function within the TME.

34801557	Bacterial fatty acid synthesis in Escherichia coli is initiated by the condensation of an acetyl-CoA with a malonyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) by the beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III enzyme, FabH. E. coli DeltafabH knockout strains are viable because of the yiiD gene that allows FabH-independent fatty acid synthesis initiation. However, the molecular function of the yiiD gene product is not known. Here, we show the yiiD gene product is a malonyl-ACP decarboxylase (MadA). MadA has two independently folded domains: an amino-terminal N-acetyl transferase (GNAT) domain (MadA(N)) and a carboxy-terminal hot dog dimerization domain (MadA(C)) that encodes the malonyl-ACP decarboxylase function. Members of the proteobacterial Mad protein family are either two domain MadA (GNAT-hot dog) or standalone MadB (hot dog) decarboxylases. Using structure-guided, site-directed mutagenesis of MadB from Shewanella oneidensis, we identified Asn45 on a conserved catalytic loop as critical for decarboxylase activity. We also found that MadA, MadA(C), or MadB expression all restored normal cell size and growth rates to an E. coli DeltafabH strain, whereas the expression of MadA(N) did not. Finally, we verified that GlmU, a bifunctional glucosamine-1-phosphate N-acetyl transferase/N-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase that synthesizes the key intermediate UDP-GlcNAc, is an ACP binding protein. Acetyl-ACP is the preferred glucosamine-1-phosphate N-acetyl transferase/N-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase substrate, in addition to being the substrate for the elongation-condensing enzymes FabB and FabF. Thus, we conclude that the Mad family of malonyl-ACP decarboxylases supplies acetyl-ACP to support the initiation of fatty acid, lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, and enterobacterial common antigen biosynthesis in Proteobacteria.

35041461	Most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are diagnosed at a late stage and have few therapeutic options and a poor prognosis. This is due to the lack of clearly defined underlying mechanisms or a dominant oncogene that can be targeted pharmacologically, unlike in other cancer types. Here, we report the identification of a previously uncharacterized oncogenic signaling pathway in HCC that is mediated by the tyrosine kinase Yes. Using genetic and pharmacological interventions in cellular and mouse models of HCC, we showed that Yes activity was necessary for HCC cell proliferation. Transgenic expression of activated Yes in mouse hepatocytes was sufficient to induce liver tumorigenesis. Yes phosphorylated the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ), promoting their nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity in HCC cells and liver tumors. We also showed that YAP/TAZ were effectors of the Yes-dependent oncogenic transformation of hepatocytes. Src family kinase activation correlated with the tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear localization of YAP in human HCC and was associated with increased tumor burden in mice. Specifically, high Yes activity predicted shorter overall survival in patients with HCC. Thus, our findings identify Yes as a potential therapeutic target in HCC.	Signaling by the tyrosine kinase Yes promotes liver cancer development.	Science signaling	4.0	1
34714326	Mechanisms that turn over components of the nucleus and inner nuclear membrane (INM) remain to be fully defined. We explore how components of the INM are selected by a cytosolic autophagy apparatus through a transmembrane nuclear envelope-localized cargo adaptor, Atg39. A split-GFP reporter showed that Atg39 localizes to the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) and thus targets the INM across the nuclear envelope lumen. Consistent with this, sequence elements that confer both nuclear envelope localization and a membrane remodeling activity are mapped to the Atg39 lumenal domain; these lumenal motifs are required for the autophagy-mediated degradation of integral INM proteins. Interestingly, correlative light and electron microscopy shows that the overexpression of Atg39 leads to the expansion of the ONM and the enclosure of a network of INM-derived vesicles in the nuclear envelope lumen. Thus, we propose an outside-in model of nucleophagy where INM is delivered into vesicles in the nuclear envelope lumen, which can be targeted by the autophagosome.	Atg39 selectively captures inner nuclear membrane into lumenal vesicles for delivery to the autophagosome.	The Journal of cell biology	0.0	0
34706239	Inflammasomes are crucial for innate immunity against infections and, when deregulated, also contribute to inflammatory diseases. Here, we identify a critical function of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Peli1 in regulating the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Peli1 deficiency impairs induction of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) secretion by different NLRP3 inducers, but not by inducers of the Aim2, NLRP1, and NLRC4 inflammasomes. Peli1-deficient mice have alleviated peritonitis induction by alum and display increased resistance to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin shock, coupled with decreased serum concentration of IL-1beta. Peli1 is required for NLRP3-induced caspase-1 activation and IL-1beta maturation. Mechanistically, Peli1 conjugates K63 ubiquitin chain to lysine 55 of the inflammasome adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), which in turn facilitates ASC/NLRP3 interaction and ASC oligomerization, thereby contributing to inflammasome activation. Peli1 deficiency impairs the ubiquitination of ASC and inhibits inflammasome activation. Our findings establish Peli1 as an important inflammasome regulator and suggest a mechanism by which Peli1 mediates inflammatory responses.	Peli1 facilitates NLRP3 inflammasome activation by mediating ASC ubiquitination.	Cell reports	2.0	0
34732320	Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a poly-CAG expansion in the first exon of the HTT gene, resulting in an extended poly-glutamine tract in the N-terminal domain of the Huntingtin (Htt) protein product. Proteolytic fragments of the poly-glutamine-containing N-terminal domain form intranuclear aggregates that are correlated with HD. Post-translational modification of Htt has been shown to alter its function and aggregation properties. However, the effect of N-terminal Htt acetylation has not yet been considered. Here, we developed a bacterial system to produce unmodified or N-terminally acetylated and aggregation-inducible Htt protein. We used this system together with biochemical, biophysical, and imaging studies to confirm that the Htt N-terminus is an in vitro substrate for the NatA N-terminal acetyltransferase and show that N-terminal acetylation promotes aggregation. These studies represent the first link between N-terminal acetylation and the promotion of a neurodegenerative disease and implicates NatA-mediated Htt acetylation as a new potential therapeutic target in HD.	N-alpha-acetylation of Huntingtin protein increases its propensity to aggregate.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0.0	0
34779859	The gamma-tubulin complex acts as the predominant microtubule (MT) nucleator that initiates MT formation and is therefore an essential factor for cell proliferation. Nonetheless, cellular MTs are formed after experimental depletion of the gamma-tubulin complex, suggesting that cells possess other factors that drive MT nucleation. Here, by combining gene knockout, auxin-inducible degron, RNA interference, MT depolymerization/regrowth assay, and live microscopy, we identified four microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), ch-TOG, CLASP1, CAMSAPs, and TPX2, which are involved in gamma-tubulin-independent MT generation in human colon cancer cells. In the mitotic MT regrowth assay, nucleated MTs organized noncentriolar MT organizing centers (ncMTOCs) in the absence of gamma-tubulin. Depletion of CLASP1 or TPX2 substantially delayed ncMTOC formation, suggesting that these proteins might promote MT nucleation in the absence of gamma-tubulin. In contrast, depletion of ch-TOG or CAMSAPs did not affect the timing of ncMTOC appearance. CLASP1 also accelerates gamma-tubulin-independent MT regrowth during interphase. Thus, MT generation can be promoted by MAPs without the gamma-tubulin template.

35021100	Understanding the homeostatic mechanism of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells is a critical issue in iNKT cell biology. Because interleukin (IL)-15 is required for the thymic generation of iNKT cells, IL-15 has also been considered necessary for the homeostasis of peripheral iNKT cells. Here, we delineated the in vivo cytokine requirement for iNKT cells, and we came to the surprising conclusion that IL-7, not IL-15, is the homeostatic cytokine for iNKT cells. Employing a series of experimental mouse models where the availability of IL-7 or IL-15 was manipulated in peripheral tissues, either by genetic tools or by adult thymectomy and cytokine pump installation, we demonstrate that the abundance of IL-7, and not IL-15, limits the size of the peripheral iNKT cell pool. These results redefine the cytokine requirement for iNKT cells and indicate competition for IL-7 between iNKT and conventional alphabeta T cells.	In vivo availability of the cytokine IL-7 constrains the survival and homeostasis of peripheral iNKT cells.	Cell reports	0.0	0
34496240	High-risk localized prostate cancer (HRLPC) is associated with a substantial risk of recurrence and disease mortality. Recent clinical trials have shown that intensifying anti-androgen therapies administered before prostatectomy can induce pathologic complete responses or minimal residual disease, called exceptional response, although the molecular determinants of these clinical outcomes are largely unknown. Here, we perform whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing on pre-treatment multi-regional tumor biopsies from exceptional responders (ERs) and non-responders (NRs, pathologic T3 or lymph node-positive disease) to intensive neoadjuvant anti-androgen therapies. Clonal SPOP mutation and SPOPL copy-number loss are exclusively observed in ERs, while clonal TP53 mutation and PTEN copy-number loss are exclusively observed in NRs. Transcriptional programs involving androgen signaling and TGF-beta signaling are enriched in ERs and NRs, respectively. These findings may guide prospective validation studies of these molecular features in large HRLPC clinical cohorts treated with neoadjuvant anti-androgens to improve patient stratification.

35021096	Mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of the cell. Dysfunction of mitochondria homeostasis induces the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR(mt)), altering cellular metabolism. How cells sense the UPR(mt) to rewire metabolism is largely unknown. Here, we show that inactivation of either the citric/tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes aco-2 or idha-1, which encode aconitase and isocitrate dehydrogenase respectively, leads to citrate accumulation. In Caenorhabditis elegans, both in vitro and in vivo, citrate accumulation consequently triggers the UPR(mt) and also promotes lipid accumulation. The transcription factor DVE-1 binds to the promoter of the nuclear hormone receptor nhr-80 to transactivate its expression. NHR-80 then upregulates lipogenesis and lipid accumulation, shifting excess citrate for use in lipogenesis and for storage as triacylglycerol in lipid droplets. Inactivation of DVE-1 or NHR-80 fully abolishes the citrate-induced lipid accumulation. Therefore, our work uncovers a DVE-1-NHR-80-lipogenesis axis linking the transmission of the mitochondrial stress signal to lipid metabolism.	NHR-80 senses the mitochondrial UPR to rewire citrate metabolism for lipid accumulation in Caenorhabditis elegans.	Cell reports	4.0	1
34758314	"Skeletal muscle atrophy is a debilitating condition that occurs with aging and disease, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Previous work determined that common transcriptional changes occur in muscle during atrophy induced by different stimuli. However, whether this holds true at the proteome level remains largely unexplored. Here, we find that, contrary to this earlier model, distinct atrophic stimuli (corticosteroids, cancer cachexia, and aging) induce largely different mRNA and protein changes during muscle atrophy in mice. Moreover, there is widespread transcriptome-proteome disconnect. Consequently, atrophy markers (atrogenes) identified in earlier microarray-based studies do not emerge from proteomics as generally induced by atrophy. Rather, we identify proteins that are distinctly modulated by different types of atrophy (herein defined as ""atroproteins"") such as the myokine CCN1/Cyr61, which regulates myofiber type switching during sarcopenia. Altogether, these integrated analyses indicate that different catabolic stimuli induce muscle atrophy via largely distinct mechanisms."

34953858	Oxidative stress, inflammation, and aberrant activation of microglia in the retina are commonly observed in ocular pathologies. In glaucoma or age-related macular degeneration, the chronic activation of microglia affects retinal ganglion cells and photoreceptors, respectively, contributing to gradual vision loss. However, the molecular mechanisms that cause activation of microglia in the retina are not fully understood. Here we show that exposure of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells to chronic low-level oxidative stress induces mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-specific damage, and the subsequent translocation of damaged mtDNA to the cytoplasm results in the binding and activation of intracellular DNA receptor Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1). Activation of the mtDNA/ZBP1 pathway triggers the expression of proinflammatory markers in RPE cells. In addition, we show that the enhanced release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing fragments of mtDNA derived from the apical site of RPE cells induces a proinflammatory phenotype of microglia via activation of ZBP1 signaling. Collectively, our report establishes oxidatively damaged mtDNA as an important signaling molecule with ZBP1 as its intracellular receptor in the development of an inflammatory response in the retina. We propose that this novel mtDNA-mediated autocrine and paracrine mechanism for triggering and maintaining inflammation in the retina may play an important role in ocular pathologies. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms identified in this report are potentially suitable therapeutic targets to ameliorate development of ocular pathologies.

34910922	Blockade of the inhibitory checkpoint SIRPalpha-CD47 promotes phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages and is a promising avenue in anti-cancer therapy. Productive phagocytosis is strictly predicated on co-engagement of pro-phagocytic receptors-namely, Fc receptors (FcRs), integrin CD11b, or SLAMF7-by their ligands on cancer cells. Here, we examine whether additional pro-phagocytic receptors could be harnessed to broaden the scope of phagocytosis. Inflammatory stimuli, including multiple cytokines and Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, augment phagocytosis efficiency and fully alleviate the requirement of FcRs, CD11b, and SLAMF7 for phagocytosis. These effects are mediated by the unconventional pro-phagocytic integrins CD11a and CD11c, which act with CD18 to initiate actin polarization, leading to phagocytosis. Some inflammatory stimuli enable phagocytosis even in the absence of SIRPalpha-CD47 blockade. Higher CD11c expression in macrophage-enriched tumors correlates with improved survival in clinical studies. Thus, inflammatory macrophages exploit unconventional pro-phagocytic integrins for improved phagocytosis and anti-tumor immunity.

34645979	Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the second most deadly cancer worldwide. Therapies that take advantage of DNA repair defects have been explored in various tumors but not yet systematically in CRC. Here, we found that Diphosphoinositol Pentakisphosphate Kinase 2 (PPIP5K2), an inositol pyrophosphate kinase, was highly expressed in CRC and associated with a poor prognosis of CRC patients. In vitro and in vivo functional studies demonstrated that PPIP5K2 could promote the proliferation and migration ability of CRC cells independent of its inositol pyrophosphate kinase activity. Mechanically, S1006 dephosphorylation of PPIP5K2 could accelerate its dissociation with 14-3-3 in the cytoplasm, resulting in more nuclear distribution. Moreover, DNA damage treatments such as doxorubicin (DOX) or irradiation (IR) could induce nuclear translocation of PPIP5K2, which subsequently promoted homologous recombination (HR) repair by binding and recruiting RPA70 to the DNA damage site as a novel scaffold protein. Importantly, we verified that S1006 dephosphorylation of PPIP5K2 could significantly enhance the DNA repair ability of CRC cells through a series of DNA repair phenotype assays. In conclusion, PPIP5K2 is critical for enhancing the survival of CRC cells via facilitating DNA HR repair. Our findings revealed an unrecognized biological function and mechanism model of PPIP5K2 dependent on S1006 phosphorylation and provided a potential therapeutic target for CRC patients.

34433028	The bacterial DNA gyrase complex (GyrA/GyrB) plays a crucial role during DNA replication and serves as a target for multiple antibiotics, including the fluoroquinolones. Despite it being a valuable antibiotics target, resistance emergence by pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa are proving problematic. Here, we describe Igy, a peptide inhibitor of gyrase, encoded by Pseudomonas bacteriophage LUZ24 and other members of the Bruynoghevirus genus. Igy (5.6 kDa) inhibits in vitro gyrase activity and interacts with the P. aeruginosa GyrB subunit, possibly by DNA mimicry, as indicated by a de novo model of the peptide and mutagenesis. In vivo, overproduction of Igy blocks DNA replication and leads to cell death also in fluoroquinolone-resistant bacterial isolates. These data highlight the potential of discovering phage-inspired leads for antibiotics development, supported by co-evolution, as Igy may serve as a scaffold for small molecule mimicry to target the DNA gyrase complex, without cross-resistance to existing molecules.

34547290	Marine algae catalyze half of all global photosynthetic production of carbohydrates. Owing to their fast growth rates, Ulva spp. rapidly produce substantial amounts of carbohydrate-rich biomass and represent an emerging renewable energy and carbon resource. Their major cell wall polysaccharide is the anionic carbohydrate ulvan. Here, we describe a new enzymatic degradation pathway of the marine bacterium Formosa agariphila for ulvan oligosaccharides involving unsaturated uronic acid at the nonreducing end linked to rhamnose-3-sulfate and glucuronic or iduronic acid (Delta-Rha3S-GlcA/IdoA-Rha3S). Notably, we discovered a new dehydratase (P29_PDnc) acting on the nonreducing end of ulvan oligosaccharides, i.e., GlcA/IdoA-Rha3S, forming the aforementioned unsaturated uronic acid residue. This residue represents the substrate for GH105 glycoside hydrolases, which complements the enzymatic degradation pathway including one ulvan lyase, one multimodular sulfatase, three glycoside hydrolases, and the dehydratase P29_PDnc, the latter being described for the first time. Our research thus shows that the oligosaccharide dehydratase is involved in the degradation of carboxylated polysaccharides into monosaccharides.

34703030	Intratumoral heterogeneity has been described for various tumor types and models of human cancer, and can have profound effects on tumor progression and drug resistance. This study describes an in-depth analysis of molecular and functional heterogeneity among subclonal populations (SCPs) derived from a single triple-negative breast cancer cell line, including copy number analysis, whole-exome and RNA sequencing, proteome analysis, and barcode analysis of clonal dynamics, as well as functional assays. The SCPs were found to have multiple unique genetic alterations and displayed significant variation in anchorage independent growth and tumor forming ability. Analyses of clonal dynamics in SCP mixtures using DNA barcode technology revealed selection for distinct clonal populations in different in vitro and in vivo environmental contexts, demonstrating that in vitro propagation of cancer cell lines using different culture conditions can contribute to the establishment of unique strains. These analyses also revealed strong enrichment of a single SCP during the development of xenograft tumors in immune-compromised mice. This SCP displayed attenuated interferon signaling in vivo and reduced sensitivity to the antiproliferative effects of type I interferons. Reduction in interferon signaling was found to provide a selective advantage within the xenograft microenvironment specifically. In concordance with the previously described role of interferon signaling as tumor suppressor, these findings suggest that similar selective pressures may be operative in human cancer and patient-derived xenograft models.

34599965	Amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition in the neocortex is a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the extent of deposition does not readily explain phenotypic diversity and rate of disease progression. The prion strain-like model of disease heterogeneity suggests the existence of different conformers of Abeta. We explored this paradigm using conformation-dependent immunoassay (CDI) for Abeta and conformation-sensitive luminescent conjugated oligothiophenes (LCOs) in AD cases with variable progression rates. Mapping the Abeta conformations in the frontal, occipital, and temporal regions in 20 AD patients with CDI revealed extensive interindividual and anatomical diversity in the structural organization of Abeta with the most significant differences in the temporal cortex of rapidly progressive AD. The fluorescence emission spectra collected in situ from Abeta plaques in the same regions demonstrated considerable diversity of spectral characteristics of two LCOs-quatroformylthiophene acetic acid and heptaformylthiophene acetic acid. Heptaformylthiophene acetic acid detected a wider range of Abeta deposits, and both LCOs revealed distinct spectral attributes of diffuse and cored plaques in the temporal cortex of rapidly and slowly progressive AD and less frequent and discernible differences in the frontal and occipital cortex. These and CDI findings indicate a major conformational diversity of Abeta accumulating in the neocortex, with the most notable differences in temporal cortex of cases with shorter disease duration, and implicate distinct Abeta conformers (strains) in the rapid progression of AD.

34758309	Swallowing is an essential step of eating and drinking. However, how the quality of a food bolus is sensed by pharyngeal neurons is largely unknown. Here we find that mechanical receptors along the Drosophila pharynx are required for control of meal size, especially for food of high viscosity. The mechanical force exerted by the bolus passing across the pharynx is detected by neurons expressing the mechanotransduction channel NOMPC (no mechanoreceptor potential C) and is relayed, together with gustatory information, to IN1 neurons in the subesophageal zone (SEZ) of the brain. IN1 (ingestion neurons) neurons act directly upstream of a group of peptidergic neurons that encode satiety. Prolonged activation of IN1 neurons suppresses feeding. IN1 neurons receive inhibition from DSOG1 (descending subesophageal neurons) neurons, a group of GABAergic neurons that non-selectively suppress feeding.

34866320	Mammalian development begins in transcriptional silence followed by a period of widespread activation of thousands of genes. DNA methylation reprogramming is integral to embryogenesis and linked to Tet enzymes, but their function in early development is not well understood. Here, we generate combined deficiencies of all three Tet enzymes in mouse oocytes using a morpholino-guided knockdown approach and study the impact of acute Tet enzyme deficiencies on preimplantation development. Tet1-3 deficient embryos arrest at the 2-cell stage with the most severe phenotype linked to Tet2. Individual Tet enzymes display non-redundant roles in the consecutive oxidation of 5-methylcytosine to 5-carboxylcytosine. Gene expression analysis uncovers that Tet enzymes are required for completion of embryonic genome activation (EGA) and fine-tuned expression of transposable elements and chimeric transcripts. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing reveals minor changes of global DNA methylation in Tet-deficient 2-cell embryos, suggesting an important role of non-catalytic functions of Tet enzymes in early embryogenesis. Our results demonstrate that Tet enzymes are key components of the clock that regulates the timing and extent of EGA in mammalian embryos.

34610316	In the zebrafish embryo, the onset of blood flow generates fluid shear stress on endocardial cells, which are specialized endothelial cells that line the interior of the heart. High levels of fluid shear stress activate both Notch and Klf2 signaling, which play crucial roles in atrioventricular valvulogenesis. However, it remains unclear why only individual endocardial cells ingress into the cardiac jelly and initiate valvulogenesis. Here, we show that lateral inhibition between endocardial cells, mediated by Notch, singles out Delta-like-4-positive endocardial cells. These cells ingress into the cardiac jelly, where they form an abluminal cell population. Delta-like-4-positive cells ingress in response to Wnt9a, which is produced in parallel through an Erk5-Klf2-Wnt9a signaling cascade also activated by blood flow. Hence, mechanical stimulation activates parallel mechanosensitive signaling pathways that produce binary effects by driving endocardial cells toward either luminal or abluminal fates. Ultimately, these cell fate decisions sculpt cardiac valve leaflets.	Mechanosensitive Notch-Dll4 and Klf2-Wnt9 signaling pathways intersect in guiding valvulogenesis in zebrafish.	Cell reports	2.0	0
34847359	Most mitochondrial proteins are translated in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria. Mutations in the mitochondrial protein import machinery cause human pathologies. However, a lack of suitable tools to measure protein uptake across the mitochondrial proteome has prevented the identification of specific proteins affected by import perturbation. Here, we introduce mePROD(mt), a pulsed-SILAC based proteomics approach that includes a booster signal to increase the sensitivity for mitochondrial proteins selectively, enabling global dynamic analysis of endogenous mitochondrial protein uptake in cells. We applied mePROD(mt) to determine protein uptake kinetics and examined how inhibitors of mitochondrial import machineries affect protein uptake. Monitoring changes in translation and uptake upon mitochondrial membrane depolarization revealed that protein uptake was extensively modulated by the import and translation machineries via activation of the integrated stress response. Strikingly, uptake changes were not uniform, with subsets of proteins being unaffected or decreased due to changes in translation or import capacity.

34929171	In HIV, the polyprotein precursor Gag orchestrates the formation of the viral capsid. In the current view of this viral assembly, Gag forms low-order oligomers that bind to the viral genomic RNA triggering the formation of high-ordered ribonucleoprotein complexes. However, this assembly model was established using biochemical or imaging methods that do not describe the cellular location hosting Gag-gRNA complex nor distinguish gRNA packaging in single particles. Here, we studied the intracellular localization of these complexes by electron microscopy and monitored the distances between the two partners by morphometric analysis of gold beads specifically labeling Gag and gRNA. We found that formation of these viral clusters occurred shortly after the nuclear export of the gRNA. During their transport to the plasma membrane, the distance between Gag and gRNA decreases together with an increase of gRNA packaging. Point mutations in the zinc finger patterns of the nucleocapsid domain of Gag caused an increase in the distance between Gag and gRNA as well as a sharp decrease of gRNA packaged into virions. Finally, we show that removal of stem loop 1 of the 5'-untranslated region does not interfere with gRNA packaging, whereas combined with the removal of stem loop 3 is sufficient to decrease but not abolish Gag-gRNA cluster formation and gRNA packaging. In conclusion, this morphometric analysis of Gag-gRNA cluster formation sheds new light on HIV-1 assembly that can be used to describe at nanoscale resolution other viral assembly steps involving RNA or protein-protein interactions.

34788610	To reshape neuronal connectivity in adult stages, Drosophila sensory neurons prune their dendrites during metamorphosis using a genetic degeneration program that is induced by the steroid hormone ecdysone. Metamorphosis is a nonfeeding stage that imposes metabolic constraints on development. We find that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a regulator of energy homeostasis, is cell-autonomously required for dendrite pruning. AMPK is activated by ecdysone and promotes oxidative phosphorylation and pyruvate usage, likely to enable neurons to use noncarbohydrate metabolites such as amino acids for energy production. Loss of AMPK or mitochondrial deficiency causes specific defects in pruning factor translation and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Our findings distinguish pruning from pathological neurite degeneration, which is often induced by defects in energy production, and highlight how metabolism is adapted to fit energy-costly developmental transitions.

34942119	Neurodevelopmental cognitive disorders provide insights into mechanisms of human brain development. Here, we report an intellectual disability syndrome caused by the loss of APC7, a core component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase promoting complex (APC). In mechanistic studies, we uncover a critical role for APC7 during the recruitment and ubiquitination of APC substrates. In proteomics analyses of the brain from mice harboring the patient-specific APC7 mutation, we identify the chromatin-associated protein Ki-67 as an APC7-dependent substrate of the APC in neurons. Conditional knockout of the APC coactivator protein Cdh1, but not Cdc20, leads to the accumulation of Ki-67 protein in neurons in vivo, suggesting that APC7 is required for the function of Cdh1-APC in the brain. Deregulated neuronal Ki-67 upon APC7 loss localizes predominantly to constitutive heterochromatin. Our findings define an essential function for APC7 and Cdh1-APC in neuronal heterochromatin regulation, with implications for understanding human brain development and disease.

35021084	ATRX, a chromatin remodeler protein, is recurrently mutated in H3F3A-mutant pediatric glioblastoma (GBM) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant grade 2/3 adult glioma. Previous work has shown that ATRX-deficient GBM cells show enhanced sensitivity to irradiation, but the etiology remains unclear. We find that ATRX binds the regulatory elements of cell-cycle phase transition genes in GBM cells, and there is a marked reduction in Checkpoint Kinase 1 (CHEK1) expression with ATRX loss, leading to the early release of G2/M entry after irradiation. ATRX-deficient cells exhibit enhanced activation of master cell-cycle regulator ATM with irradiation. Addition of the ATM inhibitor AZD0156 doubles median survival in mice intracranially implanted with ATRX-deficient GBM cells, which is not seen in ATRX-wild-type controls. This study demonstrates that ATRX-deficient high-grade gliomas (HGGs) display Chk1-mediated dysregulation of cell-cycle phase transitions, which opens a window for therapies targeting this phenotype.

34986345	Candida albicans is both a commensal and an opportunistic fungal pathogen. Invading hyphae of C. albicans secrete candidalysin, a pore-forming peptide toxin. To prevent cell death, epithelial cells must protect themselves from direct damage induced by candidalysin and by the mechanical forces exerted by expanding hyphae. We identify two key Ca(2+)-dependent repair mechanisms employed by epithelial cells to withstand candidalysin-producing hyphae. Using camelid nanobodies, we demonstrate candidalysin secretion directly into the invasion pockets induced by elongating C. albicans hyphae. The toxin induces oscillatory increases in cytosolic [Ca(2+)], which cause hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and loss of cortical actin. Epithelial cells dispose of damaged membrane regions containing candidalysin by an Alg-2/Alix/ESCRT-III-dependent blebbing process. At later stages, plasmalemmal tears induced mechanically by invading hyphae are repaired by exocytic insertion of lysosomal membranes. These two repair mechanisms maintain epithelial integrity and prevent mucosal damage during both commensal growth and infection by C. albicans.

34866316	Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) can self-renew indefinitely and maintain pluripotency. Inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) by the kinase inhibitor INK128 is known to induce paused pluripotency in mESCs cultured with traditional serum/LIF medium (SL), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) but not complex 2 (mTORC2) mediates mTOR inhibition-induced paused pluripotency in cells grown in both SL and 2iL medium (GSK3 and MEK inhibitors and LIF). We also show that mTORC1 regulates self-renewal in both conditions mainly through eIF4F-mediated translation initiation that targets mRNAs of both cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosome subunits. Moreover, inhibition of mitochondrial translation is sufficient to induce paused pluripotency. Interestingly, eIF4F also regulates maintenance of pluripotency in an mTORC1-independent but MEK/ERK-dependent manner in SL, indicating that translation of pluripotency genes is controlled differently in SL and 2iL. Our study reveals a detailed picture of how mTOR governs self-renewal in mESCs and uncovers a context-dependent function of eIF4F in pluripotency regulation.

34864058	Interleukin (IL)-22 is a cytokine that plays a critical role in intestinal epithelial homeostasis. Its downstream functions are mediated through interaction with the heterodimeric IL-22 receptor and subsequent activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). IL-22 signaling can induce transcription of genes necessary for intestinal epithelial cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, tight junction fortification, and antimicrobial production. Recent studies have also implicated IL-22 signaling in the regulation of intestinal epithelial fucosylation in mice. However, whether IL-22 regulates intestinal fucosylation in human intestinal epithelial cells and the molecular mechanisms that govern this process are unknown. Here, in experiments performed in human cell lines and human-derived enteroids, we show that IL-22 signaling regulates expression of the B3GNT7 transcript, which encodes a beta1-3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase that can participate in the synthesis of poly-N-acetyllactosamine (polyLacNAc) chains. Additionally, we find that IL-22 signaling regulates levels of the alpha1-3-fucosylated Lewis X (Le(x)) blood group antigen, and that this glycan epitope is primarily displayed on O-glycosylated intestinal epithelial glycoproteins. Moreover, we show that increased expression of B3GNT7 alone is sufficient to promote increased display of Le(x)-decorated carbohydrate glycan structures primarily on O-glycosylated intestinal epithelial glycoproteins. Together, these data identify B3GNT7 as an intermediary in IL-22-dependent induction of fucosylation of glycoproteins and uncover a novel role for B3GNT7 in intestinal glycosylation.

34965428	Non-neuronal responses in neurodegenerative disease have received increasing attention as important contributors to disease pathogenesis and progression. Here we utilize single-cell RNA sequencing to broadly profile 13 cell types in three different mouse models of Alzheimer disease (AD), capturing the effects of tau-only, amyloid-only, or combined tau-amyloid pathology. We highlight microglia, oligodendrocyte, astrocyte, and T cell responses and compare them across these models. Notably, we identify two distinct transcriptional states for oligodendrocytes emerging differentially across disease models, and we determine their spatial distribution. Furthermore, we explore the impact of Trem2 deletion in the context of combined pathology. Trem2 knockout mice exhibit severely blunted microglial responses to combined tau and amyloid pathology, but responses from non-microglial cell types (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and T cells) are relatively unchanged. These results delineate core transcriptional states that are engaged in response to AD pathology, and how they are influenced by a key AD risk gene, Trem2.

34975151	Pancreatic cancer is regarded as the most lethal solid tumor worldwide. Deregulated and constitutively activated NF-kappaB signaling is one of the major characteristics of pancreatic cancer. The total expression level and subcellular localization of RelA/p65 have been shown to determine the activation of canonical NF-kappaB signaling in pancreatic cancer. FGD3, which is involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and cell shape, has been reported to inhibit cancer cell migration and predict a favorable prognosis in multiple types of cancer. However, the specific role of FGD3 in pancreatic cancer is still unknown. In this study, we conducted a systematic investigation of the cancer-related role of FGD3 in pancreatic cancer. We demonstrated that FGD3 was abnormally downregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and that low expression of FGD3 was associated with unfavorable prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancer. Then, we showed that FGD3 inhibited pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, we revealed that FGD3 silencing activated the NF-kappaB signaling pathway by promoting HSF4 nuclear translocation and increasing p65 expression in pancreatic cancer cells. Therefore, our results identified a novel and targetable FGD3/HSF4/p65 signaling axis in pancreatic cancer cells.

35133866	Pannexin (PANX) family proteins form large-pore channels that mediate purinergic signaling. We analyzed the cryo-EM structures of human PANX1 in lipid nanodiscs to elucidate the gating mechanism and its regulation by the amino terminus in phospholipids. The wild-type channel has an amino-terminal funnel in the pore, but in the presence of the inhibitor probenecid, a cytoplasmically oriented amino terminus and phospholipids obstruct the pore. Functional analysis using whole-cell patch-clamp and oocyte voltage clamp showed that PANX1 lacking the amino terminus did not open and had a dominant negative effect on channel activity, thus confirming that the amino-terminal domain played an essential role in channel opening. These observations suggest that dynamic conformational changes in the amino terminus of human PANX1 are associated with lipid movement in and out of the pore. Moreover, the data provide insight into the gating mechanism of PANX1 and, more broadly, other large-pore channels.

34478710	The seasonal nature of outbreaks of respiratory viral infections with increased transmission during low temperatures has been well established. Accordingly, temperature has been suggested to play a role on the viability and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the Spike glycoprotein is known to bind to its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to initiate viral fusion. Using biochemical, biophysical, and functional assays to dissect the effect of temperature on the receptor-Spike interaction, we observed a significant and stepwise increase in RBD-ACE2 affinity at low temperatures, resulting in slower dissociation kinetics. This translated into enhanced interaction of the full Spike glycoprotein with the ACE2 receptor and higher viral attachment at low temperatures. Interestingly, the RBD N501Y mutation, present in emerging variants of concern (VOCs) that are fueling the pandemic worldwide (including the B.1.1.7 (alpha) lineage), bypassed this requirement. This data suggests that the acquisition of N501Y reflects an adaptation to warmer climates, a hypothesis that remains to be tested.

34644584	RAG1 and RAG2 form a tetramer nuclease to initiate V(D)J recombination in developing T and B lymphocytes. The RAG1 protein evolves from a transposon ancestor and possesses nuclease activity that requires interaction with RAG2. Here, we show that the human RAG1 aggregates in the nucleus in the absence of RAG2, exhibiting an extremely low V(D)J recombination activity. In contrast, RAG2 does not aggregate by itself, but it interacts with RAG1 to disrupt RAG1 aggregates and thereby activate robust V(D)J recombination. Moreover, RAG2 from mouse and zebrafish could not disrupt the aggregation of human RAG1 as efficiently as human RAG2 did, indicating a species-specific regulatory mechanism for RAG1 by RAG2. Therefore, we propose that RAG2 coevolves with RAG1 to release inert RAG1 from aggregates and thereby activate V(D)J recombination to generate diverse antigen receptors in lymphocytes.	RAG2 abolishes RAG1 aggregation to facilitate V(D)J recombination.	Cell reports	0.0	0
34496253	The evolutionary strategy of transferring maternal antibodies via milk profoundly impacts the survival, lifelong health, and wellbeing of all neonates, including a pronounced impact on human breastfeeding success and infant development. While there has been increased recognition that interorgan connectivity influences the quality of a mother's milk, potentially to personalize it for her offspring, the underlying bases for these processes are incompletely resolved. Here, we define an essential role of Peyer's patches (PPs) for the generation of plasma cells that secrete maternal immunoglobulin A (IgA) into milk. Our metagenomic analysis reveals that the presence of certain residential microorganisms in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, such as Bacteroides acidifaciens and Prevotella buccalis, is indispensable for the programming of maternal IgA synthesis prior to lactational transfer. Our data provide important insights into how the microbiome of the maternal GI environment, specifically through PPs, can be communicated to the next generation via milk.

34758356	Juvenile hormone (JH) plays vital roles in insect reproduction, development, and in many aspects of physiology. JH primarily acts at the gene-regulatory level through interaction with an intracellular receptor (JH receptor [JHR]), a ligand-activated complex of transcription factors consisting of the JH-binding protein methoprene-tolerant (MET) and its partner taiman (TAI). Initial studies indicated significance of post-transcriptional phosphorylation, subunit assembly, and nucleocytoplasmic transport of JHR in JH signaling. However, our knowledge of JHR regulation at the protein level remains rudimentary, partly because of the difficulty of obtaining purified and functional JHR proteins. Here, we present a method for high-yield expression and purification of JHR complexes from two insect species, the beetle T. castaneum and the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Recombinant JHR subunits from each species were coexpressed in an insect cell line using a baculovirus system. MET-TAI complexes were purified through affinity chromatography and anion exchange columns to yield proteins capable of binding both the hormonal ligand (JH III) and DNA bearing cognate JH-response elements. We further examined the beetle JHR complex in greater detail. Biochemical analyses and MS confirmed that T. castaneum JHR was a 1:1 heterodimer consisting of MET and Taiman proteins, stabilized by the JHR agonist ligand methoprene. Phosphoproteomics uncovered multiple phosphorylation sites in the MET protein, some of which were induced by methoprene treatment. Finally, we report a functional bipartite nuclear localization signal, straddled by phosphorylated residues, within the disordered C-terminal region of MET. Our present characterization of the recombinant JHR is an initial step toward understanding JHR structure and function.

34523214	Cardiac regeneration occurs primarily through proliferation of existing cardiomyocytes, but also involves complex interactions between distinct cardiac cell types including non-cardiomyocytes (non-CMs). However, the subpopulations, distinguishing molecular features, cellular functions, and intercellular interactions of non-CMs in heart regeneration remain largely unexplored. Using the LIGER algorithm, we assemble an atlas of cell states from 61,977 individual non-CM scRNA-seq profiles isolated at multiple time points during regeneration. This analysis reveals extensive non-CM cell diversity, including multiple macrophage (MC), fibroblast (FB), and endothelial cell (EC) subpopulations with unique spatiotemporal distributions, and suggests an important role for MC in inducing the activated FB and EC subpopulations. Indeed, pharmacological perturbation of MC function compromises the induction of the unique FB and EC subpopulations. Furthermore, we developed computational algorithm Topologizer to map the topological relationships and dynamic transitions between functional states. We uncover dynamic transitions between MC functional states and identify factors involved in mRNA processing and transcriptional regulation associated with the transition. Together, our single-cell transcriptomic analysis of non-CMs during cardiac regeneration provides a blueprint for interrogating the molecular and cellular basis of this process.	Functional coordination of non-myocytes plays a key role in adult zebrafish heart regeneration.	EMBO reports	0.0	0
34433091	Within the extensive range of self-propagating pathologic protein aggregates of mammals, prions are the most clearly infectious (e.g., approximately 10(9) lethal doses per milligram). The structures of such lethal assemblies of PrP molecules have been poorly understood. Here we report a near-atomic core structure of a brain-derived, fully infectious prion (263K strain). Cryo-electron microscopy showed amyloid fibrils assembled with parallel in-register intermolecular beta sheets. Each monomer provides one rung of the ordered fibril core, with N-linked glycans and glycolipid anchors projecting outward. Thus, single monomers form the templating surface for incoming monomers at fibril ends, where prion growth occurs. Comparison to another prion strain (aRML) revealed major differences in fibril morphology but, like 263K, an asymmetric fibril cross-section without paired protofilaments. These findings provide structural insights into prion propagation, strains, species barriers, and membrane pathogenesis. This structure also helps frame considerations of factors influencing the relative transmissibility of other pathologic amyloids.

34936867	Writing and erasing of posttranslational modifications are crucial to phenotypic plasticity and antigenic variation of eukaryotic pathogens. Targeting pathogens' modification machineries, thus, represents a valid approach to fighting parasitic diseases. However, identification of parasitic targets and the development of selective anti-parasitic drugs still represent major bottlenecks. Here, we show that the zinc-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs) of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi are key regulators that have significantly diverged from their human counterparts. Depletion of T. cruzi class I HDACs tcDAC1 and tcDAC2 compromises cell-cycle progression and division, leading to cell death. Notably, tcDAC2 displays a deacetylase activity essential to the parasite and shows major structural differences with human HDACs. Specifically, tcDAC2 harbors a modular active site with a unique subpocket targeted by inhibitors showing substantial anti-parasitic effects in cellulo and in vivo. Thus, the targeting of the many atypical HDACs in pathogens can enable anti-parasitic selective chemical impairment.

35067686	New strategies are needed to predict and overcome metastatic progression and therapy resistance in prostate cancer. One potential clinical target is the stem cell transcription factor SOX2, which has a critical role in prostate development and cancer. We thus investigated the impact of SOX2 expression on patient outcomes and its function within prostate cancer cells. Analyses of SOX2 expression among a case-control cohort of 1028 annotated tumor specimens demonstrated that SOX2 expression confers a more rapid time to metastasis and decreased patient survival after biochemical recurrence. SOX2 ChIP-Seq analyses revealed SOX2-binding sites within prostate cancer cells which differ significantly from canonical embryonic SOX2 gene targets, and prostate-specific SOX2 gene targets are associated with multiple oncogenic pathways. Interestingly, phenotypic and gene expression analyses after CRISPR-mediated deletion of SOX2 in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells, as well as ectopic SOX2 expression in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells, demonstrated that SOX2 promotes changes in multiple metabolic pathways and metabolites. SOX2 expression in prostate cancer cell lines confers increased glycolysis and glycolytic capacity, as well as increased basal and maximal oxidative respiration and increased spare respiratory capacity. Further, SOX2 expression was associated with increased quantities of mitochondria, and metabolomic analyses revealed SOX2-associated changes in the metabolism of purines, pyrimidines, amino acids and sugars, and the pentose phosphate pathway. Analyses of SOX2 gene targets with central functions metabolism (CERK, ECHS1, HS6SDT1, LPCAT4, PFKP, SLC16A3, SLC46A1, and TST) document significant expression correlation with SOX2 among RNA-Seq datasets derived from patient tumors and metastases. These data support a key role for SOX2 in metabolic reprogramming of prostate cancer cells and reveal new mechanisms to understand how SOX2 enables metastatic progression, lineage plasticity, and therapy resistance. Further, our data suggest clinical opportunities to exploit SOX2 as a biomarker for staging and imaging, as well as a potential pharmacologic target.

34499925	Mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake tailors the strength of stimulation of plasma membrane phospholipase C-coupled receptors to that of cellular bioenergetics. However, how Ca(2+) uptake by the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter (MCU) shapes receptor-evoked interorganellar Ca(2+) signaling is unknown. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockout, subcellular Ca(2+) imaging, and mathematical modeling to show that MCU is a universal regulator of intracellular Ca(2+) signaling across mammalian cell types. MCU activity sustains cytosolic Ca(2+) signaling by preventing Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of store-operated Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) channels and by inhibiting Ca(2+) extrusion. Paradoxically, MCU knockout (MCU-KO) enhanced cytosolic Ca(2+) responses to store depletion. Physiological agonist stimulation in MCU-KO cells led to enhanced frequency of cytosolic Ca(2+) oscillations, endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) refilling, nuclear translocation of nuclear factor for activated T cells transcription factors, and cell proliferation, without altering inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor activity. Our data show that MCU has dual counterbalancing functions at the cytosol-mitochondria interface, whereby the cell-specific MCU-dependent cytosolic Ca(2+) clearance and buffering capacity of mitochondria reciprocally regulate interorganellar Ca(2+) transfer and nuclear factor for activated T cells nuclear translocation during receptor-evoked signaling. These findings highlight the critical dual function of the MCU not only in the acute Ca(2+) buffering by mitochondria but also in shaping endoplasmic reticulum and cytosolic Ca(2+) signals that regulate cellular transcription and function.

34774796	Quantitative flux maps describing glycerolipid synthesis can be important tools for rational engineering of lipid content and composition in oilseeds. Lipid accumulation in cultured embryos of Camelina sativa is known to mimic that of seeds in terms of rate of lipid synthesis and composition. To assess the kinetic complexity of the glycerolipid flux network, cultured embryos were incubated with [(14)C/(13)C]glycerol, and initial and steady state rates of [(14)C/(13)Cglyceryl] lipid accumulation were measured. At steady state, the linear accumulations of labeled lipid classes matched those expected from mass compositions. The system showed an apparently simple kinetic precursor-product relationship between the intermediate pool, dominated by diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), and the triacylglycerol (TAG) product. We also conducted isotopomer analyses on hydrogenated lipid class species. [(13)C3glyceryl] labeling of DAG and PC, together with estimates of endogenous [(12)C3glyceryl] dilution, showed that each biosynthetically active lipid pool is approximately 30% of the total by moles. This validates the concept that lipid sub-pools can describe lipid biosynthetic networks. By tracking the kinetics of [(13)C3glyceryl] and [(13)C2acyl] labeling, we observed two distinct TAG synthesis components. The major TAG synthesis flux ( approximately 75%) was associated with >95% of the DAG/PC intermediate pool, with little glycerol being metabolized to fatty acids, and with little dilution from endogenous glycerol; a smaller flux exhibited converse characteristics. This kinetic heterogeneity was further explored using postlabeling embryo dissection and differential lipid extractions. The minor flux was tentatively localized to surface cells across the whole embryo. Such heterogeneity must be recognized in order to construct accurate gene expression patterns and metabolic networks describing lipid biosynthesis in developing embryos.	Kinetic complexities of triacylglycerol accumulation in developing embryos from Camelina sativa provide evidence for multiple biosynthetic systems.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0.0	0
34666041	Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is expressed in the liver and secreted as biliary glycoprotein 1 (BGP1) via bile canaliculi (BCs). CEACAM1-LF is a 72 amino acid cytoplasmic domain mRNA splice isoform with two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). Ceacam1(-/-) or Ser503Ala transgenic mice have been shown to develop insulin resistance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; however, the role of the human equivalent residue, Ser508, in lipid dysregulation is unknown. Human HepG2 hepatocytes that express CEACAM1 and form BC in vitro were compared with CEACAM1(-/-) cells and CEACAM1(-/-) cells expressing Ser508Ala null or Ser508Asp phosphorylation mimic mutations or to phosphorylation null mutations in the tyrosine ITIMs known to be phosphorylated by the tyrosine kinase Src. CEACAM1(-/-) cells and the Ser508Asp and Tyr520Phe mutants strongly retained lipids, while Ser508Ala and Tyr493Phe mutants had low lipid levels compared with wild-type cells, indicating that the ITIM mutants phenocopied the Ser508 mutants. We found that the fatty acid transporter CD36 was upregulated in the S508A mutant, coexpressed in BCs with CEACAM1, co-IPed with CEACAM1 and Src, and when downregulated via RNAi, an increase in lipid droplet content was observed. Nuclear translocation of CD36 associated kinase LKB1 was increased sevenfold in the S508A mutant versus CEACAM1(-/-) cells and correlated with increased activation of CD36-associated kinase AMPK in CEACAM1(-/-) cells. Thus, while CEACAM1(-/-) HepG2 cells upregulate lipid storage similar to Ceacam1(-/-) in murine liver, the null mutation Ser508Ala led to decreased lipid storage, emphasizing evolutionary changes between the CEACAM1 genes in mouse and humans.	Human CEACAM1-LF regulates lipid storage in HepG2 cells via fatty acid transporter CD36.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0.0	0
34852226	CD19-CAR T cell therapy has evolved into the standard of care for relapsed/refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); however, limited persistence of the CAR T cells enables tumor relapse for many patients. To gain a deeper understanding of the molecular characteristics associated with CAR T cell differentiation, we performed longitudinal genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of CD8(+) CD19-CAR T cells post-infusion in ALL patients. We report that CAR T cells undergo a rapid and broad erasure of repressive DNA methylation reprograms at effector-associated genes. The CAR T cell post-infusion changes are further characterized by repression of genes (e.g., TCF7 and LEF1) associated with memory potential and a DNA methylation signature (e.g., demethylation at CX3CR1, BATF, and TOX) demarcating a transition toward exhaustion-progenitor T cells. Thus, CD19-CAR T cells undergo exhaustion-associated DNA methylation programming, indicating that efforts to prevent this process may be an attractive approach to improve CAR T cell efficacy.

34864055	Respiratory silicosis is a preventable occupational disease that develops secondary to the aspiration of crystalline silicon dioxide (silica) into the lungs, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and IL-1beta production. Cathepsin Z has been associated with the development of inflammation and IL-1beta production; however, the mechanism of how cathepsin Z leads to IL-1beta production is unknown. Here, the requirement for cathepsin Z in silicosis was determined using WT mice and mice deficient in cathepsin Z. The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages was studied using WT and cathepsin Z-deficient bone marrow-derived murine dendritic cells and the human monocytic cell line THP-1. The cells were activated with silica, and IL-1beta release was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or IL-1beta bioassays. The relative contribution of the active domain or integrin-binding domain of cathepsin Z was studied using recombinant cathepsin Z constructs and the alpha5 integrin neutralizing antibody. We report that the lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin Z potentiates the development of inflammation associated with respiratory silicosis by augmenting NLRP3 inflammasome-derived IL-1beta expression in response to silica. The secreted cathepsin Z functions nonproteolytically via the internal integrin-binding domain to impact caspase-1 activation and the production of active IL-1beta through integrin alpha5 without affecting the transcription levels of NLRP3 inflammasome components. This work reveals a regulatory pathway for the NLRP3 inflammasome that occurs in an outside-in fashion and provides a link between extracellular cathepsin Z and inflammation. Furthermore, it reveals a level of NLRP3 inflammasome regulation that has previously only been found downstream of extracellular pathogens.

34801552	Insulin resistance impairs postprandial glucose uptake through glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and is the primary defect preceding type 2 diabetes. We previously generated an insulin-resistant mouse model with human GLUT4 promoter-driven insulin receptor knockout (GIRKO) in the muscle, adipose, and neuronal subpopulations. However, the rate of diabetes in GIRKO mice remained low prior to 6 months of age on normal chow diet (NCD), suggesting that additional factors/mechanisms are responsible for adverse metabolic effects driving the ultimate progression of overt diabetes. In this study, we characterized the metabolic phenotypes of the adult GIRKO mice acutely switched to high-fat diet (HFD) feeding in order to identify additional metabolic challenges required for disease progression. Distinct from other diet-induced obesity (DIO) and genetic models (e.g., db/db mice), GIRKO mice remained leaner on HFD feeding, but developed other cardinal features of insulin resistance syndrome. GIRKO mice rapidly developed hyperglycemia despite compensatory increases in beta-cell mass and hyperinsulinemia. Furthermore, GIRKO mice also had impaired oral glucose tolerance and a limited glucose-lowering benefit from exendin-4, suggesting that the blunted incretin effect contributed to hyperglycemia. Secondly, GIRKO mice manifested severe dyslipidemia while on HFD due to elevated hepatic lipid secretion, serum triglyceride concentration, and lipid droplet accumulation in hepatocytes. Thirdly, GIRKO mice on HFD had increased inflammatory cues in the gut, which were associated with the HFD-induced microbiome alterations and increased serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In conclusion, our studies identified important gene/diet interactions contributing to diabetes progression, which might be leveraged to develop more efficacious therapies.

34788612	Chronic injury to hepatocytes results in inflammation, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The tetraspanin TM4SF5 is implicated in fibrosis and cancer. We investigate the role of TM4SF5 in communication between hepatocytes and macrophages (MPhis) and its possible influence on the inflammatory microenvironment that may lead to NAFLD. TM4SF5 induction in differentiated MPhis promotes glucose uptake, glycolysis, and glucose sensitivity, leading to M1-type MPhi activation. Activated M1-type MPhis secrete pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL-6), which induces the secretion of CCL20 and CXCL10 from TM4SF5-positive hepatocytes. Although TM4SF5-dependent secretion of these chemokines enhances glycolysis in M0 MPhis, further chronic exposure reprograms MPhis for an increase in the proportion of M2-type MPhis in the population, which may support diet- and chemical-induced NAFLD progression. We suggest that TM4SF5 expression in MPhis and hepatocytes is critically involved in modulating the inflammatory environment during NAFLD progression.

34838590	Post-translationally modified tau is the primary component of tau neurofibrillary tangles, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) within the tau microtubule (MT)-binding domain (MBD), which encompasses two hexapeptide motifs that act as critical nucleating regions for tau aggregation, can potentially modulate tau aggregation as well as interactions with MTs and membranes. Here, we characterize the effects of a recently discovered tau PTM, lysine succinylation, on tau-tubulin interactions and compare these to the effects of two previously reported MBD modifications, lysine acetylation and tyrosine phosphorylation. As generation of site-specific PTMs in proteins is challenging, we used short synthetic peptides to quantify the effects on tubulin binding of three site-specific PTMs located within the PHF6( *) (paired helical filament [PHF] residues 275-280) and PHF6 (residues 306-311) hexapeptide motifs: K280 acetylation, Y310 phosphorylation, and K311 succinylation. We compared these effects to those observed for MBD PTM-mimetic point mutations K280Q, Y310E, and K311E. Finally, we evaluated the effects of these PTM-mimetic mutations on MBD membrane binding and membrane-induced fibril and oligomer formation. We found that all three PTMs perturb tau MT binding, with Y310 phosphorylation exerting the strongest effect. PTM-mimetic mutations partially recapitulated the effects of the PTMs on MT binding and also disrupted tau membrane binding and membrane-induced oligomer and fibril formation. These results imply that these PTMs, including the novel and Alzheimer's disease-specific succinylation of tau K311, may influence both the physiological and pathological interactions of tau and thus represent targets for therapeutic intervention.

35132225	Epigenetic inheritance describes the transmission of gene regulatory information across generations without altering DNA sequences, enabling offspring to adapt to environmental conditions. Small RNAs have been implicated in this, through both the oocyte and the sperm. However, as much of the cellular content is extruded during spermatogenesis, it is unclear whether cytoplasmic small RNAs can contribute to epigenetic inheritance through sperm. Here we identify a sperm-specific germ granule, termed the paternal epigenetic inheritance (PEI) granule, that mediates paternal epigenetic inheritance by retaining the cytoplasmic Argonaute protein WAGO-3 during spermatogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans. We identify the PEI granule proteins PEI-1 and PEI-2, which have distinct functions in this process: granule formation, Argonaute selectivity and subcellular localization.

34520722	Chromatin fibers must fold or coil in the process of chromosome condensation. Patterns of coiling have been demonstrated for reconstituted chromatin, but the actual trajectories of fibers in condensed states of chromosomes could not be visualized because of the high density of the material. We have exploited partial decondensation of mitotic chromosomes to reveal their internal structure at sub-nucleosomal resolution by cryo-electron tomography, without the use of stains, fixatives, milling, or sectioning. DNA gyres around nucleosomes were visible, allowing the nucleosomes to be identified and their orientations to be determined. Linker DNA regions were traced, revealing the trajectories of the chromatin fibers. The trajectories were irregular, with almost no evidence of coiling and no short- or long-range order of the chromosomal material. The 146-bp core particle, long known as a product of nuclease digestion, is identified as the native state of the nucleosome, with no regular spacing along the chromatin fibers.

34731610	The highly lethal brain cancer glioblastoma (GBM) poses a daunting challenge because the blood-brain barrier renders potentially druggable amplified or mutated oncoproteins relatively inaccessible. Here, we identify sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 (SMPD1), an enzyme that regulates the conversion of sphingomyelin to ceramide, as an actionable drug target in GBM. We show that the highly brain-penetrant antidepressant fluoxetine potently inhibits SMPD1 activity, killing GBMs, through inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and via activation of lysosomal stress. Combining fluoxetine with temozolomide, a standard of care for GBM, causes massive increases in GBM cell death and complete tumor regression in mice. Incorporation of real-world evidence from electronic medical records from insurance databases reveals significantly increased survival in GBM patients treated with fluoxetine, which was not seen in patients treated with other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. These results nominate the repurposing of fluoxetine as a potentially safe and promising therapy for patients with GBM and suggest prospective randomized clinical trials.

35046531	Effective therapeutic options are still lacking for uveal melanoma (UM) patients who develop metastasis. Metastatic traits of UM are linked to BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) mutations. Cell metabolism is re-programmed in UM with BAP1 mutant UM, but the underlying mechanisms and opportunities for therapeutic intervention remain unclear. BAP1 mutant UM tumors have an elevated glycolytic gene expression signature, with increased expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex and PDH kinase (PDHK1). Furthermore, BAP1 mutant UM cells showed higher levels of phosphorylated PDHK1 and PDH that was associated with an upregulated glycolytic profile compared to BAP1 wild-type UM cells. Suppressing PDHK1-PDH phosphorylation decreased glycolytic capacity and cell growth, and induced cell cycle arrest of BAP1 mutant UM cells. Our results suggest that PDHK1-PDH phosphorylation is a causative factor of glycolytic phenotypes found in BAP1 mutant UM and propose a therapeutic opportunity for BAP1 mutant UM patients.

34896393	Disturbance of the dynamic balance between tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of signaling molecules, controlled by protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), is known to lead to the development of cancer. While most approved targeted cancer therapies are tyrosine kinase inhibitors, PTPs have long been stigmatized as undruggable and have only recently gained renewed attention in drug discovery. One PTP target is the Src-homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2). SHP2 is implicated in tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, and treatment resistance, primarily because of its role as a signaling nexus of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, acting upstream of the small GTPase Ras. Efforts to develop small molecules that target SHP2 are ongoing, and several SHP2 allosteric inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumors. However, while the reported allosteric inhibitors are highly effective against cells expressing WT SHP2, none have significant activity against the most frequent oncogenic SHP2 variants that drive leukemogenesis in several juvenile and acute leukemias. Here, we report the discovery of novel furanylbenzamide molecules as inhibitors of both WT and oncogenic SHP2. Importantly, these inhibitors readily cross cell membranes, bind and inhibit SHP2 under physiological conditions, and effectively decrease the growth of cancer cells, including triple-negative breast cancer cells, acute myeloid leukemia cells expressing either WT or oncogenic SHP2, and patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia cells. These novel compounds are effective chemical probes of active SHP2 and may serve as starting points for therapeutics targeting WT or mutant SHP2 in cancer.

34743206	While aneuploidy is a main enabling characteristic of cancers, it also creates specific vulnerabilities. Here we demonstrate that Ran inhibition targets epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) survival through its characteristic aneuploidy. We show that induction of aneuploidy in rare diploid EOC cell lines or normal cells renders them highly dependent on Ran. We also establish an inverse correlation between Ran and the tumor suppressor NR1D1 and reveal the critical role of Ran/NR1D1 axis in aneuploidy-associated endogenous DNA damage repair. Mechanistically, we show that Ran, through the maturation of miR4472, destabilizes the mRNA of NR1D1 impacting several DNA repair pathways. We showed that NR1D1 interacts with both PARP1 and BRCA1 leading to the inhibition of DNA repair. Concordantly, loss of Ran was associated with NR1D1 induction, accumulation of DNA damages, and lethality of aneuploid EOC cells. Our findings suggest a synthetic lethal strategy targeting aneuploid cells based on their dependency to Ran.

34469719	Although understanding the diversity of HIV-1 reservoirs is key to achieving a cure, their study at the single-cell level in primary samples remains challenging. We combine flow cytometric multiplexed fluorescent in situ RNA hybridization for different viral genes with HIV-1 p24 protein detection, cell phenotyping, and downstream near-full-length single-cell vDNA sequencing. Stimulation-induced viral RNA-positive (vRNA(+)) cells from viremic and antiretroviral-therapy (ART)-suppressed individuals differ in their ability to produce p24. In participants on ART, latency-reversing agents (LRAs) induce a wide variety of viral gene transcription and translation patterns with LRA class-specific differences in reactivation potency. Reactivated proviruses, including in p24(+) cells, are mostly defective. Although LRAs efficiently induce transcription in all memory cell subsets, we observe induction of translation mostly in effector memory cells, rather than in the long-lived central memory pool. We identify HIV-1 clones with diverse transcriptional and translational patterns between individual cells, and this finding suggests that cell-intrinsic factors influence reservoir persistence and heterogeneity.

34914162	SARS-CoV-2 infection results in impaired interferon response in patients with severe COVID-19. However, how SARS-CoV-2 interferes with host immune responses is incompletely understood. Here, we sequence small RNAs from SARS-CoV-2-infected human cells and identify a microRNA (miRNA) derived from a recently evolved region of the viral genome. We show that the virus-derived miRNA produces two miRNA isoforms in infected cells by the enzyme Dicer, which are loaded into Argonaute proteins. Moreover, the predominant miRNA isoform targets the 3'UTR of interferon-stimulated genes and represses their expression in a miRNA-like fashion. Finally, the two viral miRNA isoforms were detected in nasopharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 patients. We propose that SARS-CoV-2 can potentially employ a virus-derived miRNA to hijack the host miRNA machinery, which could help to evade the interferon-mediated immune response.

34644573	Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a commonly inherited form of autism and intellectual disability, is associated with emotional symptoms that implicate dysfunction of the amygdala. However, current understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease is based primarily on studies in the hippocampus and neocortex, where FXS defects have been corrected by inhibiting group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Here, we observe that activation, rather than inhibition, of mGluRs in the basolateral amygdala reverses impairments in a rat model of FXS. FXS rats exhibit deficient recall of auditory conditioned fear, which is accompanied by a range of in vitro and in vivo deficits in synaptic transmission and plasticity. We find presynaptic mGluR5 in the amygdala, activation of which reverses deficient synaptic transmission and plasticity, thereby restoring normal fear learning in FXS rats. This highlights the importance of modifying the prevailing mGluR-based framework for therapeutic strategies to include circuit-specific differences in FXS pathophysiology.

34478709	Chitin deacetylases (CDAs) are found in many different organisms ranging from marine bacteria to fungi and insects. These enzymes catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from chitinous substrates generating various chitosans, linear copolymers consisting of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and glucosamine. CDAs influence the degree of acetylation of chitosans as well as their pattern of acetylation, a parameter that was recently shown to influence the physicochemical properties and biological activities of chitosans. The binding site of CDAs typically consists of around four subsites, each accommodating a single sugar unit of the substrate. It has been hypothesized that the subsite preferences for GlcNAc or glucosamine units play a crucial role in the acetylation pattern they generate, but so far, this characteristic was largely ignored and still lacks structural data on the involved residues. Here, we determined the crystal structure of an Aspergillus niger CDA. Then, we used molecular dynamics simulations, backed up with a variety of in vitro activity assays using different well-defined polymeric and oligomeric substrates, to study this CDA in detail. We found that Aspergillus niger CDA strongly prefers a GlcNAc sugar unit at its -1 subsite and shows a weak GlcNAc preference at the other noncatalytic subsites, which was apparent both when deacetylating and N-acetylating oligomeric substrates. Overall, our results show that the combination of in vitro and in silico methods used here enables the detailed analysis of CDAs, including their subsite preferences, which could influence their substrate targets and the characteristics of chitosans produced by these species.

34731613	"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) are intracellular Ca(2+) channels that link extracellular stimuli to Ca(2+) signals. Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores is ""quantal"": low IP3 concentrations rapidly release a fraction of the stores. Ca(2+) release then slows or terminates without compromising responses to further IP3 additions. The mechanisms are unresolved. Here, we synthesize a high-affinity partial agonist of IP3Rs and use it to demonstrate that quantal responses do not require heterogenous Ca(2+) stores. IP3Rs respond incrementally to IP3 and close after the initial response to low IP3 concentrations. Comparing functional responses with IP3 binding shows that only a tiny fraction of a cell's IP3Rs mediate incremental Ca(2+) release; inactivation does not therefore affect most IP3Rs. We conclude, and test by simulations, that Ca(2+) signals evoked by IP3 pulses arise from rapid activation and then inactivation of very few IP3Rs. This allows IP3Rs to behave as increment detectors mediating graded Ca(2+) release."	Quantal Ca(2+) release mediated by very few IP3 receptors that rapidly inactivate allows graded responses to IP3.

34634307	Cytochromes P450 are versatile enzymes that function in endobiotic and xenobiotic metabolism and undergo meaningful structural changes that relate to their function. However, the way in which conformational changes inform the specific recognition of the substrate is often unknown. Here, we demonstrate the utility of fluorine ((19)F)-NMR spectroscopy to monitor structural changes in CYP121A1, an essential enzyme from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. CYP121A1 forms functional dimers that catalyze the phenol-coupling reaction of the dipeptide dicyclotyrosine. The thiol-reactive compound 3-bromo-1,1,1-trifluoroacetone was used to label an S171C mutation of the enzyme FG loop, which is located adjacent to the homodimer interface. Substrate titrations and inhibitor-bound (19)F-NMR spectra indicate that ligand binding reduces conformational heterogeneity at the FG loop in both the dimer and in an engineered monomer of CYP121A1. However, only the dimer was found to promote a substrate-bound conformation that was preexisting in the substrate-free spectra, thus confirming a role for the dimer interface in dicyclotyrosine recognition. Moreover, (19)F-NMR spectra in the presence of substrate analogs indicate the hydrogen-bonding feature of the dipeptide aromatic side chain as a dicyclotyrosine specificity criterion. This study demonstrates the utility of (19)F-NMR as applied to a multimeric cytochrome P450, while also revealing mechanistic insights for an essential M. tuberculosis enzyme.

34731633	Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) show variable differentiation potential due to their epigenomic heterogeneity, whose extent/attributes remain unclear, except for well-studied elements/chromosomes such as imprints and the X chromosomes. Here, we show that seven hiPSC lines with variable germline potential exhibit substantial epigenomic heterogeneity, despite their uniform transcriptomes. Nearly a quarter of autosomal regions bear potentially differential chromatin modifications, with promoters/CpG islands for H3K27me3/H2AK119ub1 and evolutionarily young retrotransposons for H3K4me3. We identify 145 large autosomal blocks (>/=100 kb) with differential H3K9me3 enrichment, many of which are lamina-associated domains (LADs) in somatic but not in embryonic stem cells. A majority of these epigenomic heterogeneities are independent of genetic variations. We identify an X chromosome state with chromosome-wide H3K9me3 that stably prevents X chromosome erosion. Importantly, the germline potential of female hiPSCs correlates with X chromosome inactivation. We propose that inherent genomic properties, including CpG density, transposons, and LADs, engender epigenomic heterogeneity in hiPSCs.

34752000	"Gram-negative bacteria use type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) to deliver toxic effector proteins into neighboring cells. Cargo effectors are secreted by binding noncovalently to the T6SS apparatus. Occasionally, effector secretion is assisted by an adaptor protein, although the adaptor itself is not secreted. Here, we report a new T6SS secretion mechanism, in which an effector and a co-effector are secreted together. Specifically, we identify a novel periplasm-targeting effector that is secreted together with its co-effector, which contains a MIX (marker for type sIX effector) domain previously reported only in polymorphic toxins. The effector and co-effector directly interact, and they are dependent on each other for secretion.

34625710	CCL11, also known as eotaxin-1, is described as an eosinophil chemoattractant, which has been implicated in allergic and Th2 inflammatory diseases. We have reported that CCL11 is significantly increased in the serum of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, colonic eosinophils are increased and correlate with tissue CCL11 levels in ulcerative colitis patients, and CCL11 is increased in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine colitis. Here, we show that CCL11 is involved in the pathogenesis of DSS-induced colitis and in colon tumorigenesis in the azoxymethane (AOM)-DSS model of colitis-associated carcinogenesis (CAC). Ccl11(-/-) mice exposed to DSS then allowed to recover had significantly less body weight loss and a decrease in histologic injury versus wild-type (WT) mice. In the AOM-DSS model, Ccl11(-/-) mice exhibited decreased colonic tumor number and burden, histologic injury, and colonic eosinophil infiltration versus WT mice. Ccl11 is expressed by both colonic epithelial and lamina propria immune cells. Studies in bone marrow chimera mice revealed that hematopoietic- and epithelial-cell-derived CCL11 were both important for tumorigenesis in the AOM-DSS model. These findings indicate that CCL11 is important in the regulation of colitis and associated carcinogenesis and thus anti-CCL11 antibodies may be useful for treatment and cancer chemoprevention in IBD.

34469726	Hendra virus and Nipah virus (NiV), members of the Henipavirus (HNV) genus, are zoonotic paramyxoviruses known to cause severe disease across six mammalian orders, including humans. We isolated a panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from the B cells of an individual with prior exposure to equine Hendra virus (HeV) vaccine, targeting distinct antigenic sites. The most potent class of cross-reactive antibodies achieves neutralization by blocking viral attachment to the host cell receptors ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3, with a second class being enhanced by receptor binding. mAbs from both classes display synergistic activity in vitro. In a stringent hamster model of NiV Bangladesh (NiVB) infection, antibodies from both classes reduce morbidity and mortality and achieve synergistic protection in combination.

34883099	MhuD is a noncanonical heme oxygenase (HO) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that catalyzes unique heme degradation chemistry distinct from canonical HOs, generating mycobilin products without releasing carbon monoxide. Its crucial role in the Mtb heme uptake pathway has identified MhuD as an auspicious drug target. MhuD is capable of binding either one or two hemes within a single active site, but only the monoheme form was previously reported to be enzymatically active. Here we employed resonance Raman (rR) spectroscopy to examine several factors proposed to impact the reactivity of mono- and diheme MhuD, including heme ruffling, heme pocket hydrophobicity, and amino acid-heme interactions. We determined that the distal heme in the diheme MhuD active site has negligible effects on both the planarity of the His-coordinated heme macrocycle and the strength of the Fe-NHis linkage relative to the monoheme form. Our rR studies using isotopically labeled hemes unveiled unexpected biomolecular dynamics for the process of heme binding that converts MhuD from mono- to diheme form, where the second incoming heme replaces the first as the His75-coordinated heme. Ferrous CO-ligated diheme MhuD was found to exhibit multiple Fe-C-O conformers, one of which contains catalytically predisposed H-bonding interactions with the distal Asn7 residue identical to those in the monoheme form, implying that it is also enzymatically active. This was substantiated by activity assays and MS product analysis that confirmed the diheme form also degrades heme to mycobilins, redefining MhuD's functional paradigm and further expanding our understanding of its role in Mtb physiology.

34467615	The success of cancer immunotherapy is limited to a subset of patients, highlighting the need to identify the processes by which tumors evade immunity. Using CRISPR/Cas9 screening, we reveal that melanoma cells lacking HOIP, the catalytic subunit of LUBAC, are highly susceptible to both NK and CD8(+) T-cell-mediated killing. We demonstrate that HOIP-deficient tumor cells exhibit increased sensitivity to the combined effect of the inflammatory cytokines, TNF and IFN-gamma, released by NK and CD8(+) T cells upon target recognition. Both genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of HOIP augment tumor cell sensitivity to combined TNF and IFN-gamma. Together, we unveil a protective regulatory axis, involving HOIP, which limits a transcription-dependent form of cell death that engages both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic machinery upon exposure to TNF and IFN-gamma. Our findings highlight HOIP inhibition as a potential strategy to harness and enhance the killing capacity of TNF and IFN-gamma during immunotherapy.

34675390	While there is extensive evidence for genetic variation as a basis for treatment resistance, other sources of variation result from cellular plasticity. Using multiple myeloma as an example of an incurable lymphoid malignancy, we show how cancer cells modulate lineage restriction, adapt their enhancer usage and employ cell-intrinsic diversity for survival and treatment escape. By using single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility profiling, we show that distinct transcriptional states co-exist in individual cancer cells and that differential transcriptional regulon usage and enhancer rewiring underlie these alternative transcriptional states. We demonstrate that exposure to standard treatment further promotes transcriptional reprogramming and differential enhancer recruitment while simultaneously reducing developmental potential. Importantly, treatment generates a distinct complement of actionable immunotherapy targets, such as CXCR4, which can be exploited to overcome treatment resistance. Our studies therefore delineate how to transform the cellular plasticity that underlies drug resistance into immuno-oncologic therapeutic opportunities.

34728215	Glycoside hydrolase family 65 (GH65) comprises glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and glycoside phosphorylases (GPs) that act on alpha-glucosidic linkages in oligosaccharides. All previously reported bacterial GH65 enzymes are GPs, whereas all eukaryotic GH65 enzymes known are GHs. In addition, to date, no crystal structure of a GH65 GH has yet been reported. In this study, we use biochemical experiments and X-ray crystallography to examine the function and structure of a GH65 enzyme from Flavobacterium johnsoniae (FjGH65A) that shows low amino acid sequence homology to reported GH65 enzymes. We found that FjGH65A does not exhibit phosphorolytic activity, but it does hydrolyze kojibiose (alpha-1,2-glucobiose) and oligosaccharides containing a kojibiosyl moiety without requiring inorganic phosphate. In addition, stereochemical analysis demonstrated that FjGH65A catalyzes this hydrolytic reaction via an anomer-inverting mechanism. The three-dimensional structures of FjGH65A in native form and in complex with glucose were determined at resolutions of 1.54 and 1.40 A resolutions, respectively. The overall structure of FjGH65A resembled those of other GH65 GPs, and the general acid catalyst Glu(472) was conserved. However, the amino acid sequence forming the phosphate-binding site typical of GH65 GPs was not conserved in FjGH65A. Moreover, FjGH65A had the general base catalyst Glu(616) instead, which is required to activate a nucleophilic water molecule. These results indicate that FjGH65A is an alpha-1,2-glucosidase and is the first bacterial GH found in the GH65 family.

34758304	Cortical function relies on the balanced activation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. However, little is known about the organization and dynamics of shaft excitatory synapses onto cortical inhibitory interneurons. Here, we use the excitatory postsynaptic marker PSD-95, fluorescently labeled at endogenous levels, as a proxy for excitatory synapses onto layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons and parvalbumin-positive (PV(+)) interneurons in the barrel cortex of adult mice. Longitudinal in vivo imaging under baseline conditions reveals that, although synaptic weights in both neuronal types are log-normally distributed, synapses onto PV(+) neurons are less heterogeneous and more stable. Markov model analyses suggest that the synaptic weight distribution is set intrinsically by ongoing cell-type-specific dynamics, and substantial changes are due to accumulated gradual changes. Synaptic weight dynamics are multiplicative, i.e., changes scale with weights, although PV(+) synapses also exhibit an additive component. These results reveal that cell-type-specific processes govern cortical synaptic strengths and dynamics.

34774801	Several amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-related proteins such as FUS, TDP-43, and hnRNPA1 demonstrate liquid-liquid phase separation, and their disease-related mutations correlate with a transition of their liquid droplet form into aggregates. Missense mutations in SQSTM1/p62, which have been identified throughout the gene, are associated with ALS, frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), and Paget's disease of bone. SQSTM1/p62 protein forms liquid droplets through interaction with ubiquitinated proteins, and these droplets serve as a platform for autophagosome formation and the antioxidative stress response via the LC3-interacting region (LIR) and KEAP1-interacting region (KIR) of p62, respectively. However, it remains unclear whether ALS/FTD-related p62 mutations in the LIR and KIR disrupt liquid droplet formation leading to defects in autophagy, the stress response, or both. To evaluate the effects of ALS/FTD-related p62 mutations in the LIR and KIR on a major oxidative stress system, the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, as well as on autophagic turnover, we developed systems to monitor each of these with high sensitivity. These methods such as intracellular protein-protein interaction assay, doxycycline-inducible gene expression system, and gene expression into primary cultured cells with recombinant adenovirus revealed that some mutants, but not all, caused reduced NRF2 activation and delayed autophagic cargo turnover. In contrast, while all p62 mutants demonstrated sufficient ability to form liquid droplets, all of these droplets also exhibited reduced inner fluidity. These results indicate that like other ALS-related mutant proteins, p62 missense mutations result in a primary defect in ALS/FTD via a qualitative change in p62 liquid droplet fluidity.	Phase-separated protein droplets of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-associated p62/SQSTM1 mutants show reduced inner fluidity.	The Journal of biological chemistry	1.0	0
34739032	Microtubules are dynamic cytoskeleton filaments that are essential for a wide range of cellular processes. They are polymerized from tubulin, a heterodimer of alpha- and beta-subunits. Most eukaryotic organisms express multiple isotypes of alpha- and beta-tubulin, yet their functional relevance in any organism remains largely obscure. The two alpha-tubulin isotypes in budding yeast, Tub1 and Tub3, are proposed to be functionally interchangeable, yet their individual functions have not been rigorously interrogated. Here, we develop otherwise isogenic yeast strains expressing single tubulin isotypes at levels comparable to total tubulin in WT cells. Using genome-wide screening, we uncover unique interactions between the isotypes and the two major mitotic spindle positioning mechanisms. We further exploit these cells to demonstrate that Tub1 and Tub3 optimize spindle positioning by differentially recruiting key components of the Dyn1- and Kar9-dependent mechanisms, respectively. Our results provide novel mechanistic insights into how tubulin isotypes allow highly conserved microtubules to function in diverse cellular processes.

34965433	Animals encounter microorganisms in their habitats, adapting physiology and behavior accordingly. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is found in microbe-rich environments; however, its responses to fungi are not extensively studied. Here, we describe interactions of C. elegans and Penicillium brevicompactum, an ecologically relevant mold. Transcriptome studies reveal that co-culture upregulates stress response genes, including xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (XMEs), in C. elegans intestine and AMsh glial cells. The nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) NHR-45 and NHR-156 are induction regulators, and mutants that cannot induce XMEs in the intestine when exposed to P. brevicompactum experience mitochondrial stress and exhibit developmental defects. Different C. elegans wild isolates harbor sequence polymorphisms in nhr-156, resulting in phenotypic diversity in AMsh glia responses to microbe exposure. We propose that P. brevicompactum mitochondria-targeting mycotoxins are deactivated by intestinal detoxification, allowing tolerance to moldy environments. Our studies support the idea that C. elegans NHRs may be regulated by environmental cues.

34784509	Cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signaling systems (CBASS) are antiviral defense operons that protect bacteria from phage replication. Here, we discover a widespread class of CBASS transmembrane (TM) effector proteins that respond to antiviral nucleotide signals and limit phage propagation through direct membrane disruption. Crystal structures of the Yersinia TM effector Cap15 reveal a compact 8-stranded beta-barrel scaffold that forms a cyclic dinucleotide receptor domain that oligomerizes upon activation. We demonstrate that activated Cap15 relocalizes throughout the cell and specifically induces rupture of the inner membrane. Screening for active effectors, we identify the function of distinct families of CBASS TM effectors and demonstrate that cell death via disruption of inner-membrane integrity is a common mechanism of defense. Our results reveal the function of the most prominent class of effector protein in CBASS immunity and define disruption of the inner membrane as a widespread strategy of abortive infection in bacterial phage defense.

34929169	Heparin, a naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan, has been found to have antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of COVID-19. To elucidate the mechanistic basis for the antiviral activity of heparin, we investigated the binding of heparin to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein by means of sliding window docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical assays. Our simulations show that heparin binds at long, positively charged patches on the spike glycoprotein, thereby masking basic residues of both the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the multifunctional S1/S2 site. Biochemical experiments corroborated the simulation results, showing that heparin inhibits the furin-mediated cleavage of spike by binding to the S1/S2 site. Our simulations showed that heparin can act on the hinge region responsible for motion of the RBD between the inactive closed and active open conformations of the spike glycoprotein. In simulations of the closed spike homotrimer, heparin binds the RBD and the N-terminal domain of two adjacent spike subunits and hinders opening. In simulations of open spike conformations, heparin induces stabilization of the hinge region and a change in RBD motion. Our results indicate that heparin can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection by three mechanisms: by allosterically hindering binding to the host cell receptor, by directly competing with binding to host heparan sulfate proteoglycan coreceptors, and by preventing spike cleavage by furin. Furthermore, these simulations provide insights into how host heparan sulfate proteoglycans can facilitate viral infection. Our results will aid the rational optimization of heparin derivatives for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapy.	The binding of heparin to spike glycoprotein inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection by three mechanisms.

34999118	"The mitochondrial enzyme glutaminase C (GAC) is upregulated in many cancer cells to catalyze the first step in glutamine metabolism, the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate. The dependence of cancer cells on this transformed metabolic pathway highlights GAC as a potentially important therapeutic target. GAC acquires maximal catalytic activity upon binding to anionic activators such as inorganic phosphate. To delineate the mechanism of GAC activation, we used the tryptophan substitution of tyrosine 466 in the catalytic site of the enzyme as a fluorescent reporter for glutamine binding in the presence and absence of phosphate. We show that in the absence of phosphate, glutamine binding to the Y466W GAC tetramer exhibits positive cooperativity. A high-resolution X-ray structure of tetrameric Y466W GAC bound to glutamine suggests that cooperativity in substrate binding is coupled to tyrosine 249, located at the edge of the catalytic site (i.e., the ""lid""), adopting two distinct conformations. In one dimer within the GAC tetramer, the lids are open and glutamine binds weakly, whereas, in the adjoining dimer, the lids are closed over the substrates, resulting in higher affinity interactions. When crystallized in the presence of glutamine and phosphate, all four subunits of the Y466W GAC tetramer exhibited bound glutamine with closed lids. Glutamine can bind with high affinity to each subunit, which subsequently undergo simultaneous catalysis.

34644568	To gain insight into the signaling determinants of effector-associated DNA methylation programming among CD8 T cells, we explore the role of interleukin (IL)-12 in the imprinting of IFNg expression during CD8 T cell priming. We observe that anti-CD3/CD28-mediated stimulation of human naive CD8 T cells is not sufficient to induce substantial demethylation of the IFNg promoter. However, anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation in the presence of the inflammatory cytokine, IL-12, results in stable demethylation of the IFNg locus that is commensurate with IFNg expression. IL-12-associated demethylation of the IFNg locus is coupled to cell division through TET2-dependent demethylation in an ex vivo human chimeric antigen receptor T cell model system and an in vivo immunologically competent murine system. Collectively, these data illustrate that IL-12 signaling promotes TET2-mediated effector DNA demethylation programming in CD8 T cells and serve as proof of concept that cytokines can guide induction of epigenetically regulated traits for T cell-based immunotherapies.

34731600	Single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed extensive molecular diversity in gene programs governing mammalian spermatogenesis but fails to delineate their dynamics in the native context of seminiferous tubules, the spatially confined functional units of spermatogenesis. Here, we use Slide-seq, a spatial transcriptomics technology, to generate an atlas that captures the spatial gene expression patterns at near-single-cell resolution in the mouse and human testis. Using Slide-seq data, we devise a computational framework that accurately localizes testicular cell types in individual seminiferous tubules. Unbiased analysis systematically identifies spatially patterned genes and gene programs. Combining Slide-seq with targeted in situ RNA sequencing, we demonstrate significant differences in the cellular compositions of spermatogonial microenvironment between mouse and human testes. Finally, a comparison of the spatial atlas generated from the wild-type and diabetic mouse testis reveals a disruption in the spatial cellular organization of seminiferous tubules as a potential mechanism of diabetes-induced male infertility.

34801551	Human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels are key regulators of cardiac repolarization, neuronal excitability, and tumorigenesis. hERG channels contain N-terminal Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) and C-terminal cyclic nucleotide-binding homology (CNBH) domains with many long-QT syndrome (LQTS)-causing mutations located at the interface between these domains. Despite the importance of PAS/CNBH domain interactions, little is known about their affinity. Here, we used the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique to investigate interactions between isolated PAS and CNBH domains and the effects of LQTS-causing mutations R20G, N33T, and E58D, located at the PAS/CNBH domain interface, on these interactions. We determined that the affinity of the PAS/CNBH domain interactions was approximately 1.4 muM. R20G and E58D mutations had little effect on the domain interaction affinity, while N33T abolished the domain interactions. Interestingly, mutations in the intrinsic ligand, a conserved stretch of amino acids occupying the beta-roll cavity in the CNBH domain, had little effect on the affinity of PAS/CNBH domain interactions. Additionally, we determined that the isolated PAS domains formed oligomers with an interaction affinity of approximately 1.6 muM. Coexpression of the isolated PAS domains with the full-length hERG channels or addition of the purified PAS protein inhibited hERG currents. These PAS/PAS interactions can have important implications for hERG function in normal and pathological conditions associated with increased surface density of channels or interaction with other PAS-domain-containing proteins. Taken together, our study provides the first account of the binding affinities for wild-type and mutant hERG PAS and CNBH domains and highlights the potential functional significance of PAS/PAS domain interactions.

34986352	Vascular endothelium plays a crucial role in vascular homeostasis and tissue fluid balance. To target endothelium for robust genome editing, we developed poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether-block-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PEG-b-PLGA) copolymer-based nanoparticle formulated with polyethyleneimine. A single i.v. administration of mixture of nanoparticles and plasmid DNA expressing Cas9 controlled by CDH5 promoter and guide RNA (U6 promoter) induced highly efficient genome editing in endothelial cells (ECs) of the vasculatures, including lung, heart, aorta, and peripheral vessels in adult mice. Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining demonstrated an approximately 80% decrease of protein expression selectively in ECs, resulting in a phenotype similar to that of genetic knockout mice. Nanoparticle delivery of plasmid DNA could induce genome editing of two genes or genome editing and transgene expression in ECs simultaneously. Thus, nanoparticle delivery of plasmid DNA is a powerful tool to rapidly and efficiently alter expression of gene(s) in ECs for cardiovascular research and potential gene therapy.

34496242	There is broad consensus that RecQ family helicase is a high-order oligomer that dissociates into a dimer upon ATP binding. This conclusion is based mainly on studies of highly purified recombinant proteins, and the oligomeric states of RecQ helicases in living cells remain unknown. We show here that, in contrast to current models, monomeric RECQL helicase is more abundant than oligomer/dimer forms in living cells. Further characterization of endogenous BtRECQL and isolated monomeric BtRECQL using various approaches demonstrates that both endogenous and recombinant monomeric BtRECQL effectively function as monomers, displaying higher helicase and ATPase activities than dimers and oligomers. Furthermore, monomeric BtRECQL unfolds intramolecular G-quadruplex DNA as efficiently as human RECQL and BLM helicases. These discoveries have implications for understanding endogenous RECQL oligomeric structures and their regulation. It is worth revisiting oligomeric states of the other members of the RecQ family helicases in living cells.	Endogenous Bos taurus RECQL is predominantly monomeric and more active than oligomers.

34686332	Nearly one-third of proteins are initially targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where they are correctly folded and then delivered to their final cellular destinations. To prevent the accumulation of misfolded membrane proteins, ER-associated degradation (ERAD) moves these clients from the ER membrane to the cytosol, a process known as retrotranslocation. Our recent work in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals a derlin rhomboid pseudoprotease, Dfm1, is involved in the retrotranslocation of ubiquitinated ERAD membrane substrates. In this study, we identify conserved residues of Dfm1 that are critical for retrotranslocation. We find several retrotranslocation-deficient Loop 1 mutants that display impaired binding to membrane substrates. Furthermore, Dfm1 possesses lipid thinning function to facilitate in the removal of ER membrane substrates, and this feature is conserved in its human homolog, Derlin-1, further implicating that derlin-mediated retrotranslocation is a well-conserved process.	Derlin rhomboid pseudoproteases employ substrate engagement and lipid distortion to enable the retrotranslocation of ERAD membrane substrates.	Cell reports	1.0	0
34728806	MicroRNA-3662 (miR-3662) is minimally expressed in normal human tissues but is highly expressed in all types of cancers, including breast cancer. As determined with The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset, miR-3662 expression is higher in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) and African American breast cancers than in other breast cancer types. However, the functional role of miR-3662 remains a topic of debate. Here, we found that inhibition or knockout of endogenous, mature miR-3662 in TNBC cells suppresses proliferation and migration in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Functional analysis revealed that, for TNBC cells, knockout of miR-3662 reduces the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Furthermore, using CRISPR-mediated miR-3662 activation and repression, dual-luciferase assays, and miRNA/mRNA immunoprecipitation assays, we established that HMG-box transcription factor 1 (HBP-1), a Wnt/beta-catenin signaling inhibitor, is a target of miR-3662 and is most likely responsible for miR-3662-mediated TNBC cell proliferation. Our results suggest that miR-3662 has an oncogenic function in tumor progression and metastasis via an miR-3662-HBP1 axis, regulating the Wnt /beta-catenin signaling pathway in TNBC cells. Since miR-3662 expression occurs a tumor-specific manner, it is a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for patients who have TNBCs with dysregulation of miR-3662, especially African Americans.

34838591	The G-quadruplex (G4) resolvase RNA helicase associated with AU-rich element (RHAU) possesses the ability to unwind G4 structures in both DNA and RNA molecules. Previously, we revealed that RHAU plays a critical role in embryonic heart development and postnatal heart function through modulating mRNA translation and stability. However, whether RHAU functions to resolve DNA G4 in the regulation of cardiac physiology is still elusive. Here, we identified a phenotype of noncompaction cardiomyopathy in cardiomyocyte-specific Rhau deletion mice, including such symptoms as spongiform cardiomyopathy, heart dilation, and death at young ages. We also observed reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation and advanced sarcomere maturation in Rhau mutant mice. Further studies demonstrated that RHAU regulates the expression levels of several genes associated with ventricular trabeculation and compaction, including the Nkx2-5 and Hey2 that encode cardiac transcription factors of NKX2-5 and Hey2, and the myosin heavy chain 7 (Myh7) whose protein product is MYH7. While RHAU modulates Nkx2-5 mRNA and Hey2 mRNA at the post-transcriptional level, we uncovered that RHAU facilitates the transcription of Myh7 through unwinding of the G4 structures in its promoter. These findings demonstrated that RHAU regulates ventricular chamber development through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. These results contribute to a knowledge base that will help to understand the pathogenesis of diseases such as noncompaction cardiomyopathy.

34610291	Although both infections and vaccines induce memory B cell (MBC) populations that participate in secondary immune responses, the MBCs generated in each case can differ. Here, we compare SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (S1-RBD)-specific primary MBCs that form in response to infection or a single mRNA vaccination. Both primary MBC populations have similar frequencies in the blood and respond to a second S1-RBD exposure by rapidly producing plasmablasts with an abundant immunoglobulin (Ig)A(+) subset and secondary MBCs that are mostly IgG(+) and cross-react with the B.1.351 variant. However, infection-induced primary MBCs have better antigen-binding capacity and generate more plasmablasts and secondary MBCs of the classical and atypical subsets than do vaccine-induced primary MBCs. Our results suggest that infection-induced primary MBCs have undergone more affinity maturation than vaccine-induced primary MBCs and produce more robust secondary responses.

34780718	"ClpAP, an ATP-dependent protease consisting of ClpA, a double-ring hexameric unfoldase of the ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities superfamily, and the ClpP peptidase, degrades damaged and unneeded proteins to support cellular proteostasis. ClpA recognizes many protein substrates directly, but it can also be regulated by an adapter, ClpS, that modifies ClpA's substrate profile toward N-degron substrates. Conserved tyrosines in the 12 pore-1 loops lining the central channel of the stacked D1 and D2 rings of ClpA are critical for degradation, but the roles of these residues in individual steps during direct or adapter-mediated degradation are poorly understood. Using engineered ClpA hexamers with zero, three, or six pore-1 loop mutations in each ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities superfamily ring, we found that active D1 pore loops initiate productive engagement of substrates, whereas active D2 pore loops are most important for mediating the robust unfolding of stable native substrates. In complex with ClpS, active D1 pore loops are required to form a high affinity ClpA*ClpS*substrate complex, but D2 pore loops are needed to ""tug on"" and remodel ClpS to transfer the N-degron substrate to ClpA. Overall, we find that the pore-1 loop tyrosines in D1 are critical for direct substrate engagement, whereas ClpS-mediated substrate delivery requires unique contributions from both the D1 and D2 pore loops. In conclusion, our study illustrates how pore loop engagement, substrate capture, and powering of the unfolding/translocation steps are distributed between the two rings of ClpA, illuminating new mechanistic features that may be common to double-ring protein unfolding machines."

34758307	T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation involve metabolic reprogramming resulting from the interplay of genes, proteins, and metabolites. Here, we aim to understand the metabolic pathways involved in the activation and functional differentiation of human CD4(+) T cell subsets (T helper [Th]1, Th2, Th17, and induced regulatory T [iTreg] cells). Here, we combine genome-scale metabolic modeling, gene expression data, and targeted and non-targeted lipidomics experiments, together with in vitro gene knockdown experiments, and show that human CD4(+) T cells undergo specific metabolic changes during activation and functional differentiation. In addition, we confirm the importance of ceramide and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis pathways in Th17 differentiation and effector functions. Through in vitro gene knockdown experiments, we substantiate the requirement of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), a de novo sphingolipid pathway in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-17A and IL17F) by Th17 cells. Our findings provide a comprehensive resource for selective manipulation of CD4(+) T cells under disease conditions characterized by an imbalance of Th17/natural Treg (nTreg) cells.

35021099	Innate-like T cells, including invariant natural killer T cells, mucosal-associated invariant T cells, and gammadelta T cells, are present in various barrier tissues, including the lung, where they carry out protective responses during infections. Here, we investigate their roles during pulmonary pneumococcal infection. Following infection, innate-like T cells rapidly increase in lung tissue, in part through recruitment, but T cell antigen receptor activation and cytokine production occur mostly in interleukin-17-producing NKT17 and gammadelta T cells. NKT17 cells are preferentially located within lung tissue prior to infection, as are CD103(+) dendritic cells, which are important both for antigen presentation to NKT17 cells and gammadelta T cell activation. Whereas interleukin-17-producing gammadelta T cells are numerous, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor is exclusive to NKT17 cells and is required for optimal protection. These studies demonstrate how particular cellular interactions and responses of functional subsets of innate-like T cells contribute to protection from pathogenic lung infection.

34811483	Genetic defects in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) can result in neurological disease triggered by toxic activity of the single-strand-break sensor protein PARP1. However, the mechanism(s) by which this toxic PARP1 activity triggers cellular dysfunction are unclear. Here we show that human cells lacking XRCC1 fail to rapidly recover transcription following DNA base damage, a phenotype also observed in patient-derived fibroblasts with XRCC1 mutations and Xrcc1(-/-) mouse neurons. This defect is caused by excessive/aberrant PARP1 activity during DNA base excision repair, resulting from the loss of PARP1 regulation by XRCC1. We show that aberrant PARP1 activity suppresses transcriptional recovery during base excision repair by promoting excessive recruitment and activity of the ubiquitin protease USP3, which as a result reduces the level of monoubiquitinated histones important for normal transcriptional regulation. Importantly, inhibition and/or deletion of PARP1 or USP3 restores transcriptional recovery in XRCC1(-/-) cells, highlighting PARP1 and USP3 as possible therapeutic targets in neurological disease.

34731619	Evidence for prefrontal cortical (PFC) GABAergic dysfunction is one of the most consistent findings in schizophrenia and may contribute to cognitive deficits. Recent studies suggest that the mGlu1 subtype of metabotropic glutamate receptor regulates cortical inhibition; however, understanding the mechanisms through which mGlu1 positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) regulate PFC microcircuit function and cognition is essential for advancing these potential therapeutics toward the clinic. We report a series of electrophysiology, optogenetic, pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging, and animal behavior studies demonstrating that activation of mGlu1 receptors increases inhibitory transmission in the prelimbic PFC by selective excitation of somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs). An mGlu1 PAM reverses cortical hyperactivity and concomitant cognitive deficits induced by N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists. Using in vivo optogenetics, we show that prelimbic SST-INs are necessary for mGlu1 PAM efficacy. Collectively, these findings suggest that mGlu1 PAMs could reverse cortical GABAergic deficits and exhibit efficacy in treating cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.	mGlu1 potentiation enhances prelimbic somatostatin interneuron activity to rescue schizophrenia-like physiological and cognitive deficits.

34731644	"Biosynthesis scales with cell size such that protein concentrations generally remain constant as cells grow. As an exception, synthesis of the cell-cycle inhibitor Whi5 ""sub-scales"" with cell size so that its concentration is lower in larger cells to promote cell-cycle entry. Here, we find that transcriptional control uncouples Whi5 synthesis from cell size, and we identify histones as the major class of sub-scaling transcripts besides WHI5 by screening for similar genes. Histone synthesis is thereby matched to genome content rather than cell size. Such sub-scaling proteins are challenged by asymmetric cell division because proteins are typically partitioned in proportion to newborn cell volume. To avoid this fate, Whi5 uses chromatin-binding to partition similar protein amounts to each newborn cell regardless of cell size. Disrupting both Whi5 synthesis and chromatin-based partitioning weakens G1 size control. Thus, specific transcriptional and partitioning mechanisms determine protein sub-scaling to control cell size."

34644561	"Tactical disruption of protein synthesis is an attractive therapeutic strategy, with the first-in-class eIF4A-targeting compound zotatifin in clinical evaluation for cancer and COVID-19. The full cellular impact and mechanisms of these potent molecules are undefined at a proteomic level. Here, we report mass spectrometry analysis of translational reprogramming by rocaglates, cap-dependent initiation disruptors that include zotatifin. We find effects to be far more complex than simple ""translational inhibition"" as currently defined. Translatome analysis by TMT-pSILAC (tandem mass tag-pulse stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture mass spectrometry) reveals myriad upregulated proteins that drive hitherto unrecognized cytotoxic mechanisms, including GEF-H1-mediated anti-survival RHOA/JNK activation. Surprisingly, these responses are not replicated by eIF4A silencing, indicating a broader translational adaptation than currently understood. Translation machinery analysis by MATRIX (mass spectrometry analysis of active translation factors using ribosome density fractionation and isotopic labeling experiments) identifies rocaglate-specific dependence on specific translation factors including eEF1epsilon1 that drive translatome remodeling.

34615995	Metastasis of bladder cancer is a complex process and has been associated with poor clinical outcomes. However, the mechanisms of bladder cancer metastasis remain largely unknown. The present study found that the long noncoding RNA lnc00892 was significantly downregulated in bladder cancer tissues, with low lnc00892 expression associated with poor prognosis of bladder cancer patients. Lnc00892 significantly inhibited the migration, invasion, and metastasis of bladder cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In-depth analysis showed that RhoA/C acted downstream of lnc00892 to inhibit bladder cancer metastasis. Mechanistically, lnc00892 reduces nucleolin gene transcription by competitively binding the promoter of nucleolin with c-Jun, thereby inhibiting nucleolin-mediated stabilization of RhoA/RhoC mRNA. Taken together, these findings provide novel insights into understanding the mechanisms of bladder cancer metastasis and suggest that lnc00892 can serve as a potential therapeutic target in patients with invasive bladder cancer.

34801548	Small GTPases cycle between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound state to control various cellular events, such as cell proliferation, cytoskeleton organization, and membrane trafficking. Clarifying the guanine nucleotide-bound states of small GTPases is vital for understanding the regulation of small GTPase functions and the subsequent cellular responses. Although several methods have been developed to analyze small GTPase activities, our knowledge of the activities for many small GTPases is limited, partly because of the lack of versatile methods to estimate small GTPase activity without unique probes and specialized equipment. In the present study, we developed a versatile and straightforward HPLC-based assay to analyze the activation status of small GTPases by directly quantifying the amounts of guanine nucleotides bound to them. This assay was validated by analyzing the RAS-subfamily GTPases, including HRAS, which showed that the ratios of GTP-bound forms were comparable with those obtained in previous studies. Furthermore, we applied this assay to the investigation of psychiatric disorder-associated mutations of RHEB (RHEB/P37L and RHEB/S68P), revealing that both mutations cause an increase in the ratio of the GTP-bound form in cells. Mechanistically, loss of sensitivity to TSC2 (a GTPase-activating protein for RHEB) for RHEB/P37L, as well as both decreased sensitivity to TSC2 and accelerated guanine-nucleotide exchange for RHEB/S68P, is involved in the increase of their GTP-bound forms, respectively. In summary, the HPLC-based assay developed in this study provides a valuable tool for analyzing small GTPases for which the activities and regulatory mechanisms are less well understood.

34584219	In breast cancer the transcription factor SOX4 has been shown to be associated with poor survival, increased tumor size and metastasis formation. This has mostly been attributed to the ability of SOX4 to regulate Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal-Transition (EMT). However, SOX4 regulates target gene transcription in a context-dependent manner that is determined by the cellular and epigenetic state. In this study we have investigated the loss of SOX4 in mammary tumor development utilizing organoids derived from a PyMT genetic mouse model of breast cancer. Using CRISPR/Cas9 to abrogate SOX4 expression, we found that SOX4 is required for inhibiting differentiation by regulating a subset of genes that are highly activated in fetal mammary stem cells (fMaSC). In this way, SOX4 re-activates an oncogenic transcriptional program that is regulated in many progenitor cell-types during embryonic development. SOX4-knockout organoids are characterized by the presence of more differentiated cells that exhibit luminal or basal gene expression patterns, but lower expression of cell cycle genes. In agreement, primary tumor growth and metastatic outgrowth in the lungs are impaired in SOX4(KO) tumors. Finally, SOX4(KO) tumors show a severe loss in competitive capacity to grow out compared to SOX4-proficient cells in primary tumors. Our study identifies a novel role for SOX4 in maintaining mammary tumors in an undifferentiated and proliferative state. Therapeutic manipulation of SOX4 function could provide a novel strategy for cancer differentiation therapy, which would promote differentiation and inhibit cycling of tumor cells.

34774800	The inflammatory tumor microenvironment has been implicated as a major player fueling tumor progression and an enabling characteristic of cancer, proline, glutamic acid, and leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1) is a novel nuclear receptor coregulator that signals across diverse signaling networks, and its expression is altered in several cancers. However, investigations to find the role of PELP1 in inflammation-driven oncogenesis are limited. Molecular studies here, utilizing macrophage cell lines and animal models upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or necrotic cells, showed that PELP1 is an inflammation-inducible gene. Studies on the PELP1 promoter and its mutant identified potential binding of c-Rel, an NF-kappaB transcription factor subunit, to PELP1 promoter upon LPS stimulation in macrophages. Recruitment of c-Rel onto the PELP1 promoter was validated by chromatin immunoprecipitation, further confirming LPS mediated PELP1 expression through c-Rel-specific transcriptional regulation. Macrophages that overexpress PELP1 induces granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor secretion, which mediates cancer progression in a paracrine manner. Results from preclinical studies with normal-inflammatory-tumor progression models demonstrated a progressive increase in the PELP1 expression, supporting this link between inflammation and cancer. In addition, animal studies demonstrated the connection of PELP1 in inflammation-directed cancer progression. Taken together, our findings provide the first report on c-Rel-specific transcriptional regulation of PELP1 in inflammation and possible granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-mediated transformation potential of activated macrophages on epithelial cells in the inflammatory tumor microenvironment, reiterating the link between PELP1 and inflammation-induced oncogenesis.

34551296	Pathological hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau (pTau) and neuroinflammation, driven by interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), are the major hallmarks of tauopathies. Here, we show that pTau primes and activates IL-1beta. First, RNA-sequence analysis suggests paired-helical filaments (PHFs) from human tauopathy brain primes nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), chemokine, and IL-1beta signaling clusters in human primary microglia. Treating microglia with pTau-containing neuronal media, exosomes, or PHFs causes IL-1beta activation, which is NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 dependent. Suppression of pTau or ASC reduces tau pathology and inflammasome activation in rTg4510 and hTau mice, respectively. Although the deletion of MyD88 prevents both IL-1beta expression and activation in the hTau mouse model of tauopathy, ASC deficiency in myeloid cells reduces pTau-induced IL-1beta activation and improves cognitive function in hTau mice. Finally, pTau burden co-exists with elevated IL-1beta and ASC in autopsy brains of human tauopathies. Together, our results suggest pTau activates IL-1beta via MyD88- and NLRP3-ASC-dependent pathways in myeloid cells, including microglia.

34509476	During vascular interventions, oxidized low-density lipoprotein and lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) accumulate at the site of arterial injury, inhibiting endothelial cell (EC) migration and arterial healing. LysoPC activates canonical transient receptor potential 6 (TRPC6) channels, leading to a prolonged increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration that inhibits EC migration. However, an initial increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration is required to activate TRPC6, and this mechanism remains elusive. We hypothesized that lysoPC activates the lipid-cleaving enzyme phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which releases arachidonic acid (AA) from the cellular membrane to open arachidonate-regulated calcium channels, allowing calcium influx that promotes externalization and activation of TRPC6 channels. The focus of this study was to identify the roles of calcium-dependent and/or calcium-independent PLA2 in lysoPC-induced TRPC6 externalization. We show that lysoPC induced PLA2 enzymatic activity and caused AA release in bovine aortic ECs. To identify the specific subgroup and the isoform(s) of PLA2 involved in lysoPC-induced TRPC6 activation, transient knockdown studies were performed in the human endothelial cell line EA.hy926 using siRNA to inhibit the expression of genes encoding cPLA2alpha, cPLA2gamma, iPLA2beta, or iPLA2gamma. Downregulation of the beta isoform of iPLA2 blocked lysoPC-induced release of AA from EC membranes and TRPC6 externalization, as well as preserved EC migration in the presence of lysoPC. We propose that blocking TRPC6 activation and promoting endothelial healing could improve the outcomes for patients undergoing cardiovascular interventions.

34874744	Salivary glands are damaged by radiotherapy for head and neck cancers, which often culminates in radiation-induced hyposalivation and xerostomia that may be permanent. Here, we identified a central role for YAP in the regenerative response of the salivary gland. Activation of the Hippo signaling pathway inhibits the phosphorylation of YAP, leading to its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. Using mice with salivary gland injury induced by surgical ligation and salivary gland-derived organoids, we found that YAP nuclear localization in the salivary gland epithelium changed dynamically between homeostasis and regeneration. Whereas local injury had no effect on nuclear YAP localization in saliva-producing acinar cells, it triggered nuclear accumulation of YAP in saliva-transporting ductal cells. Injury also stimulated the proliferation of ductal cells, which were mainly quiescent under homeostatic conditions and in nonregenerating areas distal to the injury site, thus enabling salivary gland regeneration. Overexpressing YAP or driving YAP nuclear translocation by inhibiting upstream Hippo pathway kinases increased the capacity of mouse and human salivary gland cells, including human cells that had been irradiated, to form lobed organoids in vitro. Our results identify a YAP-driven regeneration program in salivary gland ductal cells that could be used to promote salivary gland regeneration after irradiation-induced damage.

34480901	In Alzheimer's disease (AD), deposition of pathological tau and amyloid-beta (Abeta) drive synaptic loss and cognitive decline. The injection of misfolded tau aggregates extracted from human AD brains drives templated spreading of tau pathology within WT mouse brain. Here, we assessed the impact of Abeta copathology, of deleting loci known to modify AD risk (Ptk2b, Grn, and Tmem106b) and of pharmacological intervention with an Fyn kinase inhibitor on tau spreading after injection of AD tau extracts. The density and spreading of tau inclusions triggered by human tau seed were unaltered in the hippocampus and cortex of APPswe/PSEN1DeltaE9 transgenic and App(NL-F/NL-F) knock-in mice. In mice with human tau sequence replacing mouse tau, template matching enhanced neuritic tau burden. Human AD brain tau-enriched preparations contained aggregated Abeta, and the Abeta coinjection caused a redistribution of Abeta aggregates in mutant AD model mice. The injection-induced Abeta phenotype was spatially distinct from tau accumulation and could be ameliorated by depleting Abeta from tau extracts. These data suggest that Abeta and tau pathologies propagate by largely independent mechanisms after their initial formation. Altering the activity of the Fyn and Pyk2 (Ptk2b) kinases involved in Abeta-oligomer-induced signaling, or deleting expression of the progranulin and TMEM106B lysosomal proteins, did not alter the somatic tau inclusion burden or spreading. However, mouse aging had a prominent effect to increase the accumulation of neuritic tau after injection of human AD tau seeds into WT mice. These studies refine our knowledge of factors capable of modulating tau spreading.	Spreading of Alzheimer tau seeds is enhanced by aging and template matching with limited impact of amyloid-beta.

34496244	For plants, light is the source of energy and the most relevant regulator of growth and adaptations to the environment by inducing changes in gene expression at various levels, including alternative splicing. Light-triggered chloroplast retrograde signals control alternative splicing in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we provide evidence that light regulates the expression of a core set of splicing-related factors in roots. Alternative splicing responses in roots are not directly caused by light but are instead most likely triggered by photosynthesized sugars. The target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase plays a key role in this shoot-to-root signaling pathway. Knocking down TOR expression or pharmacologically inhibiting TOR activity disrupts the alternative splicing responses to light and exogenous sugars in roots. Consistently, splicing decisions are modulated by mitochondrial activity in roots. In conclusion, by activating the TOR pathway, sugars act as mobile signals to coordinate alternative splicing responses to light throughout the whole plant.	Light regulates alternative splicing outcomes via the TOR kinase pathway.	Cell reports	1.0	0
34764443	Brain tumors actively reprogram their cellular metabolism to survive and proliferate, thus offering potential therapeutic opportunities. Over the past decade, extensive research has been done on mutant IDH enzymes as markers of good prognosis in glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain tumor in adults with dismal prognosis. Yet, 95% of glioblastoma are IDH wild-type. Here, we review current knowledge about IDH wild-type enzymes and their putative role in mechanisms driving tumor progression. After a brief overview on tumor metabolic adaptation, we present the diverse metabolic function of IDH enzymes and their roles in glioblastoma initiation, progression and response to treatments. Finally, we will discuss wild-type IDH targeting in primary glioblastoma.	Wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase under the spotlight in glioblastoma.	Oncogene	0.0	0
34715125	Mitochondrial protein translocation is an intricately regulated process that requires dedicated translocases at the outer and inner membranes. The presequence translocase complex, translocase of the inner membrane 23, facilitates most of the import of preproteins containing presequences into the mitochondria, and its primary structural organization is highly conserved. As part of the translocase motor, two J-proteins, DnaJC15 and DnaJC19, are recruited to form two independent translocation machineries (translocase A and translocase B, respectively). On the other hand, the J-like protein subunit of translocase of the inner membrane 23, Mitochondria-associated granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor signaling molecule (Magmas) (orthologous to the yeast subunit Pam16), can regulate human import-motor activity by forming a heterodimer with DnaJC19 and DnaJC15. However, the precise coordinated regulation of two human import motors by a single Magmas protein is poorly understood. Here, we report two additional Magmas variants (Magmas-1 and Magmas-2) constitutively expressed in the mammalian system. Both the Magmas variants are functional orthologs of Pam16 with an evolutionarily conserved J-like domain critical for cell survival. Moreover, the Magmas variants are peripherally associated with the inner membrane as part of the human import motor for translocation. Our results demonstrate that Magmas-1 is predominantly recruited to translocase B, whereas Magmas-2 is majorly associated with translocase A. Strikingly, both the variants exhibit differential J-protein inhibitory activity in modulating import motor, thereby regulating overall translocase function. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that additional Magmas variants are of evolutionary significance in humans to maximize protein import in familial-linked pathological conditions.	Multiple variants of the human presequence translocase motor subunit Magmas govern the mitochondrial import.	The Journal of biological chemistry	2.0	0
34742737	Notch2(tm1.1Ecan) mice, which harbor a mutation replicating that found in Hajdu-Cheney syndrome, exhibit marked osteopenia because of increased osteoclast number and bone resorption. Hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1) is a Notch target gene and a transcriptional modulator that determines osteoclast cell fate decisions. Transcript levels of Hes1 increase in Notch2(tm1.1Ecan) bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) as they mature into osteoclasts, suggesting a role in osteoclastogenesis. To determine whether HES1 is responsible for the phenotype of Notch2(tm1.1Ecan) mice and the skeletal manifestations of Hajdu-Cheney syndrome, Hes1 was inactivated in Ctsk-expressing cells from Notch2(tm1.1Ecan) mice. Ctsk encodes the protease cathepsin K, which is expressed preferentially by osteoclasts. We found that the osteopenia of Notch2(tm1.1Ecan) mice was ameliorated, and the enhanced osteoclastogenesis was reversed in the context of the Hes1 inactivation. Microcomputed tomography revealed that the downregulation of Hes1 in Ctsk-expressing cells led to increased bone volume/total volume in female mice. In addition, cultures of BMMs from Ctsk(Cre/WT);Hes1(Delta/Delta) mice displayed a decrease in osteoclast number and size and decreased bone-resorbing capacity. Moreover, activation of HES1 in Ctsk-expressing cells led to osteopenia and enhanced osteoclast number, size, and bone resorptive capacity in BMM cultures. Osteoclast phenotypes and RNA-Seq of cells in which HES1 was activated revealed that HES1 modulates cell-cell fusion and bone-resorbing capacity by supporting sealing zone formation. In conclusion, we demonstrate that HES1 is mechanistically relevant to the skeletal manifestation of Notch2(tm1.1Ecan) mice and is a novel determinant of osteoclast differentiation and function.	Hairy and enhancer of split 1 is a primary effector of NOTCH2 signaling and induces osteoclast differentiation and function.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0.0	0
34592157	"Optical implants to control and monitor neuronal activity in vivo have become foundational tools of neuroscience. Standard two-dimensional histology of the implant location, however, often suffers from distortion and loss during tissue processing. To address that, we developed a three-dimensional post hoc histology method called ""light-guided sectioning"" (LiGS), which preserves the tissue with its optical implant in place and allows staining and clearing of a volume up to 500 mum in depth. We demonstrate the use of LiGS to determine the precise location of an optical fiber relative to a deep brain target and to investigate the implant-tissue interface. We show accurate cell registration of ex vivo histology with single-cell, two-photon calcium imaging, obtained through gradient refractive index (GRIN) lenses, and identify subpopulations based on immunohistochemistry. LiGS provides spatial information in experimental paradigms that use optical fibers and GRIN lenses and could help increase reproducibility through identification of fiber-to-target localization and molecular profiling."

35081363	Gene silencing by heterochromatin plays a crucial role in cell identity. Here, we characterize the localization, the biogenesis, and the function of an atypical heterochromatin, which is simultaneously enriched in the typical H3K9me3 mark and in H3K36me3, a histone mark usually associated with gene expression. We identified thousands of dual regions in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells that rely on the histone methyltransferases SET domain bifurcated 1 (SETDB1) and nuclear set domain (NSD)-containing proteins to generate H3K9me3 and H3K36me3, respectively. Upon SETDB1 removal, dual domains lose both marks, gain signatures of active enhancers, and come into contact with upregulated genes, suggesting that it might be an important pathway by which genes are controlled by heterochromatin. In differentiated tissues, a subset of these dual domains is destabilized and becomes enriched in active enhancer marks, providing a mechanistic insight into the involvement of heterochromatin in the maintenance of cell identity.

34731621	N-type voltage-gated calcium (CaV) channels mediate Ca(2+) influx at presynaptic terminals in response to action potentials and play vital roles in synaptogenesis, release of neurotransmitters, and nociceptive transmission. Here, we elucidate a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the human CaV2.2 complex in apo, ziconotide-bound, and two CaV2.2-specific pore blockers-bound states. The second voltage-sensing domain (VSD) is captured in a resting-state conformation, trapped by a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) molecule, which is distinct from the other three VSDs of CaV2.2, as well as activated VSDs observed in previous structures of CaV channels. This structure reveals the molecular basis for the unique inactivation process of CaV2.2 channels, in which the intracellular gate formed by S6 helices is closed and a W-helix from the domain II-III linker stabilizes closed-state inactivation. The structures of this inactivated, drug-bound complex lay a solid foundation for developing new state-dependent blockers for treatment of chronic pain.

34551292	Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are designed to learn sequential patterns in silico, but it is unclear whether and how an RNN forms in the native networks of the mammalian brain. Here, we report an innate RNN, which is formed by the unidirectional connections from three basic units: input units arriving from emotion regions, a hidden unit in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and output units located at the somatic motor cortex (sMO). Specifically, the neurons from basal lateral amygdala (BLA) and the insular cortex (IC) project to the mPFC motor-cortex-projecting (MP) neurons. These MP neurons form a local self-feedback loop and target major projecting neurons of the sMO. Within the sMO, the neurons in the infragranular layers receive stronger input than the neurons in supragranular layers. Finally, we show in vivo evidence that the communications from the emotion regions to the sMO are abolished when MP neurons are chemogenetically silenced.

34551302	Gut microbiota-mediated secondary bile acids (BAs) play an important role in energy balance and host metabolism via G protein-coupled receptors and/or nuclear receptors. Emerging evidence suggests that BAs are important for maintaining innate immune responses via these receptors. However, the effect of BAs on autoimmune uveitis is still unknown. Here, we demonstrate decreased microbiota-related secondary BA concentration in feces and serum of animals with experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). Restoration of the gut BAs pool attenuates severity of EAU in association with inhibition of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)-related pro-inflammatory cytokines in dendritic cells (DCs). TGR5 deficiency partially reverses the inhibitory effect of deoxycholic acid (DCA) on DCs. TGR5 signaling also inhibits NF-kappaB activation via the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway in DCs. Additionally, both DCA and TGR5 agonists inhibit human monocyte-derived DC activation. Taken together, our results suggest that BA metabolism plays an important role in adaptive immune responses and might be a therapeutic target in autoimmune uveitis.

35051350	Pseudouridine is a modified nucleotide that is prevalent in human mRNAs and is dynamically regulated. Here, we investigate when in their life cycle mRNAs become pseudouridylated to illuminate the potential regulatory functions of endogenous mRNA pseudouridylation. Using single-nucleotide resolution pseudouridine profiling on chromatin-associated RNA from human cells, we identified pseudouridines in nascent pre-mRNA at locations associated with alternatively spliced regions, enriched near splice sites, and overlapping hundreds of binding sites for RNA-binding proteins. In vitro splicing assays establish a direct effect of individual endogenous pre-mRNA pseudouridines on splicing efficiency. We validate hundreds of pre-mRNA sites as direct targets of distinct pseudouridine synthases and show that PUS1, PUS7, and RPUSD4-three pre-mRNA-modifying pseudouridine synthases with tissue-specific expression-control widespread changes in alternative pre-mRNA splicing and 3' end processing. Our results establish a vast potential for cotranscriptional pre-mRNA pseudouridylation to regulate human gene expression via alternative pre-mRNA processing.

34839353	PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have shown clinical benefit in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, the immunotherapy strategy is less effective in patients with EGFR-activating mutations (EGFR MT). Studies showed that besides low expression of PD-L1, the absence of TILs and distinct expression profile of immune checkpoint molecules might be associated with low response of the patient subset. In this study, we first compared CD8A, GZMB and PRF1 mRNA levels in different LUAD subtypes harboring different driver mutations by dataset analyses and investigated the association between 15 well-defined B7-CD28 family members and driver mutations. The results showed that the decreases in the density and function of CD8(+) TILs, CD274 (PD-L1 gene), and CD86 and increases in VTCN1 (B7-H4 gene) and HHLA2 were associated with LUAD with EGFR-activating mutations. Immunohistochemical staining studies further supported that PD-L1 was downregulated and B7-H4 was upregulated in the subtype. Furthermore, PD-L1 expression was positively associated with levels of CD8A and granzyme B, while B7-H4 expression was negatively associated with granzyme B levels. In lung cancer cell lines, EGFR-activating mutations effectively upregulated B7-H4 and downregulated PD-L1. MEK/ERK-pathway activation upregulated B7-H4, and PI3K/Akt activation upregulated PD-L1. EGFR 19Del mutation was associated with inhibition of CD8(+) T-cell function, while knocking down B7-H4 could reverse the inhibition, and further showed tumor-growth inhibition and longer survival in vivo. Taken together, this study shed light on that B7-H4 might be an alternative immune-checkpoint molecule and a potential therapeutic target for LUAD with EGFR MT.

34749397	ADP-ribosylation factors (Arfs) are small GTPases regulating membrane traffic in the secretory pathway. They are closely related and appear to have overlapping functions, regulators, and effectors. The functional specificity of individual Arfs and the extent of redundancy are still largely unknown. We addressed these questions by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic deletion of the human class I (Arf1/3) and class II (Arf4/5) Arfs, either individually or in combination. Most knockout cell lines were viable with slight growth defects only when lacking Arf1 or Arf4. However, Arf1+4 and Arf4+5 could not be deleted simultaneously. Class I Arfs are nonessential, and Arf4 alone is sufficient for viability. Upon Arf1 deletion, the Golgi was enlarged, and recruitment of vesicle coats decreased, confirming a major role of Arf1 in vesicle formation at the Golgi. Knockout of Arf4 caused secretion of ER-resident proteins, indicating specific defects in coatomer-dependent ER protein retrieval by KDEL receptors. The knockout cell lines will be useful tools to study other Arf-dependent processes.	Shared and specific functions of Arfs 1-5 at the Golgi revealed by systematic knockouts.

34569685	Neuroinflammation is a common feature of many neurodegenerative diseases. It fosters a dysfunctional neuron-microglia-astrocyte crosstalk that, in turn, maintains microglial cells in a perniciously reactive state that often enhances neuronal damage. The molecular components that mediate this critical communication are not fully explored. Here, we show that secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1), a multifunctional regulator of cell-to-cell communication, is part of the cellular crosstalk underlying neuroinflammation. In mouse models of acute and chronic neuroinflammation, SFRP1, largely astrocyte-derived, promotes and sustains microglial activation, and thus a chronic inflammatory state. SFRP1 promotes the upregulation of components of the hypoxia-induced factor-dependent inflammatory pathway and, to a lower extent, of those downstream of the nuclear factor-kappa B. We thus propose that SFRP1 acts as an astrocyte-to-microglia amplifier of neuroinflammation, representing a potential valuable therapeutic target for counteracting the harmful effect of chronic inflammation in several neurodegenerative diseases.

34686334	Embryos repair wounds rapidly, with no inflammation or scarring, in a process that involves polarization of the actomyosin cytoskeleton. Actomyosin polarization results in the assembly of a contractile cable around the wound that drives wound closure. Here, we demonstrate that a contractile actomyosin cable is not sufficient for rapid wound repair in Drosophila embryos. We show that wounding causes activation of the serine/threonine kinase p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the cells adjacent to the wound. p38 activation reduces the levels of wound-induced reactive oxygen species in the cells around the wound, limiting wound size. In addition, p38 promotes an increase in volume in the cells around the wound, thus facilitating the collective cell movements that drive rapid wound healing. Our data indicate that p38 regulates cell volumes through the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter NKCC1. Our work reveals cell growth and cell survival as cell behaviors critical for embryonic wound repair.	p38-mediated cell growth and survival drive rapid embryonic wound repair.	Cell reports	1.0	0
34731632	Suppressive regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation is controlled by diverse immunometabolic signaling pathways and intracellular metabolites. Here we show that cell-permeable alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG) alters the DNA methylation profile of naive CD4 T cells activated under Treg polarizing conditions, markedly attenuating FoxP3+ Treg differentiation and increasing inflammatory cytokines. Adoptive transfer of these T cells into tumor-bearing mice results in enhanced tumor infiltration, decreased FoxP3 expression, and delayed tumor growth. Mechanistically, alphaKG leads to an energetic state that is reprogrammed toward a mitochondrial metabolism, with increased oxidative phosphorylation and expression of mitochondrial complex enzymes. Furthermore, carbons from ectopic alphaKG are directly utilized in the generation of fatty acids, associated with lipidome remodeling and increased triacylglyceride stores. Notably, inhibition of either mitochondrial complex II or DGAT2-mediated triacylglyceride synthesis restores Treg differentiation and decreases the alphaKG-induced inflammatory phenotype. Thus, we identify a crosstalk between alphaKG, mitochondrial metabolism and triacylglyceride synthesis that controls Treg fate.	Regulatory T cell differentiation is controlled by alphaKG-induced alterations in mitochondrial metabolism and lipid homeostasis.	Cell reports	0.0	0
34480896	Pheromone receptors (PRs) recognize specific pheromone compounds to guide the behavioral outputs of insects, which are the most diverse group of animals on earth. The activation of PRs is known to couple to the calcium permeability of their coreceptor (Orco) or putatively with G proteins; however, the underlying mechanisms of this process are not yet fully understood. Moreover, whether this transverse seven transmembrane domain (7TM)-containing receptor is able to couple to arrestin, a common effector for many conventional 7TM receptors, is unknown. Herein, using the PR BmOR3 from the silk moth Bombyx mori and its coreceptor BmOrco as a template, we revealed that an agonist-induced conformational change of BmOR3 was transmitted to BmOrco through transmembrane segment 7 from both receptors, resulting in the activation of BmOrco. Key interactions, including an ionic lock and a hydrophobic zipper, are essential in mediating the functional coupling between BmOR3 and BmOrco. BmOR3 also selectively coupled with Gi proteins, which was dispensable for BmOrco coupling. Moreover, we demonstrated that trans-7TM BmOR3 recruited arrestin in an agonist-dependent manner, which indicates an important role for BmOR3-BmOrco complex formation in ionotropic functions. Collectively, our study identified the coupling of G protein and arrestin to a prototype trans-7TM PR, BmOR3, and provided important mechanistic insights into the coupling of active PRs to their downstream effectors, including coreceptors, G proteins, and arrestin.

34875213	Mutations in PINK1 cause autosomal-recessive Parkinson's disease. Mitochondrial damage results in PINK1 import arrest on the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex, resulting in the activation of its ubiquitin kinase activity by autophosphorylation and initiation of Parkin-dependent mitochondrial clearance. Herein, we report crystal structures of the entire cytosolic domain of insect PINK1. Our structures reveal a dimeric autophosphorylation complex targeting phosphorylation at the invariant Ser205 (human Ser228). The dimer interface requires insert 2, which is unique to PINK1.

34497381	Aged bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) exhibit aberrant self-renewal and lineage specification, which contribute to imbalanced bone-fat and progressive bone loss. In addition to known master regulators of lineage commitment, it is crucial to identify pivotal switches governing the specific differentiation fate of aged BMSCs. Here, we profiled differences in epigenetic regulation between adipogenesis and osteogenesis and identified super-enhancer associated lncRNA nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) as a key bone-fat switch in aged BMSCs. We validated that NEAT1 with high enhancer activity was transcriptionally activated by ATF2 and directed aged BMSCs to a greater propensity to differentiate toward adipocytes than osteoblasts by mediating mitochondrial function. Furthermore, we confirmed NEAT1 as a protein-binding scaffold in which phosphorylation modification of SOX2 Ser249/250 by CDK2 impaired SOX2/OCT4 complex stability and dysregulated downstream transcription networks of pluripotency maintenance. In addition, by sponging miR-27b-3p, NEAT1 upregulated BNIP3L, BMP2K, and PPARG expression to shape mitochondrial function and osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation commitment, respectively. In extracellular communication, NEAT1 promoted CSF1 secretion from aged BMSCs and then strengthened osteoclastic differentiation by extracellular vesicle delivery. Notably, Neat1 small interfering RNA delivery induced increased bone mass in aged mice and decreased fat accumulation in the bone marrow. These findings suggest that NEAT1 regulates the lineage fates of BMSCs by orchestrating mitochondrial function and pluripotency maintenance, and might be a potential therapeutic target for skeletal aging.

Here, we introduce Anipose, an open-source toolkit for robust markerless 3D pose estimation.

It consists of four components: (1) a 3D calibration module, (2) filters to resolve 2D tracking errors, (3) a triangulation module that integrates temporal and spatial regularization, and (4) a pipeline to structure processing of large numbers of videos. We evaluate Anipose on a calibration board as well as mice, flies, and humans.

34852229	A common mechanism in inherited ataxia is a vulnerability of DNA damage. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a CAG-polyglutamine-repeat disorder characterized by cerebellar and retinal degeneration. Polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-7 protein incorporates into STAGA co-activator complex and interferes with transcription by altering histone acetylation. We performed chromatic immunoprecipitation sequencing ChIP-seq on cerebellum from SCA7 mice and observed increased H3K9-promoter acetylation in DNA repair genes, resulting in increased expression. After detecting increased DNA damage in SCA7 cells, mouse primary cerebellar neurons, and patient stem-cell-derived neurons, we documented reduced homology-directed repair (HDR) and single-strand annealing (SSA). To evaluate repair at endogenous DNA in native chromosome context, we modified linear amplification-mediated high-throughput genome-wide translocation sequencing and found that DNA translocations are less frequent in SCA7 models, consistent with decreased HDR and SSA. Altered DNA repair function in SCA7 may predispose the subject to excessive DNA damage, leading to neuron demise and highlights DNA repair as a therapy target.

34537243	Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) catalyze the charging of specific amino acids onto cognate tRNAs, an essential process for protein synthesis. Mutations in ARSs are frequently associated with a variety of human diseases. The human EPRS1 gene encodes a bifunctional glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS) with two catalytic cores and appended domains that contribute to nontranslational functions. In this study, we report compound heterozygous mutations in EPRS1, which lead to amino acid substitutions P14R and E205G in two patients with diabetes and bone diseases. While neither mutation affects tRNA binding or association of EPRS with the multisynthetase complex, E205G in the glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (ERS) region of EPRS is defective in amino acid activation and tRNA(Glu) charging. The P14R mutation induces a conformational change and altered tRNA charging kinetics in vitro. We propose that the altered catalytic activity and conformational changes in the EPRS variants sensitize patient cells to stress, triggering an increased integrated stress response (ISR) that diminishes cell viability. Indeed, patient-derived cells expressing the compound heterozygous EPRS show heightened induction of the ISR, suggestive of disruptions in protein homeostasis. These results have important implications for understanding ARS-associated human disease mechanisms and development of new therapeutics.

34511600	Mitochondria support multiple cell functions, but an accumulation of dysfunctional or excessive mitochondria is detrimental to cells. We previously demonstrated that a defect in the autophagic removal of mitochondria, termed mitophagy, leads to the acceleration of apoptosis induced by herpesvirus productive infection. However, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying activation of mitophagy and regulation of apoptosis remain poorly understood despite the identification of various mitophagy-associated proteins. Here, we report that the mitochondrial translation elongation factor Tu, a mitophagy-associated protein encoded by the TUFM gene, locates in part on the outer membrane of mitochondria (OMM) where it acts as an inhibitor of altered mitochondria-induced apoptosis through its autophagic function. Inducible depletion of TUFM potentiated caspase-8-mediated apoptosis in virus-infected cells with accumulation of altered mitochondria. In addition, TUFM depletion promoted caspase-8 activation induced by treatment with TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand in cancer cells, potentially via dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy. Importantly, we revealed the existence of and structural requirements for autophagy-competent TUFM on the OMM; the GxxxG motif within the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequences of TUFM was required for self-dimerization and mitophagy. Furthermore, we found that autophagy-competent TUFM was subject to ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation but stabilized upon mitophagy or autophagy activation. Moreover, overexpression of autophagy-competent TUFM could inhibit caspase-8 activation. These studies extend our knowledge of mitophagy regulation of apoptosis and could provide a novel strategic basis for targeted therapy of cancer and viral diseases.

35026226	The Saccharomyces cerevisiae PAH1-encoded phosphatidate (PA) phosphatase, which catalyzes the dephosphorylation of PA to produce diacylglycerol, controls the bifurcation of PA into triacylglycerol synthesis and phospholipid synthesis. Pah1 is inactive in the cytosol as a phosphorylated form and becomes active on the membrane as a dephosphorylated form by the Nem1-Spo7 protein phosphatase. We show that the conserved Trp-637 residue of Pah1, located in the intrinsically disordered region, is required for normal synthesis of membrane phospholipids, sterols, triacylglycerol, and the formation of lipid droplets. Analysis of mutant Pah1-W637A showed that the tryptophan residue is involved in the phosphorylation-mediated/dephosphorylation-mediated membrane association of the enzyme and its catalytic activity. The endogenous phosphorylation of Pah1-W637A was increased at the sites of the N-terminal region but was decreased at the sites of the C-terminal region. The altered phosphorylation correlated with an increase in its membrane association. In addition, membrane-associated PA phosphatase activity in vitro was elevated in cells expressing Pah1-W637A as a result of the increased membrane association of the mutant enzyme. However, the inherent catalytic function of Pah1 was not affected by the W637A mutation. Prediction of Pah1 structure by AlphaFold shows that Trp-637 and the catalytic residues Asp-398 and Asp-400 in the haloacid dehalogenase-like domain almost lie in the same plane, suggesting that these residues are important to properly position the enzyme for substrate recognition at the membrane surface. These findings underscore the importance of Trp-637 in Pah1 regulation by phosphorylation, membrane association of the enzyme, and its function in lipid synthesis.

35021072	MEK1 and MEK2, the only known activators of ERK, are attractive therapeutic candidates for both cancer and autoimmune diseases. However, how MEK signaling finely regulates immune cell activation is only partially understood. To address this question, we specifically delete Mek1 in hematopoietic cells in the Mek2 null background. Characterization of an allelic series of Mek mutants reveals the presence of distinct degrees of spontaneous B cell activation, which are inversely proportional to the levels of MEK proteins and ERK activation. While Mek1 and Mek2 null mutants have a normal lifespan, 1Mek1 and 1Mek2 mutants retaining only one functional Mek1 or Mek2 allele in hematopoietic cell lineages die from glomerulonephritis and lymphoproliferative disorders, respectively. This establishes that the fine-tuning of the ERK/MAPK pathway is critical to regulate B and T cell activation and function and that each MEK isoform plays distinct roles during lymphocyte activation and disease development.	Fine-tuning of MEK signaling is pivotal for limiting B and T cell activation.	Cell reports	0.0	0
34873283	Mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs) are implicated in diverse physiological processes-for example, mitochondrial quality control-and are linked to various neurodegenerative diseases. However, their specific cargo composition and complex molecular biogenesis are still unknown. Here we report the proteome and lipidome of steady-state TOMM20(+) MDVs. We identified 107 high-confidence MDV cargoes, which include all beta-barrel proteins and the TOM import complex. MDV cargoes are delivered as fully assembled complexes to lysosomes, thus representing a selective mitochondrial quality control mechanism for multi-subunit complexes, including the TOM machinery. Moreover, we define key biogenesis steps of phosphatidic acid-enriched MDVs starting with the MIRO1/2-dependent formation of thin membrane protrusions pulled along microtubule filaments, followed by MID49/MID51/MFF-dependent recruitment of the dynamin family GTPase DRP1 and finally DRP1-dependent scission. In summary, we define the function of MDVs in mitochondrial quality control and present a mechanistic model for global GTPase-driven MDV biogenesis.

34758320	CENP-A (centromeric protein A), a histone H3 variant, specifies centromere identity and is essential to centromere maintenance. Little is known about how protein levels of CENP-A are controlled in mammalian cells. Here, we report that the phosphorylation of CENP-A Ser68 primes the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated proteolysis of CENP-A during mitotic phase in human cultured cells. We identify two major polyubiquitination sites that are responsible for this phosphorylation-dependent degradation. Substituting the two residues, Lys49 and Lys124, with arginines abrogates proper CENP-A degradation and results in CENP-A mislocalization to non-centromeric regions. Furthermore, we find that DCAF11 (DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 11/WDR23) is the E3 ligase that specifically mediates the observed polyubiquitination. Deletion of DCAF11 hampers CENP-A degradation and causes its mislocalization. We conclude that the Ser68 phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating cellular CENP-A homeostasis via DCAF11-mediated degradation to prevent ectopic localization of CENP-A during the cell cycle.

34929172	Activated macrophages undergo metabolic reprogramming, which not only supports their energetic demands but also allows for the production of specific metabolites that function as signaling molecules. Several Krebs cycles, or Krebs-cycle-derived metabolites, including succinate, alpha-ketoglutarate, and itaconate, have recently been shown to modulate macrophage function. The accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) has also been well documented in transformed cells and more recently shown to play a role in T cell and dendritic cell function. Here we have found that the abundance of both enantiomers of 2HG is increased in LPS-activated macrophages. We show that L-2HG, but not D-2HG, can promote the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta and the adoption of an inflammatory, highly glycolytic metabolic state. These changes are likely mediated through activation of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) by L-2HG, a known inhibitor of the HIF prolyl hydroxylases. Expression of the enzyme responsible for L-2HG degradation, L-2HG dehydrogenase (L-2HGDH), was also found to be decreased in LPS-stimulated macrophages and may therefore also contribute to L-2HG accumulation. Finally, overexpression of L-2HGDH in HEK293 TLR4/MD2/CD14 cells inhibited HIF-1alpha activation by LPS, while knockdown of L-2HGDH in macrophages boosted the induction of HIF-1alpha-dependent genes, as well as increasing LPS-induced HIF-1alpha activity. Taken together, this study therefore identifies L-2HG as a metabolite that can regulate HIF-1alpha in macrophages.

34407442	The kinase domain transfers phosphate from ATP to substrates. However, the Legionella effector SidJ adopts a kinase fold, yet catalyzes calmodulin (CaM)-dependent glutamylation to inactivate the SidE ubiquitin ligases. The structural and mechanistic basis in which the kinase domain catalyzes protein glutamylation is unknown. Here we present cryo-EM reconstructions of SidJ:CaM:SidE reaction intermediate complexes. We show that the kinase-like active site of SidJ adenylates an active-site Glu in SidE, resulting in the formation of a stable reaction intermediate complex. An insertion in the catalytic loop of the kinase domain positions the donor Glu near the acyl-adenylate for peptide bond formation. Our structural analysis led us to discover that the SidJ paralog SdjA is a glutamylase that differentially regulates the SidE ligases during Legionella infection. Our results uncover the structural and mechanistic basis in which the kinase fold catalyzes non-ribosomal amino acid ligations and reveal an unappreciated level of SidE-family regulation.

34117376	Evasion of apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer, which is frequently mediated by upregulation of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins. In colorectal cancer (CRC), previous work has highlighted differential antiapoptotic protein dependencies determined by the stage of the disease. While intestinal stem cells (ISCs) require BCL-2 for adenoma outgrowth and survival during transformation, ISC-specific MCL1 deletion results in disturbed intestinal homeostasis, eventually contributing to tumorigenesis. Colon cancer stem cells (CSCs), however, no longer require BCL-2 and depend mainly on BCL-XL for their survival. We therefore hypothesized that a shift in antiapoptotic protein reliance occurs in ISCs as the disease progresses from normal to adenoma to carcinoma. By targeting antiapoptotic proteins with specific BH3 mimetics in organoid models of CRC progression, we found that BCL-2 is essential only during ISC transformation while MCL1 inhibition did not affect adenoma outgrowth. BCL-XL, on the other hand, was crucial for stem cell survival throughout the adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence. Furthermore, we identified that the limited window of BCL-2 reliance is a result of its downregulation by miR-17-5p, a microRNA that is upregulated upon APC-mutation driven transformation. Here we show that BCL-XL inhibition effectively impairs adenoma outgrowth in vivo and enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy. In line with this dependency, expression of BCL-XL, but not BCL-2 or MCL1, directly correlated to the outcome of chemotherapy-treated CRC patients. Our results provide insights to enable the rational use of BH3 mimetics in CRC management, particularly underlining the therapeutic potential of BCL-XL targeting mimetics in both early and late-stage disease.	BCL-XL is crucial for progression through the adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence of colorectal cancer.	Cell death and differentiation	3.0	1
34520759	Accumulation of alpha-synuclein is a main underlying pathological feature of Parkinson's disease and alpha-synucleinopathies, for which lowering expression of the alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA) is a potential therapeutic avenue. Using a cell-based luciferase reporter of SNCA expression we performed a quantitative high-throughput screen of 155,885 compounds and identified A-443654, an inhibitor of the multiple functional kinase AKT, as a potent inhibitor of SNCA. HEK-293 cells with CAG repeat expanded ATXN2 (ATXN2-Q58 cells) have increased levels of alpha-synuclein. We found that A-443654 normalized levels of both SNCA mRNA and alpha-synuclein monomers and oligomers in ATXN2-Q58 cells. A-443654 also normalized levels of alpha-synuclein in fibroblasts and iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons from a patient carrying a triplication of the SNCA gene. Analysis of autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress markers showed that A-443654 successfully prevented alpha-synuclein toxicity and restored cell function in ATXN2-Q58 cells, normalizing the levels of mTOR, LC3-II, p62, STAU1, BiP, and CHOP. A-443654 also decreased the expression of DCLK1, an inhibitor of alpha-synuclein lysosomal degradation. Our study identifies A-443654 and AKT inhibition as a potential strategy for reducing SNCA expression and treating Parkinson's disease pathology.

34582891	Obesity is a global health problem that is often related to cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Chronic low-grade inflammation in white adipose tissue (WAT) is a hallmark of obesity. Previously, during a search for differentially expressed genes in WAT of obese mice, we identified glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB), of which expression was robustly induced in pathologically expanded WAT. Here, we investigated the role of GPNMB in obesity-related metabolic disorders utilizing GPNMB-deficient mice. When fed a high-fat diet (HFD), GPNMB-deficient mice showed body weight and adiposity similar to those of wild-type (WT) mice. Nonetheless, insulin and glucose tolerance tests revealed significant obesity-related metabolic disorders in GPNMB-KO mice compared with WT mice fed with HFD. Chronic WAT inflammation was remarkably worsened in HFD-fed GPNMB-KO mice, accompanied by a striking increase in crown-like structures, typical hallmarks for diseased WAT. Macrophages isolated from GPNMB-KO mice were observed to produce more inflammatory cytokines than those of WT mice, a difference abolished by supplementation with recombinant soluble GPNMB extracellular domain. We demonstrated that GPNMB reduced the inflammatory capacity of macrophages by inhibiting NF-kappaB signaling largely through binding to CD44. Finally, we showed that macrophage depletion by addition of clodronate liposomes abolished the worsened WAT inflammation and abrogated the exacerbation of metabolic disorders in GPNMB-deficient mice fed on HFD. Our data reveal that GPNMB negatively regulates macrophage inflammatory capacities and ameliorates the WAT inflammation in obesity; therefore we conclude that GPNMB is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic disorders associated with obesity.	GPNMB plays a protective role against obesity-related metabolic disorders by reducing macrophage inflammatory capacity.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0.0	0
35077201	Mature myelin sheaths insulate axons to increase nerve conduction velocity and protect nerve fibers from stress and physical injury. In the peripheral nervous system, the myelin sheath is produced by Schwann cells. The guanine-nucleotide exchange factor cytohesin-2 activates the protein Arf6 to promote Schwann cell myelination. Here, we investigated the regulation of cytohesin-2 and found that the phosphorylation status of Tyr(381) in cytohesin-2 is central to Schwann cell myelination. Knockin mice with a nonphosphorylatable Y381F mutation in cytohesin-2 exhibited reduced myelin thickness and decreased Arf6 activity in sciatic nerve tissue. In HEK293T cells, cytohesin-2 was dephosphorylated at Tyr(381) by the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP4A1, whereas phosphorylation at this site was maintained by interaction with the adaptor protein SH2B1. Schwann cell-specific knockdown of PTP4A1 in mice increased cytohesin-2 phosphorylation and myelin thickness. Conversely, Schwann cell-specific loss of SH2B1 resulted in reduced myelin thickness and decreased cytohesin-2 phosphorylation. Thus, a signaling unit centered on cytohesin-2-with SH2B1 as a positive regulator and PTP4A1 as a negative regulator-controls Schwann cell myelination in the peripheral nervous system.	The adaptor SH2B1 and the phosphatase PTP4A1 regulate the phosphorylation of cytohesin-2 in myelinating Schwann cells in mice.	Science signaling	4.0	1
34990713	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen and a leading cause of chronic infection in the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis. After colonization, P. aeruginosa often undergoes a phenotypic conversion to mucoidy, characterized by overproduction of the alginate exopolysaccharide. This conversion is correlated with poorer patient prognoses. The majority of genes required for alginate synthesis, including the alginate lyase, algL, are located in a single operon. Previous investigations of AlgL have resulted in several divergent hypotheses regarding the protein's role in alginate production. To address these discrepancies, we determined the structure of AlgL and, using multiple sequence alignments, identified key active site residues involved in alginate binding and catalysis. In vitro enzymatic analysis of active site mutants highlights R249 and Y256 as key residues required for alginate lyase activity. In a genetically engineered P. aeruginosa strain where alginate biosynthesis is under arabinose control, we found that AlgL is required for cell viability and maintaining membrane integrity during alginate production. We demonstrate that AlgL functions as a homeostasis enzyme to clear the periplasmic space of accumulated polymer. Constitutive expression of the AlgU/T sigma factor mitigates the effects of an algL deletion during alginate production, suggesting that an AlgU/T-regulated protein or proteins can compensate for an algL deletion. Together, our study demonstrates the role of AlgL in alginate biosynthesis, explains the discrepancies observed previously across other P. aeruginosa DeltaalgL genetic backgrounds, and clarifies the existing divergent data regarding the function of AlgL as an alginate degrading enzyme.

34726332	The tumor suppressor protein BRCA1 plays an important role in DNA repair by homologous recombination. Despite being encoded by the first familial breast and ovarian cancer gene identified, how BRCA1 is recruited to sites of DNA damage to execute its repair functions has remained poorly understood. Several recent studies highlight the role of its constitutive interaction partner BARD1 in this process. In this issue, parallel work by Sherker et al (2021) focused on a second route of BRCA1 recruitment, connected to the BRCA1-A complex protein RAP80. Studying BRCA1 recruitment in RAP80-deficient cells exposed a critical role for the BRCA1 RING domain and its associated ubiquitin ligase activity. Given that tumors expressing RING-less BRCA1 isoforms can become resistant to therapy, targeting the RAP80 recruitment axis in such tumors might restore effective treatment.

34787651	The function of cellular structures at the mesoscale is dependent on their geometry and proportionality to cell size. The mitotic spindle is a good example why length and shape of intracellular organelles matter. Spindle length determines the distance over which chromosomes will segregate, and spindle shape ensures bipolarity. While we still lack a systematic and quantitative understanding of subcellular morphology, new imaging techniques and volumetric data analysis promise novel insights into scaling relations across different species. Here, we introduce Spindle3D, an open-source plug-in that allows for the quantitative, consistent, and automated analysis of 3D fluorescent data of spindles and chromatin. We systematically analyze different mammalian cell types, including somatic cells, stem cells, and one- and two-cell embryos, to derive volumetric relations of spindle, chromatin, and the cell. Taken together, our data indicate that mitotic spindle width is a robust indicator of spindle volume, which correlates linearly with chromatin and cell volume both within single cell types and across mammalian species.

34788620	Alternative splicing is a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism producing distinct mRNA molecules from a single pre-mRNA with a prominent role in the development and function of the central nervous system. We used long-read isoform sequencing to generate full-length transcript sequences in the human and mouse cortex. We identify novel transcripts not present in existing genome annotations, including transcripts mapping to putative novel (unannotated) genes and fusion transcripts incorporating exons from multiple genes. Global patterns of transcript diversity are similar between human and mouse cortex, although certain genes are characterized by striking differences between species. We also identify developmental changes in alternative splicing, with differential transcript usage between human fetal and adult cortex. Our data confirm the importance of alternative splicing in the cortex, dramatically increasing transcriptional diversity and representing an important mechanism underpinning gene regulation in the brain. We provide transcript-level data for human and mouse cortex as a resource to the scientific community.

34525373	Detailing how primate and mouse neurons differ is critical for creating generalized models of how neurons process information. We reconstruct 15,748 synapses in adult Rhesus macaques and mice and ask how connectivity differs on identified cell types in layer 2/3 of primary visual cortex. Primate excitatory and inhibitory neurons receive 2-5 times fewer excitatory and inhibitory synapses than similar mouse neurons. Primate excitatory neurons have lower excitatory-to-inhibitory (E/I) ratios than mouse but similar E/I ratios in inhibitory neurons. In both species, properties of inhibitory axons such as synapse size and frequency are unchanged, and inhibitory innervation of excitatory neurons is local and specific. Using artificial recurrent neural networks (RNNs) optimized for different cognitive tasks, we find that penalizing networks for creating and maintaining synapses, as opposed to neuronal firing, reduces the number of connections per node as the number of nodes increases, similar to primate neurons compared with mice.	Primate neuronal connections are sparse in cortex as compared to mouse.	Cell reports	0.0	0
35063098	Owing to their unique abilities to manipulate, label, and image individual molecules in vitro and in cellulo, single-molecule techniques provide previously unattainable access to elementary biological processes. In imaging, single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and protein-induced fluorescence enhancement in vitro can report on conformational changes and molecular interactions, single-molecule pull-down (SiMPull) can capture and analyze the composition and function of native protein complexes, and single-molecule tracking (SMT) in live cells reveals cellular structures and dynamics. In labeling, the abilities to specifically label genomic loci, mRNA, and nascent polypeptides in cells have uncovered chromosome organization and dynamics, transcription and translation dynamics, and gene expression regulation. In manipulation, optical tweezers, integration of single-molecule fluorescence with force measurements, and single-molecule force probes in live cells have transformed our mechanistic understanding of diverse biological processes, ranging from protein folding, nucleic acids-protein interactions to cell surface receptor function.

34787650	Proper cilia formation in multiciliated cells (MCCs) is necessary for appropriate embryonic development and homeostasis. Multicilia share many structural characteristics with monocilia and primary cilia, but there are still significant gaps in our understanding of the regulation of multiciliogenesis. Using the Xenopus embryo, we show that CEP97, which is known as a negative regulator of primary cilia formation, interacts with dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A (Dyrk1a) to modulate multiciliogenesis. We show that Dyrk1a phosphorylates CEP97, which in turn promotes the recruitment of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), which is a critical regulator of MCC maturation that functions to enhance centriole disengagement in cooperation with the enzyme Separase. Knockdown of either CEP97 or Dyrk1a disrupts cilia formation and centriole disengagement in MCCs, but this defect is rescued by overexpression of Separase. Thus, our study reveals that Dyrk1a and CEP97 coordinate with Plk1 to promote Separase function to properly form multicilia in vertebrate MCCs.	CEP97 phosphorylation by Dyrk1a is critical for centriole separation during multiciliogenesis.	The Journal of cell biology	2.5	1
34450162	The Split-Cre system is a powerful tool for genetic manipulation and can be used to spatiotemporally control gene expression in vivo. However, the low activity of the reconstituted NCre/CCre recombinase in the Split-Cre system limits its application as an indicator of the simultaneous expression of a pair of genes of interest. Here, we describe two approaches for improving the activity of the Split-Cre system after Cre reconstitution based on self-associating split GFP (Split-GFP) and SpyTag/SpyCatcher conjugation. First, we created the Split-GFP-Cre system by constructing fusion proteins of NCre and CCre with the N-terminal and C-terminal subunits of GFP, respectively. Reconstitution of Cre by GFP-mediated dimerization of the two fusion proteins resulted in recombinase activity approaching that of full-length Cre in living cells. Second, to further increase recombinase activity at low levels of Split-Cre expression, the Split-Spy-GCre system was established by incorporating the sequences for SpyTag and SpyCatcher into the components of the Split-GFP-Cre system. As anticipated, covalent conjugation of the SpyTag and SpyCatcher segments improved Split-GFP dimerization to further increase Cre recombinase activity in living cells. The increased efficiency and robustness of this dual-split system (Split-Cre and Split-GFP) minimize the problems of incomplete double gene-specific KO or low labeling efficiency due to poor NCre/CCre recombinase activity. Thus, this Split-Spy-GCre system allows more precise gene manipulation of cell subpopulations, which will provide advanced analysis of genes and cell functions in complex tissue such as the immune system.

34551305	To maintain secretory pathway fidelity, misfolded proteins are commonly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and selected for ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Soluble misfolded proteins use ER chaperones for retention, but the machinery that restricts aberrant membrane proteins to the ER is unclear. In fact, some misfolded membrane proteins escape the ER and traffic to the lysosome/vacuole. To this end, we describe a model substrate, SZ( *), that contains an ER export signal but is also targeted for ERAD. We observe decreased ER retention when chaperone-dependent SZ( *) ubiquitination is compromised. In addition, appending a linear tetra-ubiquitin motif onto SZ( *) overrides ER export. By screening known ubiquitin-binding proteins, we then positively correlate SZ( *) retention with Ubx2 binding. Deletion of Ubx2 also inhibits the retention of another misfolded membrane protein. Our results indicate that polyubiquitination is sufficient to retain misfolded membrane proteins in the ER prior to ERAD.

34650217	Aberrant glucose metabolism and elevated O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine modification (O-GlcNAcylation) are hallmarks of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Loss of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1), the major rate-limiting enzyme of hepatic gluconeogenesis, increases hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP)-mediated protein O-GlcNAcylation in hepatoma cell and promotes cell growth and proliferation. However, whether PCK1 deficiency and hyper O-GlcNAcylation can induce HCC metastasis is largely unknown. Here, gain- and loss-of-function studies demonstrate that PCK1 suppresses HCC metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, lysine acetyltransferase 5 (KAT5), belonging to the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases (HAT), is highly modified by O-GlcNAcylation in PCK1 knockout hepatoma cells. Mechanistically, PCK1 depletion suppressed KAT5 ubiquitination by increasing its O-GlcNAcylation, thereby stabilizing KAT5. KAT5 O-GlcNAcylation epigenetically activates TWIST1 expression via histone H4 acetylation, and enhances MMP9 and MMP14 expression via c-Myc acetylation, thus promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC. In addition, targeting HBP-mediated O-GlcNAcylation of KAT5 inhibits lung metastasis of HCC in hepatospecific Pck1-deletion mice. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that PCK1 depletion increases O-GlcNAcylation of KAT5, epigenetically induces TWIST1 expression and promotes HCC metastasis, and link metabolic enzyme, post-translational modification (PTM) with epigenetic regulation.	O-GlcNAc modified-TIP60/KAT5 is required for PCK1 deficiency-induced HCC metastasis.	Oncogene	3.0	1
34969962	Loss of alveolar type 2 cells (AEC2s) and the ectopic appearance of basal cells in the alveoli characterize severe lung injuries such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Here we demonstrate that human alveolar type 2 cells (hAEC2s), unlike murine AEC2s, transdifferentiate into basal cells in response to fibrotic signalling in the lung mesenchyme, in vitro and in vivo. Single-cell analysis of normal hAEC2s and mesenchymal cells in organoid co-cultures revealed the emergence of pathologic fibroblasts and basaloid cells previously described in IPF. Transforming growth factor-beta1 and anti-bone morphogenic protein signalling in the organoids promoted transdifferentiation. Trajectory and histologic analyses of both hAEC2-derived organoids and IPF epithelium indicated that hAEC2s transdifferentiate into basal cells through alveolar-basal intermediates that accumulate in proximity to pathologic CTHRC1(hi)/TGFB1(hi) fibroblasts. Our study indicates that hAEC2 loss and expansion of alveolar metaplastic basal cells in severe human lung injuries are causally connected through an hAEC2-basal cell lineage trajectory driven by aberrant mesenchyme.

34965417	Germline pathogenic mutations in BReast CAncer (BRCA1) genes are thought to drive normal fallopian tube epithelial (FTE) cell transformation to high-grade serous ovarian cancer. No human models capture the sequence of events for disease initiation and progression. Here, we generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from healthy individuals and young ovarian cancer patients with germline pathogenic BRCA1 mutations (BRCA1(mut)). Following differentiation into FTE organoids, BRCA1(mut) lines exhibit cellular abnormalities consistent with neoplastic transformation compared to controls. BRCA1(mut) organoids show an increased production of cancer-specific proteins and survival following transplantation into mice. Organoids from women with the most aggressive ovarian cancer show the greatest pathology, indicating the potential value to predict clinical severity prior to disease onset. These human FTE organoids from BRCA1(mut) carriers provide a faithful physiological in vitro model of FTE lesion generation and early carcinogenesis.

34998825	Obesity is a risk factor for insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Reticulon-4 (Nogo) is an endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein with unclear functions in obesity. Herein, we investigated the effect of Nogo on obesity and associated metabolic disorders. Human serum samples were collected to explore the relationship between circulating Nogo-B and body mass index value. Nogo-deficient and WT littermate control mice were fed normal chow or high-fat diet (HFD) for 14 weeks, and HFD-induced obese C57BL/6J mice were injected scrambled or Nogo siRNA for 2 weeks. We found that in human and mouse serum, Nogo-B was positively correlated to body mass index/bodyweight and lipid profiles. Reduced Nogo (by genetic deletion or siRNA transfection) protected mice against HFD-induced obesity and related metabolic disorders. We demonstrate that Nogo deficiency reversed HFD-induced whitening of brown adipose tissue, thereby increasing thermogenesis. It also ameliorated lipid accumulation in tissues by activating the adiponectin-adiponectin receptor 1-AMP-activated kinase alpha signaling axis. Finally, Nogo deficiency potently reduced HFD-induced serum proinflammatory cytokines and infiltration of macrophages into metabolic organs, which is related to enhanced NF-kappaB p65 degradation via the lysosome pathway. Collectively, our study suggests that reduced levels of Nogo protect mice against HFD-induced obesity by increasing thermogenesis and energy metabolism while inhibiting NF-kappaB-mediated inflammation. Our results indicate that inhibition of Nogo may be a potential strategy for obesity treatment.

34788622	The global impact of somatic structural variants (SVs) on gene regulation in advanced tumors with complex treatment histories has been mostly uncharacterized. Here, using whole-genome and RNA sequencing from 570 recurrent or metastatic tumors, we report the altered expression of hundreds of genes in association with nearby SV breakpoints, including oncogenes and G-protein-coupled receptor-related genes such as PLEKHG2. A significant fraction of genes with SV-expression associations correlate with worse patient survival in primary and advanced cancers, including SRD5A1. In many instances, SV-expression associations involve retrotransposons being translocated near genes. High overall SV burden is associated with treatment with DNA alkylating agents or taxanes and altered expression of metabolism-associated genes. SV-expression associations within tumors from topoisomerase I inhibitor-treated patients include chromatin-related genes. Within anthracycline-treated tumors, SV breakpoints near chromosome 1p genes include PDE4B. Patient treatment and history can help understand the widespread SV-mediated cis-regulatory alterations found in cancer.

34655613	Mint3 is known to enhance aerobic ATP production, known as the Warburg effect, by binding to FIH-1. Since this effect is considered to be beneficial for cancer cells, the interaction is a promising target for cancer therapy. However, previous research has suggested that the interacting region of Mint3 with FIH-1 is intrinsically disordered, which makes investigation of this interaction challenging. Therefore, we adopted thermodynamic and structural studies in solution to clarify the structural and thermodynamical changes of Mint3 binding to FIH-1. First, using a combination of circular dichroism, nuclear magnetic resonance, and hydrogen/deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), we confirmed that the N-terminal half, which is the interacting part of Mint3, is mostly disordered. Next, we revealed a large enthalpy and entropy change in the interaction of Mint3 using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The profile is consistent with the model that the flexibility of disordered Mint3 is drastically reduced upon binding to FIH-1. Moreover, we performed a series of ITC experiments with several types of truncated Mint3s, an effective approach since the interacting part of Mint3 is disordered, and identified amino acids 78 to 88 as a novel core site for binding to FIH-1. The truncation study of Mint3 also revealed the thermodynamic contribution of each part of Mint3 to the interaction with FIH-1, where the core sites contribute to the affinity (DeltaG), while other sites only affect enthalpy (DeltaH), by forming noncovalent bonds. This insight can serve as a foothold for further investigation of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and drug development for cancer therapy.

34588619	The therapeutic efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is often reduced by the development of drug resistance. We observed significant upregulation of lipocalin 2 (LCN2) expression in a newly established 5-FU-resistant colorectal cancer (CRC) cell line. In this study, we demonstrated that 5-FU-treated CRC cells developed resistance through LCN2 upregulation caused by LCN2 promoter demethylation and that feedback between LCN2 and NF-kappaB further amplified LCN2 expression. High LCN2 expression was associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients. LCN2 attenuated the cytotoxicity of 5-FU by activating the SRC/AKT/ERK-mediated antiapoptotic program. Mechanistically, the LCN2-integrin beta3 interaction enhanced integrin beta3 stability, thus recruiting SRC to the cytomembrane for autoactivation, leading to downstream AKT/ERK cascade activation. Targeting LCN2 or SRC compromised the growth of CRC cells with LCN2-induced 5-FU resistance. Our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism of acquired resistance to 5-FU, suggesting that LCN2 can be used as a biomarker and/or therapeutic target for advanced CRC.

34079078	The blockade of cellular differentiation represents a hallmark of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is largely attributed to the dysfunction of lineage-specific transcription factors controlling cellular differentiation. However, alternative mechanisms of cellular differentiation programs in AML remain largely unexplored. Here we report that mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) contributes to the cellular differentiation of transformed hematopoietic progenitor cells in AML. Using gene-targeted mice, we show that MLKL facilitates the release of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) by controlling membrane permeabilization in leukemic cells. Mlkl(-/-) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells released reduced amounts of G-CSF while retaining their capacity for CSF3 (G-CSF) mRNA expression, G-CSF protein translation, and G-CSF receptor signaling. MLKL associates with early endosomes and controls G-CSF release from intracellular storage by plasma membrane pore formation, whereas cell death remained unaffected by loss of MLKL. Of note, MLKL expression was significantly reduced in AML patients, specifically in those with a poor-risk AML subtype. Our data provide evidence that MLKL controls myeloid differentiation in AML by controlling the release of G-CSF from leukemic progenitor cells.

34929165	Recognition of human autophagy-related 8 (hATG8) proteins by autophagy receptors represents a critical step within this cellular quality control system. Autophagy impairment is known to be a pathogenic mechanism in the motor neuron disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Overlapping but specific roles of hATG8 proteins belonging to the LC3 and GABARAP subfamilies are incompletely understood, and binding selectivity is typically overlooked. We previously showed that an ALS-associated variant of the SQSTM1/p62 (p62) autophagy receptor bearing an L341V mutation within its ATG8-interacting motif (AIM) impairs recognition of LC3B in vitro, yielding an autophagy-deficient phenotype. Improvements in understanding of hATG8 recognition by AIMs now distinguish LC3-interaction and GABARAP-interaction motifs and predict the effects of L341V substitution may extend beyond loss of function to biasing AIM binding preference. Through biophysical analyses, we confirm impaired binding of the L341V-AIM mutant to LC3A, LC3B, GABARAP, and GABARAPL1. In contrast, p62 AIM interactions with LC3C and GABARAPL2 are unaffected by this mutation. Isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR investigations provided insights into the entropy-driven GABARAPL2/p62 interaction and how the L341V mutation may be tolerated. Competition binding demonstrated reduced association of the L341V-AIM with one hATG8 manifests as a relative increase in association with alternate hATG8s, indicating effective reprogramming of hATG8 selectivity. These data highlight how a single AIM peptide might compete for binding with different hATG8s and suggest that the L341V-AIM mutation may be neomorphic, representative of a disease mechanism that likely extends into other human disorders.

34582888	Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP) is a core component of the N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-methyltransferase complex, along with VIRMA, CBLL1, ZC3H13 (KIAA0853), RBM15/15B, and METTL3/14, which generate m6A, a key RNA modification that affects various processes of RNA metabolism. WTAP also interacts with splicing factors; however, despite strong evidence suggesting a role of Drosophila WTAP homolog fl(2)d in alternative splicing (AS), its role in splicing regulation in mammalian cells remains elusive. Here we demonstrate using RNAi coupled with RNA-seq that WTAP, VIRMA, CBLL1, and ZC3H13 modulate AS, promoting exon skipping and intron retention in AS events that involve short introns/exons with higher GC content and introns with weaker polypyrimidine-tract and branch points. Further analysis of GC-rich sequences involved in AS events regulated by WTAP, together with minigene assay analysis, revealed potential G-quadruplex formation at splice sites where WTAP has an inhibitory effect. We also found that several AS events occur in the last exon of one isoform of MSL1 and WTAP, leading to competition for polyadenylation. Proteomic analysis also suggested that WTAP/CBLL1 interaction promotes recruitment of the 3'-end processing complex. Taken together, our results indicate that the WTAP complex regulates AS and alternative polyadenylation via inhibitory mechanisms in GC-rich sequences.

34650218	MYC is a prolific proto-oncogene driving the malignant behaviors of numerous common cancers, yet potent and selective cell-permeable inhibitors of MYC remain elusive. In order to ultimately realize the goal of therapeutic MYC inhibition in cancer, we have initiated discovery chemistry efforts aimed at inhibiting MYC translation. Here we describe a series of conformationally stabilized synthetic antisense oligonucleotides designed to target MYC mRNA (MYCASOs). To support bioactivity, we designed and synthesized this focused library of MYCASOs incorporating locked nucleic acid (LNA) bases at the 5'- and 3'-ends, a phosphorothioate backbone, and internal DNA bases. Treatment of MYC-expressing cancer cells with MYCASOs leads to a potent decrease in MYC mRNA and protein levels. Cleaved MYC mRNA in MYCASO-treated cells is detected with a sensitive 5' Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) assay. MYCASO treatment of cancer cell lines leads to significant inhibition of cellular proliferation while specifically perturbing MYC-driven gene expression signatures. In a MYC-induced model of hepatocellular carcinoma, MYCASO treatment decreases MYC protein levels within tumors, decreases tumor burden, and improves overall survival. MYCASOs represent a new chemical tool for in vitro and in vivo modulation of MYC activity, and promising therapeutic agents for MYC-addicted tumors.

34627839	Zinc deficiency has been linked to human diseases, including cancer. MDMX, a crucial zinc-containing negative regulator of p53, has been found to be amplified or overexpressed in various cancers and implicated in the cancer initiation and progression. We report here that zinc depletion by the ion chelator TPEN or Chelex resin results in MDMX protein degradation in a ubiquitination-independent and 20S proteasome-dependent manner. Restoration of zinc led to recovery of cellular levels of MDMX. Further, TPEN treatment inhibits growth of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, which is partially rescued by overexpression of MDMX. Moreover, in a mass-spectrometry-based proteomics analysis, we identified TRPM7, a zinc-permeable ion channel, as a novel MDMX-interacting protein. TRPM7 stabilizes and induces the appearance of faster migrating species of MDMX on SDS-PAGE. Depletion of TRPM7 attenuates, while TRPM7 overexpression facilitates, the recovery of MDMX levels upon adding back zinc to TPEN-treated cells. Importantly, we found that TRPM7 inhibition, like TPEN treatment, decreases breast cancer cell MCF-7 proliferation and migration. The inhibitory effect on cell migration upon TRPM7 inhibition is also partially rescued by overexpression of MDMX. Together, our data indicate that TRPM7 regulates cellular levels of MDMX in part by modulating the intracellular Zn(2+) concentration to promote tumorigenesis.

34693625	TNF stimulation generates pro-survival signals through activation of NF-kappaB that restrict the build-in death signaling triggered by TNF. The competition between TNF-induced survival and death signals ultimately determines the fate of a cell. Here, we report the identification of Bclaf1 as a novel component of the anti-apoptotic program of TNF. Bclaf1 depletion in multiple cells sensitizes cells to TNF-induced apoptosis but not to necroptosis. Bclaf1 exerts its anti-apoptotic function by promoting the transcription of CFLAR, a caspase 8 antagonist, downstream of NF-kappaB activation. Bclaf1 binds to the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB, which is required for Bclaf1 to stimulate CFLAR transcription. Finally, in Bclaf1 siRNA administered mice, TNF-induced small intestine injury is much more severe than in control mice with aggravated signs of apoptosis and pyroptosis. These results suggest Bclaf1 is a key regulator in TNF-induced apoptosis, both in vitro and in vivo.

34534548	Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) fulfills various physiological roles that are unrelated to its glycolytic function. However, to date, the nonglycolytic function of GAPDH in trypanosomal parasites is absent from the literature. Exosomes secreted from Leishmania, like entire parasites, were found to have a significant impact on macrophage cell signaling and function, indicating cross talk with the host immune system. In this study, we demonstrate that the Leishmania GAPDH (LmGAPDH) protein is highly enriched within the extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted during infection. To understand the function of LmGAPDH in EVs, we generated control, overexpressed, half-knockout (HKO), and complement cell lines. HKO cells displayed lower virulence compared with control cells when macrophages and BALB/c mice were infected with them, implying a crucial role for LmGAPDH in Leishmania infection and disease progression. Furthermore, upon infection of macrophages with HKO mutant Leishmania and its EVs, despite no differences in TNFA mRNA expression, there was a considerable increase in TNF-alpha protein expression compared with control, overexpressed, and complement parasites as determined by ELISA, RT-PCR, and immunoblot data. In vitro protein translation studies suggest that LmGAPDH-mediated TNF-alpha suppression occurs in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, mRNA binding assays also verified that LmGAPDH binds to the AU-rich 3'-UTR region of TNFA mRNA, limiting its production. Together, these findings confirmed that the LmGAPDH contained in EVs inhibits TNF-alpha expression in macrophages during infection via posttranscriptional repression.

34800438	Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of midbrain dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. Mutations in the F-box only protein 7 gene (Fbxo7) have been reported to cause an autosomal recessive form of early-onset familial PD. FBXO7 is a part of the SKP1-Cullin1-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which mediates ubiquitination of numerous substrates. FBXO7 also regulates mitophagy, cell growth, and proteasome activity. A member of the FOXO family, the transcription factor FOXO4, is also known to modulate several cellular responses, including cell cycle progression and apoptosis; however, the relationship between FBXO7 and FOXO4 has not been investigated. In this study, we determined that FBXO7 binds to FOXO4 and negatively regulates intracellular FOXO4 levels. Interestingly, we also found that FBXO7-mediated degradation of FOXO4 did not occur through either of two major proteolysis systems, the ubiquitin-proteasome system or the lysosome-autophagy pathway, although it was blocked by a caspase 8-specific inhibitor and caspase 8-knockdown. Moreover, intracellular FOXO4 levels were greatly reduced in dopaminergic MN9D cells following treatment with neurotoxic 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), which was produced upon FBXO7-mediated and caspase 8-mediated proteolysis. Taken together, these results suggest that FOXO4 is negatively regulated in FBXO7-linked PD through caspase 8 activation, suppressing the cytoprotective effect of FOXO4 during 6-OHDA-induced neuronal cell death.

34686324	Optical methods for measuring intracellular ions including Ca(2+) revolutionized our understanding of signal transduction. However, these methods are not extensively applied to intact organs due to issues including inner filter effects, motion, and available probes. Mitochondrial Ca(2+) is postulated to regulate cell energetics and death pathways that are best studied in an intact organ. Here, we develop a method to optically measure mitochondrial Ca(2+) and demonstrate its validity for mitochondrial Ca(2+) and metabolism using hearts from wild-type mice and mice with germline knockout of the mitochondria calcium uniporter (MCU-KO). We previously reported that germline MCU-KO hearts do not show an impaired response to adrenergic stimulation. We find that these MCU-KO hearts do not take up Ca(2+), consistent with no alternative Ca(2+) uptake mechanisms in the absence of MCU. This approach can address the role of mitochondrial Ca(2+) to the myriad of functions attributed to alterations in mitochondrial Ca(2+).

35063132	The envelope of Gram-negative bacteria is a vital barrier that must balance protection and nutrient uptake. Small RNAs are crucial regulators of the envelope composition and function. Here, using RIL-seq to capture the Hfq-mediated RNA-RNA interactome in Salmonella enterica, we discover envelope-related riboregulators, including OppX. We show that OppX acts as an RNA sponge of MicF sRNA, a prototypical porin repressor. OppX originates from the 5' UTR of oppABCDF, encoding the major inner-membrane oligopeptide transporter, and sequesters MicF's seed region to derepress the synthesis of the porin OmpF. Intriguingly, OppX operates as a true sponge, storing MicF in an inactive complex without affecting its levels or stability. Conservation of the opp-OppX-MicF-ompF axis in related bacteria suggests that it serves an important mechanism, adjusting envelope porosity to specific transport capacity. These data also highlight the resource value of this Salmonella RNA interactome, which will aid in unraveling RNA-centric regulation in enteric pathogens.

34496256	"Many bacterial pathogens secrete A(2)B5 toxins comprising two functionally distinct yet complementary ""A"" and ""B"" subunits to benefit the pathogens during infection. The lectin-like pentameric B subunits recognize specific sets of host glycans to deliver the toxin into target host cells. Here, we offer the molecular mechanism by which neutralizing antibodies, which have the potential to bind to all glycan-receptor binding sites and thus completely inhibit toxin binding to host cells, are inhibited from exerting this action. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM)-based analyses indicate that the skewed positioning of the toxin A subunit(s) toward one side of the toxin B pentamer inhibited neutralizing antibody binding to the laterally located epitopes, rendering some glycan-receptor binding sites that remained available for the toxin binding and endocytosis process, which is strikingly different from the counterpart antibodies recognizing the far side-located epitopes. These results highlight additional features of the toxin-antibody interactions and offer important insights into anti-toxin strategies."

34592134	Protein ADP-ribosylation is a reversible post-translational modification that transfers ADP-ribose from NAD(+) onto acceptor proteins. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation), catalyzed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) and poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolases (PARGs), which remove the modification, regulates diverse cellular processes. However, the chemistry and physiological functions of mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation (MARylation) remain elusive. Here, we report that Arabidopsis zinc finger proteins SZF1 and SZF2, key regulators of immune gene expression, are MARylated by the noncanonical ADP-ribosyltransferase SRO2. Immune elicitation promotes MARylation of SZF1/SZF2 via dissociation from PARG1, which has an unconventional activity in hydrolyzing both poly(ADP-ribose) and mono(ADP-ribose) from acceptor proteins. MARylation antagonizes polyubiquitination of SZF1 mediated by the SH3 domain-containing proteins SH3P1/SH3P2, thereby stabilizing SZF1 proteins. Our study uncovers a noncanonical ADP-ribosyltransferase mediating MARylation of immune regulators and underpins the molecular mechanism of maintaining protein homeostasis by the counter-regulation of ADP-ribosylation and polyubiquitination to ensure proper immune responses.

34762851	Variability in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 disease severity between individuals is partly due to genetic factors. Here, we identify 4 genomic loci with suggestive associations for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and 19 for COVID-19 disease severity. Four of these 23 loci likely have an ethnicity-specific component. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals in 11 loci colocalize with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) associated with the expression of 20 genes in 62 tissues/cell types (range: 1:43 tissues/gene), including lung, brain, heart, muscle, and skin as well as the digestive system and immune system. We perform genetic fine mapping to compute 99% credible SNP sets, which identify 10 GWAS loci that have eight or fewer SNPs in the credible set, including three loci with one single likely causal SNP. Our study suggests that the diverse symptoms and disease severity of COVID-19 observed between individuals is associated with variants across the genome, affecting gene expression levels in a wide variety of tissue types.

34942148	Melanin is a major virulence factor in pathogenic fungi that enhances the ability of fungal cells to resist immune clearance. Cryptococcus neoformans is an important human pathogenic fungus that synthesizes melanin from exogenous tissue catecholamine precursors during infection, but the type of melanin made in cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is unknown. We analyzed the efficacy of various catecholamines found in brain tissue in supporting melanization using animal brain tissue and synthetic catecholamine mixtures reflecting brain tissue proportions. Solid-state NMR spectra of the melanin pigment produced from such mixtures yielded more melanin than expected if only the preferred constituent dopamine had been incorporated, suggesting uptake of additional catecholamines. Probing the biosynthesis of melanin using radiolabeled catecholamines revealed that C. neoformans melanization simultaneously incorporated more than one catecholamine, implying that the pigment was polytypic in nature. Nonetheless, melanin derived from individual or mixed catecholamines had comparable ability to protect C. neoformans against ultraviolet light and oxidants. Our results indicate that melanin produced during infection differs depending on the catecholamine composition of tissue and that melanin pigment synthesized in vivo is likely to accrue from the polymerization of a mixture of precursors. From a practical standpoint, our results strongly suggest that using dopamine as a polymerization precursor is capable of producing melanin pigment comparable to that produced during infection. On a more fundamental level, our findings uncover additional structural complexity for natural cryptococcal melanin by demonstrating that pigment produced during human infection is likely to be composed of polymerized moieties derived from chemically different precursors.

34688659	Eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A)(dagger,double dagger) is an essential protein that requires a unique amino acid, hypusine, for its activity. Hypusine is formed exclusively in eIF5A post-translationally via two enzymes, deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase. Each of the genes encoding these proteins, Eif5a, Dhps, and Dohh, is required for mouse embryonic development. Variants in EIF5A or DHPS were recently identified as the genetic basis underlying certain rare neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. To investigate the roles of eIF5A and DHPS in brain development, we generated four conditional KO mouse strains using the Emx1-Cre or Camk2a-Cre strains and examined the effects of temporal- and region-specific deletion of Eif5a or Dhps. The conditional deletion of Dhps or Eif5a by Emx1 promotor-driven Cre expression (E9.5, in the cortex and hippocampus) led to gross defects in forebrain development, reduced growth, and premature death. On the other hand, the conditional deletion of Dhps or Eif5a by Camk2a promoter-driven Cre expression (postnatal, mainly in the CA1 region of the hippocampus) did not lead to global developmental defects; rather, these KO animals exhibited severe impairment in spatial learning, contextual learning, and memory when subjected to the Morris water maze and a contextual learning test. In both models, the Dhps-KO mice displayed more severe impairment than their Eif5a-KO counterparts. The observed defects in the brain, global development, or cognitive functions most likely result from translation errors due to a deficiency in active, hypusinated eIF5A. Our study underscores the important roles of eIF5A and DHPS in neurodevelopment.

34461093	In most organisms, transition metal ions are necessary cofactors of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), the enzyme responsible for biosynthesis of the 2'-deoxynucleotide building blocks of DNA. The metal ion generates an oxidant for an active site cysteine (Cys), yielding a thiyl radical that is necessary for initiation of catalysis in all RNRs. Class I enzymes, widespread in eukaryotes and aerobic microbes, share a common requirement for dioxygen in assembly of the active Cys oxidant and a unique quaternary structure, in which the metallo- or radical-cofactor is found in a separate subunit, beta, from the catalytic alpha subunit. The first class I RNRs, the class Ia enzymes, discovered and characterized more than 30 years ago, were found to use a diiron(III)-tyrosyl-radical Cys oxidant. Although class Ia RNRs have historically served as the model for understanding enzyme mechanism and function, more recently, remarkably diverse bioinorganic and radical cofactors have been discovered in class I RNRs from pathogenic microbes. These enzymes use alternative transition metal ions, such as manganese, or posttranslationally installed tyrosyl radicals for initiation of ribonucleotide reduction. Here we summarize the recent progress in discovery and characterization of novel class I RNR radical-initiating cofactors, their mechanisms of assembly, and how they might function in the context of the active class I holoenzyme complex.

34860252	Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling plays a fundamental role in metazoan development and tissue homeostasis. However, the molecular mechanisms concerning the ubiquitin-related dynamic regulation of TGF-beta signaling are not thoroughly understood. Using a combination of proteomics and an siRNA screen, we identify pVHL as an E3 ligase for SMAD3 ubiquitination. We show that pVHL directly interacts with conserved lysine and proline residues in the MH2 domain of SMAD3, triggering degradation. As a result, the level of pVHL expression negatively correlates with the expression and activity of SMAD3 in cells, Drosophila wing, and patient tissues. In Drosophila, loss of pVHL leads to the up-regulation of TGF-beta targets visible in a downward wing blade phenotype, which is rescued by inhibition of SMAD activity. Drosophila pVHL expression exhibited ectopic veinlets and reduced wing growth in a similar manner as upon loss of TGF-beta/SMAD signaling. Thus, our study demonstrates a conserved role of pVHL in the regulation of TGF-beta/SMAD3 signaling in human cells and Drosophila wing development.	pVHL-mediated SMAD3 degradation suppresses TGF-beta signaling.

34913963	"The physiological mechanisms driving synapse formation are elusive. Although numerous signals are known to regulate synapses, it remains unclear which signaling mechanisms organize initial synapse assembly. Here, we describe new tools, referred to as ""SynTAMs"" for synaptic targeting molecules, that enable localized perturbations of cAMP signaling in developing postsynaptic specializations. We show that locally restricted suppression of postsynaptic cAMP levels or of cAMP-dependent protein-kinase activity severely impairs excitatory synapse formation without affecting neuronal maturation, dendritic arborization, or inhibitory synapse formation. In vivo, suppression of postsynaptic cAMP signaling in CA1 neurons prevented formation of both Schaffer-collateral and entorhinal-CA1/temporoammonic-path synapses, suggesting a general principle. Retrograde trans-synaptic rabies virus tracing revealed that postsynaptic cAMP signaling is required for continuous replacement of synapses throughout life. Given that postsynaptic latrophilin adhesion-GPCRs drive synapse formation and produce cAMP, we suggest that spatially restricted postsynaptic cAMP signals organize assembly of postsynaptic specializations during synapse formation."

34890643	The diversity of glycerophospholipid species in cellular membranes is immense and affects various biological functions. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (GPATs) and lysophospholipid acyltransferases (LPLATs), in concert with phospholipase A1/2s enzymes, contribute to this diversity via selective esterification of fatty acyl chains at the sn-1 or sn-2 positions of membrane phospholipids. These enzymes are conserved across all kingdoms, and in mammals four GPATs of the 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase (AGPAT) family and at least 14 LPLATs, either of the AGPAT or the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) families, have been identified. Here we provide an overview of the biochemical and biological activities of these mammalian enzymes, including their predicted structures, involvements in human diseases, and essential physiological roles as revealed by gene-deficient mice. Recently, the nomenclature used to refer to these enzymes has generated some confusion due to the use of multiple names to refer to the same enzyme and instances of the same name being used to refer to completely different enzymes. Thus, this review proposes a more uniform LPLAT enzyme nomenclature, as well as providing an update of recent advances made in the study of LPLATs, continuing from our JBC mini review in 2009.

34965440	"Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) is an angiogenesis-inducing oncovirus whose ability to usurp the oxygen-sensing machinery is central to its oncogenicity. By upregulating the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), KSHV reprograms infected cells to a hypoxia-like state, triggering angiogenesis. Here we identify a link between KSHV replicative biology and oncogenicity by showing that KSHV's ability to regulate HIF2alpha levels and localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in normoxia enables translation of viral lytic mRNAs through the HIF2alpha-regulated eIF4E2 translation-initiation complex. This mechanism of translation in infected cells is critical for lytic protein synthesis and contributes to KSHV-induced PDGFRA activation and VEGF secretion. Thus, KSHV regulation of the oxygen-sensing machinery allows virally infected cells to initiate translation via the mTOR-dependent eIF4E1 or the HIF2alpha-dependent, mTOR-independent, eIF4E2.

34750583	The development of a functional vasculature requires the coordinated control of cell fate, lineage differentiation and network growth. Cellular proliferation is spatiotemporally regulated in developing vessels, but how this is orchestrated in different lineages is unknown. Here, using a zebrafish genetic screen for lymphatic-deficient mutants, we uncover a mutant for the RNA helicase Ddx21. Ddx21 cell-autonomously regulates lymphatic vessel development. An established regulator of ribosomal RNA synthesis and ribosome biogenesis, Ddx21 is enriched in sprouting venous endothelial cells in response to Vegfc-Flt4 signalling. Ddx21 function is essential for Vegfc-Flt4-driven endothelial cell proliferation. In the absence of Ddx21, endothelial cells show reduced ribosome biogenesis, p53 and p21 upregulation and cell cycle arrest that blocks lymphangiogenesis. Thus, Ddx21 coordinates the lymphatic endothelial cell response to Vegfc-Flt4 signalling by balancing ribosome biogenesis and p53 function. This mechanism may be targetable in diseases of excessive lymphangiogenesis such as cancer metastasis or lymphatic malformation.

34562453	Juvenile hormone (JH) acid methyltransferase (JHAMT) is a rate-limiting enzyme that converts JH acids or inactive precursors of JHs to active JHs at the final step of JH biosynthesis in insects and thus presents an excellent target for the development of insect growth regulators or insecticides. However, the three-dimensional properties and catalytic mechanism of this enzyme are not known. Herein, we report the crystal structure of the JHAMT apoenzyme, the three-dimensional holoprotein in binary complex with its cofactor S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, and the ternary complex with S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine and its substrate methyl farnesoate. These structures reveal the ultrafine definition of the binding patterns for JHAMT with its substrate/cofactor. Comparative structural analyses led to novel findings concerning the structural specificity of the progressive conformational changes required for binding interactions that are induced in the presence of cofactor and substrate. Importantly, structural and biochemical analyses enabled identification of one strictly conserved catalytic Gln/His pair within JHAMTs required for catalysis and further provide a molecular basis for substrate recognition and the catalytic mechanism of JHAMTs. These findings lay the foundation for the mechanistic understanding of JH biosynthesis by JHAMTs and provide a rational framework for the discovery and development of specific JHAMT inhibitors as insect growth regulators or insecticides.

34905385	Activating mutations in Galphaq/11 proteins are frequent in uveal melanoma, the most common eye cancer arising from the uveal tract. A small proportion of uveal melanomas have a D630Y mutation in phospholipase C beta4 (PLCbeta4), an effector of Galphaq/11. Here, we found that the D630Y mutation in PLCbeta4 results in a high level of constitutive PLCbeta4 activity. Mutations at the corresponding position in other PLC isoforms also resulted in constitutive activity, revealing an unrecognized mechanism underlying PLC activation. In cultured human uveal melanoma cell lines, inhibition of PLC suppressed proliferation in Galphaq/11-dependent cells. Furthermore, we found that PLCbeta4(D630Y) mediated proliferation in cutaneous melanocytes and the growth of melanomas in mice. These results are consistent with PLCbeta4(D630Y) driving oncogenic signaling downstream of Galphaq/11.

34818534	Treatments aiming to augment immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in cancer often focus on T cell immunity, but innate immune cells may have important roles to play. Here, we demonstrate a single-dose combination treatment (termed AIP) using a pan-tumor-targeting antibody surrogate, half-life-extended interleukin-2 (IL-2), and anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), which primes tumors to respond to subsequent ICB and promotes rejection of large established tumors in mice. Natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages activated by AIP treatment underwent transcriptional reprogramming; rapidly killed cancer cells; governed the recruitment of cross-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) and other leukocytes; and induced normalization of the tumor vasculature, facilitating further immune infiltration. Thus, innate cell-activating therapies can initiate critical steps leading to a self-sustaining cycle of T cell priming driven by ICB.

35148816	Stresses such as heat shock trigger the formation of protein aggregates and the induction of a disaggregation system composed of molecular chaperones. Recent work reveals that several cases of apparent heat-induced aggregation, long thought to be the result of toxic misfolding, instead reflect evolved, adaptive biomolecular condensation, with chaperone activity contributing to condensate regulation. Here we show that the yeast disaggregation system directly disperses heat-induced biomolecular condensates of endogenous poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1) orders of magnitude more rapidly than aggregates of the most commonly used misfolded model substrate, firefly luciferase. Beyond its efficiency, heat-induced condensate dispersal differs from heat-induced aggregate dispersal in its molecular requirements and mechanistic behavior. Our work establishes a bona fide endogenous heat-induced substrate for long-studied heat shock proteins, isolates a specific example of chaperone regulation of condensates, and underscores needed expansion of the proteotoxic interpretation of the heat shock response to encompass adaptive, chaperone-mediated regulation.

34525349	Human hematopoiesis is a dynamic process that starts in utero 18-21 days post-conception. Understanding the site- and stage-specific variation in hematopoiesis is important if we are to understand the origin of hematological disorders, many of which occur at specific points in the human lifespan. To unravel how the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment changes during human ontogeny and the underlying gene regulatory mechanisms, we compare 57,489 HSPCs from 5 different tissues spanning 4 developmental stages through the human lifetime. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis identifies significant site- and developmental stage-specific transitions in cellular architecture and gene regulatory networks. Hematopoietic stem cells show progression from cycling to quiescence and increased inflammatory signaling during ontogeny. We demonstrate the utility of this dataset for understanding aberrant hematopoiesis through comparison to two cancers that present at distinct time points in postnatal life-juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, a childhood cancer, and myelofibrosis, which classically presents in older adults.

Despite showing potent efficacy in BRAF-mutated melanoma, MEK inhibitors appeared to be tolerated by colorectal cancer cells due to their intrinsic compensatory signaling. Here, we performed genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening in the presence of MEK inhibitor to identify genes that are synthetically lethal with MEK inhibition in CRC models harboring KRAS mutations. Several genes were identified as potential functional drivers, which were significantly enriched in the GRB7-mediated RTK pathway. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays validated that GRB7 potently rendered CRC cells primary resistance to MEK inhibitors through the RTK pathway. Mass spectrum analysis of GRB7 immunoprecipitates revealed that PLK1 was the predominant interacting kinase of GRB7. Inhibition of PLK1 suppressed downstream signaling of RTK, including FAK, STAT3, AKT, and 4EBP1. The combination of PLK1 and MEK inhibitors synergistically inhibited CRC cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, we identified GRB7-PLK1 as a pivotal axis mediating RTKs, resulting in MEK inhibitor tolerance. PLK1 is therefore a promising target for synergizing MEK inhibitors in the clinical treatment of CRC patients harboring KRAS mutations.

34706224	SLX4/FANCP is a key Fanconi anemia (FA) protein and a DNA repair scaffold for incision around a DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) by its partner XPF nuclease. The tandem UBZ4 ubiquitin-binding domains of SLX4 are critical for the recruitment of SLX4 to damage sites, likely by binding to K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. However, the identity of the ubiquitin E3 ligase that mediates SLX4 recruitment remains unknown. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) screening with a GFP-tagged N-terminal half of SLX4 (termed SLX4-N), we identify the RNF168 E3 ligase as a critical factor for mitomycin C (MMC)-induced SLX4 foci formation. RNF168 and GFP-SLX4-N colocalize in MMC-induced ubiquitin foci. Accumulation of SLX4-N at psoralen-laser ICL tracks or of endogenous SLX4 at Digoxigenin-psoralen/UVA ICL is dependent on RNF168. Finally, we find that RNF168 is epistatic with SLX4 in promoting MMC tolerance. We conclude that RNF168 is a critical component of the signal transduction that recruits SLX4 to ICL damage.	RNF168 E3 ligase participates in ubiquitin signaling and recruitment of SLX4 during DNA crosslink repair.	Cell reports	0.0	0
34965439	Osteopontin (OPN) has been considered a potential biomarker of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, the function of OPN in GVHD is still elusive. Using a mouse model of acute GVHD (aGVHD), we report that OPN generated by CD4(+) T cells is sufficient to exert a beneficial effect in controlling aGVHD through limiting gastrointestinal pathology, a major target organ of aGVHD. CD4(+) T cell-derived OPN works on CD44 expressed in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and abates cell death of IECs. OPN also modulates gut microbiota with enhanced health-associated commensal bacteria Akkermansia. Importantly, we use our in vivo mouse mutant model to specifically express OPN isoforms and demonstrate that secreted OPN (sOPN), not intracellular OPN (iOPN), is solely responsible for the protective role of OPN. This study demonstrates that sOPN generated by CD4(+) T cells is potent enough to limit aGVHD.	Secreted osteopontin from CD4(+) T cells limits acute graft-versus-host disease.	Cell reports	0.0	0
34619149	The ubiquitously expressed transcription factor interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is critical for the induction of antiviral genes, e.g., type-I IFN. In addition to its transcriptional function, IRF3 also activates a nontranscriptional, proapoptotic signaling pathway. While the proapoptotic function of IRF3 protects against viral infections, it is also involved in harmful immune responses that trigger hepatocyte cell death and promote liver disease. Thus, we hypothesized that a small-molecule inhibitor of the proapoptotic activity of IRF3 could alleviate fatty-acid-induced hepatocyte cell death. We conducted a high-throughput screen, which identified auranofin as a small-molecule inhibitor of the proapoptotic activity of IRF3. In addition to the nontranscriptional apoptotic pathway, auranofin also inhibited the transcriptional activity of IRF3. Using biochemical and genetic tools in human and mouse cells, we uncovered a novel mechanism of action for auranofin, in which it induces cellular autophagy to degrade IRF3 protein, thereby suppressing IRF3 functions. Autophagy-deficient cells were unable to degrade IRF3 upon auranofin treatment, suggesting that the autophagic degradation of IRF3 is a novel approach to regulate IRF3 activities. Using a physiologically relevant in vitro model, we demonstrated that auranofin inhibited fatty-acid-induced apoptotic cell death of hepatocytes. In summary, auranofin is a novel inhibitor of IRF3 functions and may represent a potential therapeutic option in diseases where IRF3 is deleterious.

34758321	Kinetochores assemble on chromosomes in mitosis to allow microtubules to attach and bring about accurate chromosome segregation. The kinases Cyclin B-Cdk1 and Aurora B are crucial for the formation of stable kinetochores. However, the activity of these two kinases appears to decline dramatically at centromeres during anaphase onset, precisely when microtubule attachments are required to move chromosomes toward opposite poles of the dividing cell. We find that, although Aurora B leaves centromeres at anaphase, a gradient of Aurora B activity centered on the central spindle is still able to phosphorylate kinetochore substrates such as Dsn1 to modulate kinetochore stability in anaphase and to regulate kinetochore disassembly as cells enter telophase. We provide a model to explain how Aurora B co-operates with Cyclin B-Cdk1 to maintain kinetochore function in anaphase.	The Aurora B gradient sustains kinetochore stability in anaphase.

34551310	Cold-induced thermogenesis in endotherms demands adaptive thermogenesis fueled by mitochondrial respiration and Ucp1-mediated uncoupling in multilocular brown adipocytes (BAs). However, dietary regulation of thermogenesis in BAs isn't fully understood. Here, we describe that the deficiency of Leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat containing-protein (Lrpprc) in BAs reduces mtDNA-encoded ETC gene expression, causes ETC proteome imbalance, and abolishes the mitochondria-fueled thermogenesis. BA-specific Lrpprc knockout mice are cold resistant in a 4 degrees C cold-tolerance test in the presence of food, which is accompanied by the activation of transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and proteome turnover in BAs. ATF4 activation genetically by BA-specific ATF4 overexpression or physiologically by a low-protein diet feeding can improve cold tolerance in wild-type and Ucp1 knockout mice. Furthermore, ATF4 activation in BAs improves systemic metabolism in obesogenic environment regardless of Ucp1's action. Therefore, our study reveals a diet-dependent but Ucp1-independent thermogenic mechanism in BAs that is relevant to systemic thermoregulation and energy homeostasis.	Brown adipocyte ATF4 activation improves thermoregulation and systemic metabolism.	Cell reports	0.0	0
35145221	Gene editing is a powerful tool for genome and cell engineering. Exemplified by CRISPR-Cas, gene editing could cause DNA damage and trigger DNA repair processes that are often error-prone. Such unwanted mutations and safety concerns can be exacerbated when altering long sequences. Here we couple microbial single-strand annealing proteins (SSAPs) with catalytically inactive dCas9 for gene editing. This cleavage-free gene editor, dCas9-SSAP, promotes the knock-in of long sequences in mammalian cells. The dCas9-SSAP editor has low on-target errors and minimal off-target effects, showing higher accuracy than canonical Cas9 methods. It is effective for inserting kilobase-scale sequences, with an efficiency of up to approximately 20% and robust performance across donor designs and cell types, including human stem cells. We show that dCas9-SSAP is less sensitive to inhibition of DNA repair enzymes than Cas9 references. We further performed truncation and aptamer engineering to minimize its size to fit into a single adeno-associated-virus vector for future application. Together, this tool opens opportunities towards safer long-sequence genome engineering.	dCas9-based gene editing for cleavage-free genomic knock-in of long sequences.	Nature cell biology	0.0	0
34537245	"Combating the worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the emergence of new variants demands understanding of the structural basis of the interaction of antibodies with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD). Here, we report five X-ray crystal structures of sybodies (synthetic nanobodies) including those of binary and ternary complexes of Sb16-RBD, Sb45-RBD, Sb14-RBD-Sb68, and Sb45-RBD-Sb68, as well as unliganded Sb16. These structures reveal that Sb14, Sb16, and Sb45 bind the RBD at the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interface and that the Sb16 interaction is accompanied by a large conformational adjustment of complementarity-determining region 2. In contrast, Sb68 interacts at the periphery of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interface. We also determined cryo-EM structures of Sb45 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Superposition of the X-ray structures of sybodies onto the trimeric spike protein cryo-EM map indicates that some sybodies may bind in both ""up"" and ""down"" configurations, but others may not. Differences in sybody recognition of several recently identified RBD variants are explained by these structures."

34469730	The regulation of lipid homeostasis is not well understood. Using forward genetic screening, we demonstrate that the loss of dTBC1D22, an essential gene that encodes a Tre2-Bub2-Cdc16 (TBC) domain-containing protein, results in lipid droplet accumulation in multiple tissues. We observe that dTBC1D22 interacts with Rab40 and exhibits GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity. Overexpression of either the GTP- or GDP-binding-mimic form of Rab40 results in lipid droplet accumulation. We observe that Rab40 mutant flies are defective in lipid mobilization. The lipid depletion induced by overexpression of Brummer, a triglyceride lipase, is dependent on Rab40. Rab40 mutant flies exhibit decreased lipophagy and small size of autolysosomal structures, which may be due to the defective Golgi functions. Finally, we demonstrate that Rab40 physically interacts with Lamp1, and Rab40 is required for the distribution of Lamp1 during starvation. We propose that dTBC1D22 functions as a GAP for Rab40 to regulate lipophagy.

35051351	Leading CRISPR-Cas technologies employ Cas9 and Cas12 enzymes that generate RNA-guided dsDNA breaks. Yet, the most abundant microbial adaptive immune systems, Type I CRISPRs, are under-exploited for eukaryotic applications. Here, we report the adoption of a minimal CRISPR-Cas3 from Neisseria lactamica (Nla) type I-C system to create targeted large deletions in the human genome. RNP delivery of its processive Cas3 nuclease and target recognition complex Cascade can confer approximately 95% editing efficiency. Unexpectedly, NlaCascade assembly in bacteria requires internal translation of a hidden component Cas11 from within the cas8 gene. Furthermore, expressing a separately encoded NlaCas11 is the key to enable plasmid- and mRNA-based editing in human cells. Finally, we demonstrate that supplying cas11 is a universal strategy to systematically implement divergent I-C, I-D, and I-B CRISPR-Cas3 editors with compact sizes, distinct PAM preferences, and guide orthogonality. These findings greatly expand our ability to engineer long-range genome edits.	Cas11 enables genome engineering in human cells with compact CRISPR-Cas3 systems.	Molecular cell	0.0	0
34551304	Both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitter receptors can influence maturation and survival of adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus; nevertheless, how these two neurotransmitter systems affect integration of new neurons into the existing circuitry is still not fully characterized. Here, we demonstrate that glutamate receptors of the kainate receptor (KAR) subfamily are expressed in adult-born dentate granule cells (abDGCs) and that, through their interaction with GABAergic signaling mechanisms, they alter the functional properties of adult-born cells during a critical period of their development. Both the intrinsic properties and synaptic connectivity of young abDGCs were affected. Timed KAR loss in a cohort of young adult-born neurons in mice disrupted their performance in a spatial discrimination task but not in a hippocampal-dependent fear conditioning task. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of KARs in the proper functional development of young abDGCs.

34706236	Infant MLL-AF4-driven acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a devastating disease with dismal prognosis. A lack of understanding of the unique biology of this disease, particularly its prenatal origin, has hindered improvement of survival. We perform multiple RNA sequencing experiments on fetal, neonatal, and adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from human and mouse. This allows definition of a conserved fetal transcriptional signature characterized by a prominent proliferative and oncogenic nature that persists in infant ALL blasts. From this signature, we identify a number of genes in functional validation studies that are critical for survival of MLL-AF4+ ALL cells. Of particular interest are PLK1 because of the readily available inhibitor and ELOVL1, which highlights altered fatty acid metabolism as a feature of infant ALL. We identify which aspects of the disease are residues of its fetal origin and potential disease vulnerabilities.

34637789	Influenza A virus (IAV) infection casts a significant burden on society. It has particularly high morbidity and mortality rates in patients suffering from metabolic disorders. The aim of this study was to relate metabolic changes with IAV susceptibility using well-characterized inbred mouse models. We compared the highly susceptible DBA/2J (D2) mouse strain for which IAV infection is lethal with the C57BL/6J (B6) strain, which exhibits a moderate course of disease and survives IAV infection. Previous studies showed that D2 has higher insulin and glucose levels and is predisposed to develop diet-induced type 2 diabetes. Using high-resolution liquid chromatography-coupled MS, the plasma metabolomes of individual animals were repeatedly measured up to 30 days postinfection. The biggest metabolic difference between these strains in healthy and infected states was in the levels of malonylcarnitine, which was consistently increased 5-fold in D2. Other interstrain and intrastrain differences in healthy and infected animals were observed for acylcarnitines, glucose, branched-chain amino acids, and oxidized fatty acids. By mapping metabolic changes to canonical pathways, we found that mitochondrial beta-oxidation is likely disturbed in D2 animals. In noninfected D2 mice, this leads to increased glycerolipid production and reduced acylcarnitine production, whereas in infected D2 animals, peroxisomal beta-oxidation becomes strongly increased. From these studies, we conclude that metabolic changes caused by a distortion of mitochondrial and peroxisomal metabolism might impact the innate immune response in D2, leading to high viral titers and mortality.	Impaired beta-oxidation increases vulnerability to influenza A infection.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0.0	0
34418435	Proteases serve as important tools in biotechnology and as valuable drugs or drug targets. Efficient protein engineering methods to study and modulate protease properties are thus of great interest for a plethora of applications. We established PROFICS (PRotease Optimization via Fusion-Inhibited Carbamoyltransferase-based Selection), a bacterial selection system, which enables the optimization of proteases for biotechnology, therapeutics or diagnosis in a simple overnight process. During the PROFICS process, proteases are selected for their ability to specifically cut a tag from a reporter enzyme and leave a native N-terminus. Precise and efficient cleavage after the recognition sequence reverses the phenotype of an Escherichia coli knockout strain deficient in an essential enzyme of pyrimidine synthesis. A toolbox was generated to select for proteases with different preferences for P1' residues (the residue immediately following the cleavage site). The functionality of PROFICS is demonstrated with viral proteases and human caspase-2. PROFICS improved caspase-2 activity up to 25-fold after only one round of mutation and selection. Additionally, we found a significantly improved tolerance for all P1' residues caused by a mutation in a substrate interaction site. We showed that this improved activity enables cells containing the new variant to outgrow cells containing all other mutants, facilitating its straightforward selection. Apart from optimizing enzymatic activity and P1' tolerance, PROFICS can be used to reprogram specificities, erase off-target activity, optimize expression via tags/codon usage, or even to screen for potential drug-resistance-conferring mutations in therapeutic targets such as viral proteases in an unbiased manner.

34667276	The bipolar androgen therapy (BAT) to treat prostate cancer (PCa) includes cycles of supraphysiological androgen levels (SAL) under androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). We showed previously that SAL induces cellular senescence in androgen-sensitive PCa cells and in ex vivo-treated patient PCa tumor samples. Here, we analyzed the underlying molecular pathway and reveal that SAL induces cellular senescence in both, castration-sensitive (CSPC) LNCaP and castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) C4-2 cells through the cell cycle inhibitor p15(INK4b) and increased phosphorylation of AKT. Treatment with the AKT inhibitor (AKTi) potently inhibited SAL-induced expression of p15(INK4b) and cellular senescence in both cell lines. Proximity-ligation assays (PLA) combined with high-resolution laser-scanning microscopy indicate that SAL promotes interaction of endogenous androgen receptor (AR) with AKT in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus detectable after three days. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) comparing the SAL-induced transcriptomes of LNCaP with C4-2 cells as well as with AKTi-treated cell transcriptomes revealed landscapes for cell senescence. Interestingly, one of the identified genes is the lncRNASAT1. SAL treatment of native patient tumor samples ex vivo upregulates lncRNASAT1. In PCa tumor tissues, lncRNASAT1 is downregulated compared with nontumor tissues of the same patients. Knockdown indicates that the lncRNASAT1 is crucial for SAL-induced cancer-cell senescence as an upstream factor for pAKT and for p15(INK4b). Further, knockdown of lncRNASAT1 enhances cell proliferation by SAL, suggesting that lncRNASAT1 serves as a tumor suppressor at SAL. Interestingly, immunoprecipitation of AR detected lncRNASAT1 as an AR-interacting partner that regulates AR target-gene expression. Similarly, RNA-ChIP experiments revealed the interaction of AR with lncRNASAT1 on chromatin. Thus, we identified a novel AR-lncRNASAT1-AKT-p15(INK4b) signaling axis to mediate SAL-induced cellular senescence.

34645978	Platinum-based chemotherapy, including cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin, is prescribed to 10-20% of all cancer patients. Unfortunately, platinum resistance develops in a significant number of patients and is a determinant of clinical outcome. Extensive research has been conducted to understand and overcome platinum resistance, and mechanisms of resistance can be categorized into several broad biological processes, including (1) regulation of drug entry, exit, accumulation, sequestration, and detoxification, (2) enhanced repair and tolerance of platinum-induced DNA damage, (3) alterations in cell survival pathways, (4) alterations in pleiotropic processes and pathways, and (5) changes in the tumor microenvironment. As a resource to the cancer research community, we provide a comprehensive overview accompanied by a manually curated database of the >900 genes/proteins that have been associated with platinum resistance over the last 30 years of literature. The database is annotated with possible pathways through which the curated genes are related to platinum resistance, types of evidence, and hyperlinks to literature sources.

34975152	Genomic loss of RB1 is a common alteration in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and is associated with poor patient outcomes. RB1 loss is also a critical event that promotes the neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of prostate cancer (PCa) induced by the androgen receptor (AR) signaling inhibition (ARSi). The loss of Rb protein disrupts the Rb-E2F repressor complex and thus hyperactivates E2F transcription activators. While the impact of Rb inactivation on PCa progression and linage plasticity has been previously studied, there is a pressing need to fully understand underlying mechanisms and identify vulnerabilities that can be therapeutically targeted in Rb-deficient CRPC. Using an integrated cistromic and transcriptomic analysis, we have characterized Rb activities in multiple CRPC models by identifying Rb-directly regulated genes and revealed that Rb has distinct binding sites and targets in CRPC with different genomic backgrounds. Significantly, we show that E2F1 chromatin binding and transcription activity in Rb-deficient CRPC are highly dependent on LSD1/KDM1A, and that Rb inactivation sensitizes CRPC tumor to the LSD1 inhibitor treatment. These results provide new molecular insights into Rb activity in PCa progression and suggest that targeting LSD1 activity with small molecule inhibitors may be a potential treatment strategy to treat Rb-deficient CRPC.

34736895	Rif1 regulates DNA replication timing and double-strand break repair, and its depletion induces transcriptional bursting of two-cell (2C) zygote-specific genes in mouse ES cells. However, how Rif1 regulates zygotic transcription is unclear. We show here that Rif1 depletion promotes the formation of a unique Zscan4 enhancer structure harboring both histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) and moderate levels of silencing chromatin mark H3K9me3. Curiously, another enhancer mark H3K4me1 is missing, whereas DNA methylation is still maintained in the structure, which spreads across gene bodies and neighboring regions within the Zscan4 gene cluster. We also found by function analyses of Rif1 domains in ES cells that ectopic expression of Rif1 lacking N-terminal domain results in upregulation of 2C transcripts. This appears to be caused by dominant negative inhibition of endogenous Rif1 protein localization at the nuclear periphery through formation of hetero-oligomers between the N-terminally truncated and endogenous forms. Strikingly, in murine 2C embryos, most of Rif1-derived polypeptides are expressed as truncated forms in soluble nuclear or cytosolic fraction and are likely nonfunctional. Toward the morula stage, the full-length form of Rif1 gradually increased. Our results suggest that the absence of the functional full-length Rif1 due to its instability or alternative splicing and potential inactivation of Rif1 through dominant inhibition by N-terminally truncated Rif1 polypeptides may be involved in 2C-specific transcription program.	Loss of full-length DNA replication regulator Rif1 in two-cell embryos is associated with zygotic transcriptional activation.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0.0	0
34986327	We have analyzed BNT162b2 vaccine-induced immune responses in naive subjects and individuals recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), both soon after (14 days) and later after (almost 8 months) vaccination. Plasma spike (S)-specific immunoglobulins peak after one vaccine shot in individuals recovered from COVID-19, while a second dose is needed in naive subjects, although the latter group shows reduced levels all along the analyzed period. Despite how the neutralization capacity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mirrors this behavior early after vaccination, both groups show comparable neutralizing antibodies and S-specific B cell levels late post-vaccination. When studying cellular responses, naive individuals exhibit higher SARS-CoV-2-specific cytokine production, CD4(+) T cell activation, and proliferation than do individuals recovered from COVID-19, with patent inverse correlations between humoral and cellular variables early post-vaccination. However, almost 8 months post-vaccination, SARS-CoV-2-specific responses are comparable between both groups. Our data indicate that a previous history of COVID-19 differentially determines the functional T and B cell-mediated responses to BNT162b2 vaccination over time.

34450033	SARS-CoV-2 infection causes respiratory insufficiency and neurological manifestations, including loss of smell and psychiatric disorders, and can be fatal. Most vaccines are based on the spike antigen alone, and although they have shown efficacy at preventing severe disease and death, they do not always confer sterilizing immunity. Here, we interrogate whether SARS-CoV-2 vaccines could be improved by incorporating nucleocapsid as an antigen. We show that, after 72 h of challenge, a spike-based vaccine confers acute protection in the lung, but not in the brain. However, combining a spike-based vaccine with a nucleocapsid-based vaccine confers acute protection in both the lung and brain. These findings suggest that nucleocapsid-specific immunity can improve the distal control of SARS-CoV-2, warranting the inclusion of nucleocapsid in next-generation COVID-19 vaccines.

34838820	High-fidelity DNA polymerases select the correct nucleotide over the structurally similar incorrect nucleotides with extremely high specificity while maintaining fast rates of incorporation. Previous analysis revealed the conformational dynamics and complete kinetic pathway governing correct nucleotide incorporation using a high-fidelity DNA polymerase variant containing a fluorescent unnatural amino acid. Here we extend this analysis to investigate the kinetics of nucleotide misincorporation and mismatch extension. We report the specificity constants for all possible misincorporations and characterize the conformational dynamics of the enzyme during misincorporation and mismatch extension. We present free energy profiles based on the kinetic measurements and discuss the effect of different steps on specificity. During mismatch incorporation and subsequent extension with the correct nucleotide, the rates of the conformational change and chemistry are both greatly reduced. The nucleotide dissociation rate, however, increases to exceed the rate of chemistry. To investigate the structural basis for discrimination against mismatched nucleotides, we performed all atom molecular dynamics simulations on complexes with either the correct or mismatched nucleotide bound at the polymerase active site. The simulations suggest that the closed form of the enzyme with a mismatch bound is greatly destabilized due to weaker interactions with active site residues, nonideal base pairing, and a large increase in the distance from the 3'-OH group of the primer strand to the alpha-phosphate of the incoming nucleotide, explaining the reduced rates of misincorporation. The observed kinetic and structural mechanisms governing nucleotide misincorporation reveal the general principles likely applicable to other high-fidelity DNA polymerases.

35120588	The superkiller (SKI) complex is the cytoplasmic co-factor and regulator of the RNA-degrading exosome. In human cells, the SKI complex functions mainly in co-translational surveillance-decay pathways, and its malfunction is linked to a severe congenital disorder, the trichohepatoenteric syndrome. To obtain insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating the human SKI (hSKI) complex, we structurally characterized several of its functional states in the context of 80S ribosomes and substrate RNA. In a prehydrolytic ATP form, the hSKI complex exhibits a closed conformation with an inherent gating system that effectively traps the 80S-bound RNA into the hSKI2 helicase subunit. When active, hSKI switches to an open conformation in which the gating is released and the RNA 3' end exits the helicase. The emerging picture is that the gatekeeping mechanism and architectural remodeling of hSKI underpin a regulated RNA channeling system that is mechanistically conserved among the cytoplasmic and nuclear helicase-exosome complexes.	The human SKI complex regulates channeling of ribosome-bound RNA to the exosome via an intrinsic gatekeeping mechanism.	Molecular cell	0.0	0
34896150	Patients who recover from nosocomial pneumonia oftentimes exhibit long-lasting cognitive impairment comparable with what is observed in Alzheimer's disease patients. We previously hypothesized that the lung endothelium contributes to infection-related neurocognitive dysfunction, because bacteria-exposed endothelial cells release a form(s) of cytotoxic tau that is sufficient to impair long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. However, the full-length lung and endothelial tau isoform(s) have yet to be resolved and it remains unclear whether the infection-induced endothelial cytotoxic tau triggers neuronal tau aggregation. Here, we demonstrate that lung endothelial cells express a big tau isoform and three additional tau isoforms that are similar to neuronal tau, each containing four microtubule-binding repeat domains, and that tau is expressed in lung capillaries in vivo. To test whether infection elicits endothelial tau capable of causing transmissible tau aggregation, the cells were infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The infection-induced tau released from endothelium into the medium-induced neuronal tau aggregation in reporter cells, including reporter cells that express either the four microtubule-binding repeat domains or the full-length tau. Infection-induced release of pathological tau variant(s) from endothelium, and the ability of the endothelial-derived tau to cause neuronal tau aggregation, was abolished in tau knockout cells. After bacterial lung infection, brain homogenates from WT mice, but not from tau knockout mice, initiated tau aggregation. Thus, we conclude that bacterial pneumonia initiates the release of lung endothelial-derived cytotoxic tau, which is capable of propagating a neuronal tauopathy.	Cytotoxic tau released from lung microvascular endothelial cells upon infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa promotes neuronal tauopathy.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0.0	0
35021076	Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a form of stable cell-cycle arrest arising in response to oncogenic stimulation. OIS must be bypassed for transformation, but the mechanisms of OIS establishment and bypass remain poorly understood, especially at the post-transcriptional level. Here, we show that the RNA-binding protein UNR/CSDE1 enables OIS in primary mouse keratinocytes. Depletion of CSDE1 leads to senescence bypass, cell immortalization, and tumor formation, indicating that CSDE1 behaves as a tumor suppressor. Unbiased high-throughput analyses uncovered that CSDE1 promotes OIS by two independent molecular mechanisms: enhancement of the stability of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factor mRNAs and repression of Ybx1 mRNA translation. Importantly, depletion of YBX1 from immortal keratinocytes rescues senescence and uncouples proliferation arrest from the SASP, revealing multilayered mechanisms exerted by CSDE1 to coordinate senescence. Our data highlight the relevance of post-transcriptional control in the regulation of senescence.	Coordinated post-transcriptional control of oncogene-induced senescence by UNR/CSDE1.

34686340	Converting checkpoint inhibitor (CPI)-resistant individuals to being responsive requires identifying suppressive mechanisms. We identify TREM2(+) tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) as being correlated with exhausted CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in mouse syngeneic tumor models and human solid tumors of multiple histological types. Fc domain-enhanced anti-TREM2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy promotes anti-tumor immunity by elimination and modulation of TAM populations, which leads to enhanced CD8(+) TIL infiltration and effector function. TREM2(+) TAMs are most enriched in individuals with ovarian cancer, where TREM2 expression corresponds to disease grade accompanied by worse recurrence-free survival. In an aggressive orthotopic ovarian cancer model, anti-TREM2 mAb therapy drives potent anti-tumor immunity. These results highlight TREM2 as a highly attractive target for immunotherapy modulation in individuals who are refractory to CPI therapy and likely have a TAM-rich tumor microenvironment.

34965420	Evidence that the brain combines different value learning strategies to minimize prediction error is accumulating. However, the tradeoff between bias and variance error, which imposes different constraints on each learning strategy's performance, poses a challenge for value learning. While this tradeoff specifies the requirements for optimal learning, little has been known about how the brain deals with this issue. Here, we hypothesize that the brain adaptively resolves the bias-variance tradeoff during reinforcement learning. Our theory suggests that the solution necessitates baseline correction for prediction error, which offsets the adverse effects of irreducible error on value learning. We show behavioral evidence of adaptive control using a Markov decision task with context changes. The prediction error baseline seemingly signals context changes to improve adaptability. Critically, we identify multiplexed representations of prediction error baseline within the ventrolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, key brain regions known to guide model-based and model-free reinforcement learning.

34403195	Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most prevalent cancers in men. Cancer stem cells are thought to be associated with PCa relapse. Here, we show that BAZ2A is required for PCa cells with a cancer stem-like state. BAZ2A genomic occupancy in PCa cells coincides with H3K14ac-enriched chromatin regions. This association is mediated by BAZ2A-bromodomain (BAZ2A-BRD) that specifically binds H3K14ac. BAZ2A associates with inactive enhancers marked by H3K14ac and repressing transcription of genes frequently silenced in aggressive and poorly differentiated PCa. BAZ2A-mediated repression is also linked to EP300 that acetylates H3K14ac. BAZ2A-BRD mutations or treatment with inhibitors abrogating BAZ2A-BRD/H3K14ac interaction impair PCa stem cells. Furthermore, pharmacological inactivation of BAZ2A-BRD impairs Pten-loss oncogenic transformation of prostate organoids. Our findings indicate a role of BAZ2A-BRD in PCa stem cell features and suggest potential epigenetic-reader therapeutic strategies to target BAZ2A in aggressive PCa.

35114100	The mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is an essential metabolic hub that coordinates cellular metabolism with the availability of nutrients, including amino acids. Sestrin2 has been identified as a cytosolic leucine sensor that transmits leucine status signals to mTORC1. In this study, we identify an E3 ubiquitin ligase RING finger protein 167 (RNF167) and a deubiquitinase STAMBPL1 that function in concert to control the polyubiquitination level of Sestrin2 in response to leucine availability. Ubiquitination of Sestrin2 promotes its interaction with GATOR2 and inhibits mTORC1 signaling. Bioinformatic analysis reveals decreased RNF167 expression and increased STAMBPL1 expression in gastric and colorectal tumors. Knockout of STAMBPL1 or correction of the heterozygous STAMBPL1 mutation in a human colon cancer cell line suppresses xenograft tumor growth. Lastly, a cell-permeable peptide that blocks the STAMBPL1-Sestrin2 interaction inhibits mTORC1 and provides a potential option for cancer therapy.

34856122	Argonaute proteins have been traditionally characterized as a highly evolutionary conserved family engaged in post-transcriptional gene silencing pathways. The Argonaute family is mainly grouped into the AGO and PIWI clades. The canonical role of Argonaute proteins relies on their ability to bind small-RNAs that recognize complementary sequences on target mRNAs to induce either mRNA degradation or translational repression. However, there is an increasing amount of evidence supporting that Argonaute proteins also exert multiple nuclear functions that subsequently regulate gene expression. In this line, genome-wide studies showed that members from the AGO clade regulate transcription, 3D chromatin organization, and splicing of active loci located within euchromatin. Here, we discuss recent work based on high-throughput technologies that have significantly contributed to shed light on the multivariate nuclear functions of AGO proteins in different model organisms. We also analyze data supporting that AGO proteins are able to execute these nuclear functions independently from small RNA pathways. Finally, we integrate these mechanistic insights with recent reports highlighting the clinical importance of AGO in breast and prostate cancer development.

34706247	Highly specific expression patterns can be caused by the overlapping activities of activator and repressor sequences in enhancers. However, few studies illuminate how these sequences evolve in the origin of new enhancers. Here, we show that expression of the bond gene in the semicircular wall epithelium (swe) of the Drosophila melanogaster male ejaculatory bulb (EB) is controlled by an enhancer consisting of an activator region that requires Abdominal-B driving expression in the entire EB and a repressor region that restricts this expression to the EB swe. Although this expression pattern is independently gained in the distantly related Scaptodrosophila lebanonensis and does not require Abdominal-B, we show that functionally similar repressor sequences are present in Scaptodrosophila and also in species that do not express bond in the EB. We suggest that during enhancer evolution, repressor sequences can precede the evolution of activator sequences and may lead to similar but independently evolved expression patterns.	Repression precedes independent evolutionary gains of a highly specific gene expression pattern.	Cell reports	0.0	0
34874746	The nuclear translocation and activity of the cotranscriptional activators YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ) in endothelial cells (ECs) are crucial during developmental angiogenesis. Here, we studied the role of YAP/TAZ signaling in ECs in tumor angiogenesis and found that the expression of YAP/TAZ and downstream target genes in ECs correlated with tumor vascularization in human colorectal carcinomas and skin melanoma. Treatment with the YAP/TAZ inhibitor verteporfin reduced vessel density and tumor progression in a mouse colorectal cancer (CRC) model. Conditional deletion of YAP/TAZ in ECs reduced tumor angiogenesis and growth in a mouse B16-F10 melanoma model. Using cultured ECs and mice with EC-specific ablation, we showed that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was required for the activation of YAP/TAZ in tumor-associated ECs. Moreover, we showed that STAT3-mediated signaling promoted YAP/TAZ activity and that the nuclear shuttling machinery for STAT3 was also required for YAP/TAZ nuclear translocation. Together, our data highlight the role of YAP/TAZ as critical players in ECs during tumor angiogenesis and provide insight into the signaling pathways leading to their activation.

34973335	2, 4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) and 2, 4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) are well known as skin sensitizers that can cause dermatitis. DNFB has shown to more potently sensitize skin; however, how DNFB and DNCB cause skin inflammation at a molecular level and why this difference in their sensitization ability is observed remain unknown. In this study, we aimed to identify the molecular targets and mechanisms on which DNFB and DNCB act. We used a fluorescent calcium imaging plate reader in an initial screening assay before patch-clamp recordings for validation. Molecular docking in combination with site-directed mutagenesis was then carried out to investigate DNFB and DNCB binding sites in the TRPA1 ion channel that may be selectively activated by these tow sensitizers. We found that DNFB and DNCB selectively activated TRPA1 channel with EC50 values of 2.3 +/- 0.7 muM and 42.4 +/- 20.9 muM, respectively. Single-channel recordings revealed that DNFB and DNCB increase the probability of channel opening and act on three residues (C621, E625, and Y658) critical for TRPA1 activation. Our findings may not only help explain the molecular mechanism underlying the dermatitis and pruritus caused by chemicals such as DNFB and DNCB, but also provide a molecular tool 7.5-fold more potent than the current TRPA1 activator allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) used for investigating TRPA1 channel pharmacology and pathology.

34758302	Mutations in mitochondrial genes impairing energy production cause mitochondrial diseases (MDs), and clinical studies have shown that MD patients are prone to bacterial infections. However, the relationship between mitochondrial (dys)function and infection remains largely unexplored, especially in epithelial cells, the first barrier to many pathogens. Here, we generate an epithelial cell model for one of the most common mitochondrial diseases, Leigh syndrome, by deleting surfeit locus protein 1 (SURF1), an assembly factor for respiratory chain complex IV. We use this genetic model and a complementary, nutrient-based approach to modulate mitochondrial respiration rates and show that impaired mitochondrial respiration favors entry of the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, a well-established bacterial infection model. Reversely, enhanced mitochondrial energy metabolism decreases infection efficiency. We further demonstrate that endocytic recycling is reduced in mitochondrial respiration-dependent cells, dampening L. monocytogenes infection by slowing the recycling of its host cell receptor c-Met, highlighting a previously undescribed role of mitochondrial respiration during infection.

34758315	Early blastomeres of mouse preimplantation embryos exhibit bi-potential cell fate, capable of generating both embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages in blastocysts. Here we identify three major two-cell-stage (2C)-specific endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) as the molecular hallmark of this bi-potential plasticity. Using the long terminal repeats (LTRs) of all three 2C-specific ERVs, we identify Kruppel-like factor 5 (Klf5) as their major upstream regulator. Klf5 is essential for bi-potential cell fate; a single Klf5-overexpressing embryonic stem cell (ESC) generates terminally differentiated embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages in chimeric embryos, and Klf5 directly induces inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) specification genes. Intriguingly, Klf5 and Klf4 act redundantly during ICM specification, whereas Klf5 deficiency alone impairs TE specification. Klf5 is regulated by multiple 2C-specific transcription factors, particularly Dux, and the Dux/Klf5 axis is evolutionarily conserved. The 2C-specific transcription program converges on Klf5 to establish bi-potential cell fate, enabling a cell state with dual activation of ICM and TE genes.

34644585	Rabbit embryos develop as bilaminar discs at gastrulation as in humans and most other mammals, whereas rodents develop as egg cylinders. Primordial germ cells (PGCs) appear to originate during gastrulation according to many systematic studies on mammalian embryos. Here, we show that rabbit PGC (rbPGC) specification occurs at the posterior epiblast at the onset of gastrulation. Using newly derived rabbit pluripotent stem cells, we show robust and rapid induction of rbPGC-like cells in vitro with WNT and BMP morphogens, which reveals SOX17 as the critical regulator of rbPGC fate as in several non-rodent mammals. We posit that development as a bilaminar disc is a crucial determinant of the PGC regulators, regardless of the highly diverse development of extraembryonic tissues, including the amnion. We propose that investigations on rabbits with short gestation, large litters, and where gastrulation precedes implantation can contribute significantly to advances in early mammalian development.

34845375	Metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) in bone induces bone-forming lesions that enhance PCa progression. How tumor-induced bone formation enhances PCa progression is not known. We have previously shown that PCa-induced bone originates from endothelial cells (ECs) that have undergone endothelial-to-osteoblast (EC-to-OSB) transition by tumor-secreted bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4). Here, we show that EC-to-OSB transition leads to changes in the tumor microenvironment that increases the metastatic potential of PCa cells. We found that conditioned medium (CM) from EC-OSB hybrid cells increases the migration, invasion, and survival of PC3-mm2 and C4-2B4 PCa cells. Quantitative mass spectrometry (Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation) identified Tenascin C (TNC) as one of the major proteins secreted from EC-OSB hybrid cells. TNC expression in tumor-induced OSBs was confirmed by immunohistochemistry of MDA PCa-118b xenograft and human bone metastasis specimens. Mechanistically, BMP4 increases TNC expression in EC-OSB cells through the Smad1-Notch/Hey1 pathway. How TNC promotes PCa metastasis was next interrogated by in vitro and in vivo studies. In vitro studies showed that a TNC-neutralizing antibody inhibits EC-OSB-CM-mediated PCa cell migration and survival. TNC knockdown decreased, while the addition of recombinant TNC or TNC overexpression increased migration and anchorage-independent growth of PC3 or C4-2b cells. When injected orthotopically, PC3-mm2-shTNC clones decreased metastasis to bone, while C4-2b-TNC-overexpressing cells increased metastasis to lymph nodes. TNC enhances PCa cell migration through alpha5beta1 integrin-mediated YAP/TAZ inhibition. These studies elucidate that tumor-induced stromal reprogramming generates TNC that enhances PCa metastasis and suggest that TNC may be a target for PCa therapy.

34936863	Bacterial toxin-antitoxin modules contribute to the stress adaptation, persistence, and dormancy of bacteria for survival under environmental stresses and are involved in bacterial pathogenesis. In Salmonella Typhimurium, the Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase toxin TacT reportedly acetylates the alpha-amino groups of the aminoacyl moieties of several aminoacyl-tRNAs, inhibits protein synthesis, and promotes persister formation during the infection of macrophages. Here, we show that TacT exclusively acetylates Gly-tRNA(Gly)in vivo and in vitro. The crystal structure of the TacT:acetyl-Gly-tRNA(Gly) complex and the biochemical analysis reveal that TacT specifically recognizes the discriminator U73 and G71 in tRNA(Gly), a combination that is only found in tRNA(Gly) isoacceptors, and discriminates tRNA(Gly) from other tRNA species. Thus, TacT is a Gly-tRNA(Gly)-specific acetyltransferase toxin. The molecular basis of the specific aminoacyl-tRNA acetylation by TacT provides advanced information for the design of drugs targeting Salmonella.

34634302	The human general transcription factor TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and 13 TBP-associated factors (TAFs). In eukaryotic cells, TFIID is thought to nucleate RNA polymerase II (Pol II) preinitiation complex formation on all protein coding gene promoters and thus, be crucial for Pol II transcription. TFIID is composed of three lobes, named A, B, and C. A 5TAF core complex can be assembled in vitro constituting a building block for the further assembly of either lobe A or B in TFIID. Structural studies showed that TAF8 forms a histone fold pair with TAF10 in lobe B and participates in connecting lobe B to lobe C. To better understand the role of TAF8 in TFIID, we have investigated the requirement of the different regions of TAF8 for the in vitro assembly of lobe B and C and the importance of certain TAF8 regions for mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) viability. We have identified a region of TAF8 distinct from the histone fold domain important for assembling with the 5TAF core complex in lobe B. We also delineated four more regions of TAF8 each individually required for interacting with TAF2 in lobe C. Moreover, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing indicated that the 5TAF core-interacting TAF8 domain and the proline-rich domain of TAF8 that interacts with TAF2 are both required for mouse embryonic stem cell survival. Thus, our study defines distinct TAF8 regions involved in connecting TFIID lobe B to lobe C that appear crucial for TFIID function and consequent ESC survival.

35165417	During animal embryogenesis, homeostasis and disease, tissues push and pull on their surroundings to move forward. Although the force-generating machinery is known, it is unknown how tissues exert physical stresses on their substrate to generate motion in vivo. Here, we identify the force transmission machinery, the substrate and the stresses that a tissue, the zebrafish posterior lateral line primordium, generates during its migration. We find that the primordium couples actin flow through integrins to the basement membrane for forward movement. Talin- and integrin-mediated coupling is required for efficient migration, and its loss is partially compensated for by increased actin flow. Using Embryogram, an approach to measure stresses in vivo, we show that the rear of the primordium exerts higher stresses than the front, which suggests that this tissue pushes itself forward with its back. This unexpected strategy probably also underlies the motion of other tissues in animals.	Rear traction forces drive adherent tissue migration in vivo.	Nature cell biology	0.0	0
34986355	Translocation renal cell carcinoma (tRCC) is a poorly characterized subtype of kidney cancer driven by MiT/TFE gene fusions. Here, we define the landmarks of tRCC through an integrative analysis of 152 patients with tRCC identified across genomic, clinical trial, and retrospective cohorts. Most tRCCs harbor few somatic alterations apart from MiT/TFE fusions and homozygous deletions at chromosome 9p21.3 (19.2% of cases). Transcriptionally, tRCCs display a heightened NRF2-driven antioxidant response that is associated with resistance to targeted therapies. Consistently, we find that outcomes for patients with tRCC treated with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors (VEGFR-TKIs) are worse than those treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Using multiparametric immunofluorescence, we find that the tumors are infiltrated with CD8(+) T cells, though the T cells harbor an exhaustion immunophenotype distinct from that of clear cell RCC. Our findings comprehensively define the clinical and molecular features of tRCC and may inspire new therapeutic hypotheses.

34787675	In eukaryotes, chromatin binding to the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) contributes to spatial organization of the genome and epigenetic programs important for gene expression. In mitosis, chromatin-nuclear envelope (NE) interactions are lost and then formed again as sister chromosomes segregate to postmitotic nuclei. Investigating these processes in S. cerevisiae, we identified temporally and spatially controlled phosphorylation-dependent SUMOylation events that positively regulate postmetaphase chromatin association with the NE. Our work establishes a phosphorylation-mediated targeting mechanism of the SUMO ligase Siz2 to the INM during mitosis, where Siz2 binds to and SUMOylates the VAP protein Scs2. The recruitment of Siz2 through Scs2 is further responsible for a wave of SUMOylation along the INM that supports the assembly and anchorage of subtelomeric chromatin at the INM and localization of an active gene (INO1) to NPCs during the later stages of mitosis and into G1-phase.

34433082	Research conducted on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogenesis and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) generally focuses on the systemic host response, especially that generated by severely ill patients, with few studies investigating the impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 at the site of infection. We show that the nasal microbiome of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (CoV(+), n = 68) at the time of diagnosis is unique when compared to CoV(-) healthcare workers (n = 45) and CoV(-) outpatients (n = 21). This shift is marked by an increased abundance of bacterial pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is also positively associated with viral RNA load. Additionally, we observe a robust host transcriptional response in the nasal epithelia of CoV(+) patients, indicative of an antiviral innate immune response and neuronal damage. These data suggest that the inflammatory response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with an increased abundance of bacterial pathogens in the nasal cavity that could contribute to increased incidence of secondary bacterial infections.

34525361	Scant understanding of the glioblastoma microenvironment and molecular bases hampers development of efficient treatment strategies. Analyses of gene signatures of human gliomas demonstrate that the SETD2 mutation is correlated with poor prognosis of IDH1/2 wild-type (IDH-WT) adult glioblastoma patients. To better understand the crosstalk between SETD2 mutant (SETD2-mut) glioblastoma cells and the tumor microenvironment, we leverage single-cell transcriptomics to comprehensively map cellular populations in glioblastoma. In this study, we identify a specific subtype of high-grade glioma-associated microglia (HGG-AM). Further analysis shows that transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 derived from SETD2-mut/IDH-WT tumor cells activates HGG-AM, exhibiting pro-inflammation and proliferation signatures. Particularly, HGG-AM secretes interleukin (IL)-1beta via the apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-mediated NLRP1 inflammasome, thereby promoting tumor progression. HGG-AM present extensive proliferation and infiltration to supplement the activated microglia pool. Notably, TGF-beta1/TbetaRI depletion dramatically reduces HGG-AM density and suppresses tumor growth. Altogether, our studies identify a specific microglia subpopulation and establish the cellular basis of interactions between HGG-AM and glioblastoma cells.

34496237	Owing to technical advances in single-cell biology, the appreciation of cellular heterogeneity has increased, which has aided our understanding of organ function, homeostasis, and disease progression. The oviduct (also known as the fallopian tube) is the distalmost portion of the female reproductive tract. It is essential for reproduction and the proposed origin of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). In mammals, the oviduct is morphologically segmented along the ovary-uterus axis into four evolutionally conserved regions. It is unclear, however, if there is a diversification of epithelial cell characteristics between these regions. In this study, we identify transcriptionally distinct populations of secretory and multiciliated cells restricted to the distal and proximal regions of the oviduct. We demonstrate that distal and proximal populations are distinct lineages specified early in Mullerian duct development and are maintained separately. These results aid our understanding of epithelial development, homeostasis, and initiation of disease from the oviduct.	Oviduct epithelial cells constitute two developmentally distinct lineages that are spatially separated along the distal-proximal axis.	Cell reports	0.0	0
35021082	Deficiency of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein seipin results in generalized lipodystrophy by incompletely understood mechanisms. Here, we report mitochondrial abnormalities in seipin-deficient patient cells. A subset of seipin is enriched at ER-mitochondria contact sites (MAMs) in human and mouse cells and localizes in the vicinity of calcium regulators SERCA2, IP3R, and VDAC. Seipin association with MAM calcium regulators is stimulated by fasting-like stimuli, while seipin association with lipid droplets is promoted by lipid loading. Acute seipin removal does not alter ER calcium stores but leads to defective mitochondrial calcium import accompanied by a widespread reduction in Krebs cycle metabolites and ATP levels. In mice, inducible seipin deletion leads to mitochondrial dysfunctions preceding the development of metabolic complications. Together, these data suggest that seipin controls mitochondrial energy metabolism by regulating mitochondrial calcium influx at MAMs. In seipin-deficient adipose tissue, reduced ATP production compromises adipocyte properties, contributing to lipodystrophy pathogenesis.

34754080	Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women worldwide, and the exploration of aberrantly expressed genes might clarify tumorigenesis and help uncover new therapeutic strategies for BC. Although RGMA was recently recognized as a tumor suppressor gene, its detailed biological function and regulation in BC remain unclear. Herein, we found that RGMA was downregulated in BC tissues compared with non-tumorous breast tissues, particularly in metastatic BC samples, and that patients with low RGMA expression manifested a poorer prognosis. Furthermore, DNMT1 and DNMT3A were found to be recruited to the RGMA promoter and induced aberrant hypermethylation, resulting in downregulation of RGMA expression in BC. In contrast, RGMA overexpression suppressed BC cell proliferation and colony-formation capabilities and increased BC cell apoptosis. Furthermore, RGMA knockdown accelerated BC cell proliferation and suppressed cellular apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Reversal of RGMA promoter methylation with 5-Aza-CdR restored RGMA expression and blocked tumor growth. Overall, DNMT1- and DNMT3A-mediated RGMA promoter hypermethylation led to downregulation of RGMA expression, and low RGMA expression contributed to BC growth via activation of the FAK/Src/PI3K/AKT-signaling pathway. Our data thus suggested that RGMA might be a promising therapeutic target in BC.	Aberrant promoter hypermethylation inhibits RGMA expression and contributes to tumor progression in breast cancer.

35016036	Biological systems are composed of a vast web of multiscale molecular interactors and interactions. High-throughput technologies, both bulk and single cell, now allow for investigation of the properties and quantities of these interactors. Computational algorithms and machine learning methods then provide the tools to derive meaningful insights from the resulting data sets. One such approach is graphical network modeling, which provides a computational framework to explicitly model the molecular interactions within and between the cells comprising biological systems. These graphical networks aim to describe a putative chain of cause and effect between interacting molecules. This feature allows for determination of key molecules in a biological process, accelerated generation of mechanistic hypotheses, and simulation of experimental outcomes.

34759347	N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), an internal modification in mRNA, plays a critical role in regulating gene expression. Dysregulation of m(6)A modifiers promotes oncogenesis through enzymatic functions that disrupt the balance between the deposition and removal of m(6)A modification on critical transcripts. However, the roles of mRNA m(6)A in multiple myeloma (MM) are poorly understood. The present study showed that RNA demethylase ALKBH5 was overexpressed in MM and associated with a poor prognosis in MM patients. Knocking down ALKBH5 induced apoptosis and inhibited the growth of MM cells in vitro. Xenograft models and gene set enrichment analysis with patient transcriptome datasets also supported the oncogenic role of ALKBH5 in MM. Mechanistic studies showed that ALKBH5 exerted tumorigenic effects in myeloma in an m(6)A-dependent manner, and TNF receptor-associated factor 1 (TRAF1) was a critical target of ALKBH5. Specifically, ALKBH5 regulated TRAF1 expression via decreasing m(6)A abundance in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of TRAF1 transcripts and enhancing TRAF1 mRNA stability. As a result, ALKBH5 promoted MM cell growth and survival through TRAF1-mediated activation of NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways. Collectively, our data demonstrated that ALKBH5 played a critical role in MM tumorigenesis and suggested that ALKBH5 could be a novel therapeutic target in MM.

34433027	Assigning behavioral roles to genetically defined neurons within the lateral hypothalamus (LH) is an ongoing challenge. We demonstrate that a subpopulation of LH GABAergic neurons expressing leptin receptors (LH(LEPR)) specifically drives appetitive behaviors in mice. Ablation of LH GABAergic neurons (LH(VGAT)) decreases weight gain and food intake, whereas LH(LEPR) ablation does not. Appetitive learning in a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm is delayed in LH(VGAT)-ablated mice but prevented entirely in LH(LEPR)-ablated mice. Both LH(VGAT) and LH(LEPR) neurons bidirectionally modulate reward-related behaviors, but only LH(VGAT) neurons affect feeding. In the Pavlovian paradigm, only LH(LEPR) activity discriminates between conditioned cues. Optogenetic activation or inhibition of either population in this task disrupts discrimination. However, manipulations of LH(LEPR)-->VTA projections evoke divergent effects on responding. Unlike food-oriented learning, chemogenetic inhibition of LH(LEPR) neurons does not alter cocaine-conditioned place preference but attenuates cocaine sensitization. Thus, LH(LEPR) neurons may specifically regulate appetitive behaviors toward non-drug reinforcers.	Lateral hypothalamic LEPR neurons drive appetitive but not consummatory behaviors.

34958801	Contactins (CNTNs) are neural cell adhesion molecules that encode axon-target specificity during the patterning of the vertebrate visual and olfactory systems. Because CNTNs are tethered to the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, they lack an intracellular region to communicate across the membrane. Instead, they form coreceptor complexes with distinct transmembrane proteins to transmit signals inside the cell. In particular, a complex of CNTN4 and amyloid precursor protein (APP) is known to guide the assembly of specific circuits in the visual system. Here, using in situ hybridization in zebrafish embryos, we show that CNTN4, CNTN5, and the APP homologs, amyloid beta precursor like protein 1 and amyloid beta precursor like protein 2, are expressed in olfactory pits, suggesting that these receptors may also function together in the organization of olfactory tissues. Furthermore, we use biochemical and structural approaches to characterize interactions between members of these two receptor families. In particular, APP and amyloid beta precursor like protein 1 interact with CNTN3-5, whereas amyloid beta precursor like protein 2 only binds to CNTN4 and CNTN5. Finally, structural analyses of five CNTN-amyloid pairs indicate that these proteins interact through a conserved interface involving the second fibronectin type III repeat of CNTNs and the copper-binding domain of amyloid proteins. Overall, this work sets the stage for analyzing CNTN-amyloid-mediated connectivity in vertebrate sensory circuits.

34965411	During somatic reprogramming, cellular energy metabolism fundamentally switches from predominantly mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation toward glycolysis. This metabolic reprogramming, also called the Warburg effect, is critical for the induction of pluripotency, but its molecular mechanisms remain poorly defined. Notably, SIRT2 is consistently downregulated during the reprogramming process and regulates glycolytic switch. Here, we report that downregulation of SIRT2 increases acetylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase-1 (MEK1) at Lys175, resulting in activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and subsequent activation of the pro-fission factor dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1). In parallel, downregulation of SIRT2 hyperacetylates the serine/threonine protein kinase AKT1 at Lys20 in a non-canonical way, activating DRP1 and metabolic reprogramming. Together, our study identified two axes, SIRT2-MEK1-ERK-DRP1 and SIRT2-AKT1-DRP1, that critically link mitochondrial dynamics and oxidative phosphorylation to the somatic reprogramming process. These upstream signals, together with SIRT2's role in glycolytic switching, may underlie the Warburg effect observed in human somatic cell reprogramming.

34731611	The dense variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat of African trypanosomes represents the primary host-pathogen interface. Antigenic variation prevents clearing of the pathogen by employing a large repertoire of antigenically distinct VSG genes, thus neutralizing the host's antibody response. To explore the epitope space of VSGs, we generate anti-VSG nanobodies and combine high-resolution structural analysis of VSG-nanobody complexes with binding assays on living cells, revealing that these camelid antibodies bind deeply inside the coat. One nanobody causes rapid loss of cellular motility, possibly due to blockage of VSG mobility on the coat, whose rapid endocytosis and exocytosis are mechanistically linked to Trypanosoma brucei propulsion and whose density is required for survival. Electron microscopy studies demonstrate that this loss of motility is accompanied by rapid formation and shedding of nanovesicles and nanotubes, suggesting that increased protein crowding on the dense membrane can be a driving force for membrane fission in living cells.

35007533	Amyloid proteins are widespread in nature both as pathological species involved in several diseases and as functional entities that can provide protection and storage for the organism. Lipids have been found in amyloid deposits from various amyloid diseases and have been shown to strongly affect the formation and structure of both pathological and functional amyloid proteins. Here, we investigate how fibrillation of the functional amyloid FapC from Pseudomonas is affected by two lysolipids, the zwitterionic lipid 1-myristoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and the anionic lipid 1-myristoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (LPG). Small-angle X-ray scattering, circular dichroism, dynamic light scattering, and thioflavin T fluorescence measurements were performed simultaneously on the same sample to ensure reproducibility and allow a multimethod integrated analysis. We found that LPG strongly induces fibrillation around its critical micelle concentration (cmc) by promoting formation of large structures, which mature via accumulation of intermediate fibril structures with a large cross section. At concentrations above its cmc, LPG strongly inhibits fibrillation by locking FapC in a core-shell complex. In contrast, lipid 1-myristoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine induces fibrillation at concentrations above its cmc, not via strong interactions with FapC but by being incorporated during fibrillation and likely stabilizing the fibrillation nucleus to reduce the lag phase. Finally, we show that LPG is not incorporated into the fibril during assembly but rather can coat the final fibril. We conclude that lipids affect both the mechanism and outcome of fibrillation of functional amyloid, highlighting a role for lipid concentration and composition in the onset and mechanism of fibrillation in vivo.

34619147	"Unique among metazoan repressive histone methyltransferases, G9a and GLP, which chiefly target histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9), require dimerization for productive H3K9 mono (me1)- and dimethylation (me2) in vivo. Intriguingly, even though each enzyme can independently methylate H3K9, the predominant active form in vivo is a heterodimer of G9a and GLP. How dimerization influences the central H3K9 methyl binding (""reading"") and deposition (""writing"") activity of G9a and GLP and why heterodimerization is essential in vivo remains opaque. Here, we examine the H3K9me ""reading"" and ""writing"" activities of defined, recombinantly produced homo- and heterodimers of G9a and GLP. We find that both reading and writing are significantly enhanced in the heterodimer. Compared with the homodimers, the heterodimer has higher recognition of H3K9me2, and a striking approximately 10-fold increased turnover rate for nucleosomal substrates under multiple turnover conditions, which is not evident on histone tail peptide substrates. Cross-linking Mass Spectrometry suggests that differences between the homodimers and the unique activity of the heterodimer may be encoded in altered ground state conformations, as each dimer displays different domain contacts. Our results indicate that heterodimerization may be required to relieve autoinhibition of H3K9me reading and chromatin methylation evident in G9a and GLP homodimers. Relieving this inhibition may be particularly important in early differentiation when large tracts of H3K9me2 are typically deposited by G9a-GLP, which may require a more active form of the enzyme."

34686350	Cell death provides host defense and maintains homeostasis. Zalpha-containing molecules are essential for these processes. Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) activates inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, whereas adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) serves as an RNA editor to maintain homeostasis. Here, we identify and characterize ADAR1's interaction with ZBP1, defining its role in cell death regulation and tumorigenesis. Combining interferons (IFNs) and nuclear export inhibitors (NEIs) activates ZBP1-dependent PANoptosis. ADAR1 suppresses this PANoptosis by interacting with the Zalpha2 domain of ZBP1 to limit ZBP1 and RIPK3 interactions. Adar1(fl/fl)LysM(cre) mice are resistant to development of colorectal cancer and melanoma, but deletion of the ZBP1 Zalpha2 domain restores tumorigenesis in these mice. In addition, treating wild-type mice with IFN-gamma and the NEI KPT-330 regresses melanoma in a ZBP1-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that ADAR1 suppresses ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis, promoting tumorigenesis. Defining the functions of ADAR1 and ZBP1 in cell death is fundamental to informing therapeutic strategies for cancer and other diseases.

34661337	Oxygen plays an important role in diverse biological processes. However, since quantitation of the partial pressure of cellular oxygen in vivo is challenging, the extent of oxygen perturbation in situ and its cellular response remains underexplored. Using two-photon phosphorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, we determine the physiological range of oxygen tension in osteoclasts of live mice. We find that oxygen tension ranges from 17.4 to 36.4 mmHg, under hypoxic and normoxic conditions, respectively. Physiological normoxia thus corresponds to 5% and hypoxia to 2% oxygen in osteoclasts. Hypoxia in this range severely limits osteoclastogenesis, independent of energy metabolism and hypoxia-inducible factor activity. We observe that hypoxia decreases ten-eleven translocation (TET) activity. Tet2/3 cooperatively induces Prdm1 expression via oxygen-dependent DNA demethylation, which in turn activates NFATc1 required for osteoclastogenesis. Taken together, our results reveal that TET enzymes, acting as functional oxygen sensors, regulate osteoclastogenesis within the physiological range of oxygen tension, thus opening new avenues for research on in vivo response to oxygen perturbation.

34592158	Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) results from a complex interplay of damage to the sensory cells of the inner ear, dysfunction of its lateral wall, axonal retraction of type 1C spiral ganglion neurons, and activation of the immune response. We use RiboTag and single-cell RNA sequencing to survey the cell-type-specific molecular landscape of the mouse inner ear before and after noise trauma. We identify induction of the transcription factors STAT3 and IRF7 and immune-related genes across all cell-types. Yet, cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes dominate the response. The ATF3/ATF4 stress-response pathway is robustly induced in the type 1A noise-resilient neurons, potassium transport genes are downregulated in the lateral wall, mRNA metabolism genes are downregulated in outer hair cells, and deafness-associated genes are downregulated in most cell types.

34936876	GABAergic synaptic inhibition controls neuronal firing, excitability, and synaptic plasticity to regulate neuronal circuits. Following an acute excitotoxic insult, inhibitory synapses are eliminated, reducing synaptic inhibition, elevating circuit excitability, and contributing to the pathophysiology of brain injuries. However, mechanisms that drive inhibitory synapse disassembly and elimination are undefined. We find that inhibitory synapses are disassembled in a sequential manner following excitotoxicity: GABAARs undergo rapid nanoscale rearrangement and are dispersed from the synapse along with presynaptic active zone components, followed by the gradual removal of the gephyrin scaffold, prior to complete elimination of the presynaptic terminal. GABAAR nanoscale reorganization and synaptic declustering depends on calcineurin signaling, whereas disassembly of gephyrin relies on calpain activation, and blockade of both enzymes preserves inhibitory synapses after excitotoxic insult. Thus, inhibitory synapse disassembly occurs rapidly, with nanoscale precision, in a stepwise manner and most likely represents a critical step in the progression of hyperexcitability following excitotoxicity.

34779552	Oxaliplatin (L-OHP) is a standard treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC), but chemoresistance is a considerable challenge. L-OHP shows dose-dependent toxicity, and potential approaches that sensitize cancer cells to L-OHP could reduce the dosage. With the development of translatomics, it was found that some lncRNAs encode short peptides. Here, we use ribosome footprint profiling combined with lncRNA-Seq to screen 12 lncRNAs with coding potential, of which lnc-AP encodes the short peptide pep-AP, for their role in L-OHP resistance. Co-IP and LC-MS/MS data show that the TALDO1 protein interacts with pep-AP and that pep-AP suppresses the expression of TALDO1. The pep-AP/TALDO1 pathway attenuates the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), reducing NADPH/NADP(+) and glutathione (GSH) levels and causing ROS accumulation and apoptosis, which sensitizes CRC cells to L-OHP in vitro and in vivo. pep-AP thus might become a potential anticancer peptide for future treatments of L-OHP-resistant CRC.	lncRNA-encoded pep-AP attenuates the pentose phosphate pathway and sensitizes colorectal cancer cells to Oxaliplatin.

34854870	"In eukaryotic nuclei, most genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNAP2), whose regulation is a key to understanding the genome and cell function. RNAP2 has a long heptapeptide repeat (Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7), and Ser2 is phosphorylated on an elongation form. To detect RNAP2 Ser2 phosphorylation (RNAP2 Ser2ph) in living cells, we developed a genetically encoded modification-specific intracellular antibody (mintbody) probe. The RNAP2 Ser2ph-mintbody exhibited numerous foci, possibly representing transcription ""factories,"" and foci were diminished during mitosis and in a Ser2 kinase inhibitor. An in vitro binding assay using phosphopeptides confirmed the mintbody's specificity. RNAP2 Ser2ph-mintbody foci were colocalized with proteins associated with elongating RNAP2 compared with factors involved in the initiation. These results support the view that mintbody localization represents the sites of RNAP2 Ser2ph in living cells. RNAP2 Ser2ph-mintbody foci showed constrained diffusional motion like chromatin, but they were more mobile than DNA replication domains and p300-enriched foci, suggesting that the elongating RNAP2 complexes are separated from more confined chromatin domains."

34965414	Neuronal CaMKII holoenzymes (alpha and beta isoforms) enable molecular signal computation underlying learning and memory but also mediate excitotoxic neuronal death. Here, we provide a comparative analysis of these signaling devices, using single-particle electron microscopy (EM) in combination with biochemical and live-cell imaging studies. In the basal state, both isoforms assemble mainly as 12-mers (but also 14-mers and even 16-mers for the beta isoform). CaMKIIalpha and beta isoforms adopt an ensemble of extended activatable states (with average radius of 12.6 versus 16.8 nm, respectively), characterized by multiple transient intra- and inter-holoenzyme interactions associated with distinct functional properties. The extended state of CaMKIIbeta allows direct resolution of intra-holoenzyme kinase domain dimers. These dimers could enable cooperative activation by calmodulin, which is observed for both isoforms. High-order CaMKII clustering mediated by inter-holoenzyme kinase domain dimerization is reduced for the beta isoform for both basal and excitotoxicity-induced clusters, both in vitro and in neurons.

34686345	SARM1 is an inducible TIR-domain NAD(+) hydrolase that mediates pathological axon degeneration. SARM1 is activated by an increased ratio of NMN to NAD(+), which competes for binding to an allosteric activating site. When NMN binds, the TIR domain is released from autoinhibition, activating its NAD(+) hydrolase activity. The discovery of this allosteric activating site led us to hypothesize that other NAD(+)-related metabolites might activate SARM1. Here, we show the nicotinamide analog 3-acetylpyridine (3-AP), first identified as a neurotoxin in the 1940s, is converted to 3-APMN, which activates SARM1 and induces SARM1-dependent NAD(+) depletion, axon degeneration, and neuronal death. In mice, systemic treatment with 3-AP causes rapid SARM1-dependent death, while local application to the peripheral nerve induces SARM1-dependent axon degeneration. We identify 2-aminopyridine as another SARM1-dependent neurotoxin. These findings identify SARM1 as a candidate mediator of environmental neurotoxicity and suggest that SARM1 agonists could be developed into selective agents for neurolytic therapy.

35167339	Cellular signaling responses show substantial cell-to-cell heterogeneity, which is often ascribed to the inherent randomness of biochemical reactions, termed molecular noise, wherein high noise implies low signaling fidelity. Alternatively, heterogeneity could arise from differences in molecular content between cells, termed molecular phenotypic variability, which does not necessarily imply imprecise signaling. The contribution of these two processes to signaling heterogeneity is unclear. Here, we fused fibroblasts to produce binuclear syncytia to distinguish noise from phenotypic variability in the analysis of cytokine signaling. We reasoned that the responses of the two nuclei within one syncytium could approximate the signaling outcomes of two cells with the same molecular content, thereby disclosing noise contribution, whereas comparison of different syncytia should reveal contribution of phenotypic variability. We found that ~90% of the variance in the primary response (which was the abundance of phosphorylated, nuclear STAT) to stimulation with the cytokines interferon-gamma and oncostatin M resulted from differences in the molecular content of individual cells. Thus, our data reveal that cytokine signaling in the system used here operates in a reproducible, high-fidelity manner.	Phenotypic variability, not noise, accounts for most of the cell-to-cell heterogeneity in IFN-gamma and oncostatin M signaling responses.	Science signaling	0.0	0
34648735	As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads, variants with enhanced virulence and transmissibility have emerged. Although in vitro systems allow rapid characterization, they do not fully recapitulate the dynamic interaction of virions and neutralizing antibodies in the airway. Here, we demonstrate that the N501Y variant permits respiratory infection in unmodified mice. We utilize N501Y to survey in vivo pseudovirus infection dynamics and susceptibility to reinfection with the L452R (Los Angeles), K417N + E484K (South Africa), and L452R + K417N + E484Q (India) variants. Human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)+ or vaccinated antibody isotypes, titers, variant receptor binding domain (RBD) binding, and neutralization potential are studied, revealing numerous significant correlations. Immune escape of the K417N + E484K variant is observed because infection can be appreciated in the nasopharynx, but not lungs, of mice transferred with low-antibody-tier plasma. Conversely, near-complete protection is observed in animals receiving high-antibody-tier plasma, a phenomenon that can only be appreciated in vivo.

34418433	The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling controls cell metabolism, promotes cell survival, and contributes to tumorigenesis, yet its upstream regulation remains poorly defined. Although considerable evidence supports the prevailing view that amino acids activate mTOR complex 1 but not mTORC2, several studies reported paradoxical activation of mTORC2 signaling by amino acids. We noted that after amino acid starvation of cells in culture, addition of an amino acid solution increased mTORC2 signaling. Interestingly, we found the pH of the amino acid solution to be alkaline, approximately pH 10. These observations led us to discover and demonstrate here that alkaline intracellular pH (pHi) represents a previously unknown activator of mTORC2. Using a fluorescent pH-sensitive dye (cSNARF1-AM) coupled with live-cell imaging, we demonstrate that culturing cells in media at an alkaline pH induces a rapid rise in the pHi, which increases mTORC2 catalytic activity and downstream signaling to the pro-growth and pro-survival kinase Akt. Alkaline pHi also activates AMPK, a canonical sensor of energetic stress. Functionally, alkaline pHi activates AMPK-mTOR signaling, which attenuates apoptosis caused by growth factor withdrawal. Collectively, these findings reveal that alkaline pHi increases mTORC2- and AMPK-mediated signaling to promote cell survival during conditions of growth factor limitation, analogous to the demonstrated ability of energetic stress to activate AMPK-mTORC2 and promote cell survival. As an elevated pHi represents an underappreciated hallmark of cancer cells, we propose that the alkaline pHi stress sensing by AMPK-mTORC2 may contribute to tumorigenesis by enabling cancer cells at the core of a growing tumor to evade apoptosis and survive.

34717958	Within the superfamily of small GTPases, Ras appears to be the master regulator of such processes as cell cycle progression, cell division, and apoptosis. Several oncogenic Ras mutations at amino acid positions 12, 13, and 61 have been identified that lose their ability to hydrolyze GTP, giving rise to constitutive signaling and eventually development of cancer. While disruption of the Ras/effector interface is an attractive strategy for drug design to prevent this constitutive activity, inhibition of this interaction using small molecules is impractical due to the absence of a cavity to which such molecules could bind. However, proteins and especially natural Ras effectors that bind to the Ras/effector interface with high affinity could disrupt Ras/effector interactions and abolish procancer pathways initiated by Ras oncogene. Using a combination of computational design and in vitro evolution, we engineered high-affinity Ras-binding proteins starting from a natural Ras effector, RASSF5 (NORE1A), which is encoded by a tumor suppressor gene. Unlike previously reported Ras oncogene inhibitors, the proteins we designed not only inhibit Ras-regulated procancer pathways, but also stimulate anticancer pathways initiated by RASSF5. We show that upon introduction into A549 lung carcinoma cells, the engineered RASSF5 mutants decreased cell viability and mobility to a significantly greater extent than WT RASSF5. In addition, these mutant proteins induce cellular senescence by increasing acetylation and decreasing phosphorylation of p53. In conclusion, engineered RASSF5 variants provide an attractive therapeutic strategy able to oppose cancer development by means of inhibiting of procancer pathways and stimulating anticancer processes.

34610314	Regulated insertion and removal of postsynaptic AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediates hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory. In Alzheimer's disease beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomers may impair learning and memory by altering AMPAR trafficking and LTP/LTD balance. Importantly, Ca(2+)-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs) assembled from GluA1 subunits are excluded from hippocampal synapses basally but can be recruited rapidly during LTP and LTD to modify synaptic strength and signaling. By employing mouse knockin mutations that disrupt anchoring of the kinase PKA or phosphatase Calcineurin (CaN) to the postsynaptic scaffold protein AKAP150, we find that local AKAP-PKA signaling is required for CP-AMPAR recruitment, which can facilitate LTP but also, paradoxically, prime synapses for Abeta impairment of LTP mediated by local AKAP-CaN LTD signaling that promotes subsequent CP-AMPAR removal. These findings highlight the importance of PKA/CaN signaling balance and CP-AMPARs in normal plasticity and aberrant plasticity linked to disease.	beta-Amyloid disruption of LTP/LTD balance is mediated by AKAP150-anchored PKA and Calcineurin regulation of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors.

34731612	Human neuroimaging studies have shown that, during cognitive processing, the brain undergoes dynamic transitions between multiple, frequency-tuned states of activity. Although different states may emerge from distinct sources of neural activity, it remains unclear whether single-area neuronal spiking can also drive multiple dynamic states. In mice, we ask whether frequency modulation of the entorhinal cortex activity causes dynamic states to emerge and whether these states respond to distinct stimulation frequencies. Using hidden Markov modeling, we perform unsupervised detection of transient states in mouse brain-wide fMRI fluctuations induced via optogenetic frequency modulation of excitatory neurons. We unveil the existence of multiple, frequency-dependent dynamic states, invisible through standard static fMRI analyses. These states are linked to different anatomical circuits and disrupted in a frequency-dependent fashion in a transgenic model of cognitive disease directly related to entorhinal cortex dysfunction. These findings provide cross-scale insight into basic neuronal mechanisms that may underpin flexibility in brain-wide dynamics.

34091599	Dysfunction of adipocytes and adipose tissue is a primary defect in obesity and obesity-associated metabolic diseases. Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) has been implicated in adipogenesis. However, the role of IRF3 in obesity and obesity-associated disorders remains unclear. Here, we show that IRF3 expression in human adipose tissues is positively associated with insulin sensitivity and negatively associated with type 2 diabetes. In mouse pre-adipocytes, deficiency of IRF3 results in increased expression of PPARgamma and PPARgamma-mediated adipogenic genes, leading to increased adipogenesis and altered adipocyte functionality. The IRF3 knockout (KO) mice develop obesity, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and eventually type 2 diabetes with aging, which is associated with the development of white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation. Increased macrophage accumulation with M1 phenotype which is due to the loss of IFNbeta-mediated IL-10 expression is observed in WAT of the KO mice compared to that in wild-type mice. Bone-marrow reconstitution experiments demonstrate that the nonhematopoietic cells are the primary contributors to the development of obesity and both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells contribute to the development of obesity-related complications in IRF3 KO mice. This study demonstrates that IRF3 regulates the biology of multiple cell types including adipocytes and macrophages to prevent the development of obesity and obesity-related complications and hence, could be a potential target for therapeutic interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity-associated metabolic disorders.

34793838	Signals from retinal photoreceptors are processed in two parallel channels-the ON channel responds to light increments, while the OFF channel responds to light decrements. The ON pathway is mediated by ON type bipolar cells (BCs), which receive glutamatergic synaptic input from photoreceptors via a G-protein-coupled receptor signaling cascade. The metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR6 is located at the dendritic tips of all ON-BCs and is required for synaptic transmission. Thus, it is critically important for delivery of information from photoreceptors into the ON pathway. In addition to detecting glutamate, mGluR6 participates in interactions with other postsynaptic proteins, as well as trans-synaptic interactions with presynaptic ELFN proteins. Mechanisms of mGluR6 synaptic targeting and functional interaction with other synaptic proteins are unknown. Here, we show that multiple regions in the mGluR6 ligand-binding domain are necessary for both synaptic localization in BCs and ELFN1 binding in vitro. However, these regions were not required for plasma membrane localization in heterologous cells, indicating that secretory trafficking and synaptic localization are controlled by different mechanisms. In contrast, the mGluR6 C-terminus was dispensable for synaptic localization. In mGluR6 null mice, localization of the postsynaptic channel protein TRPM1 was compromised. Introducing WT mGluR6 rescued TRPM1 localization, while a C-terminal deletion mutant had significantly reduced rescue ability. We propose a model in which trans-synaptic ELFN1 binding is necessary for mGluR6 postsynaptic localization, whereas the C-terminus has a role in mediating TRPM1 trafficking. These findings reveal different sequence determinants of the multifunctional roles of mGluR6 in ON-BCs.	The mGluR6 ligand-binding domain, but not the C-terminal domain, is required for synaptic localization in retinal ON-bipolar cells.	The Journal of biological chemistry	4.0	1
34726954	Damaged skeletal muscle can regenerate because of the coordinated action of immune cells with muscle stem cells, called satellite cells. Proinflammatory macrophages infiltrate skeletal muscle soon after injury to sustain the proliferation of satellite cells. These macrophages later acquire the anti-inflammatory phenotype and promote the differentiation and fusion of satellite cells. Here, we showed that MCUb, the dominant-negative subunit of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex, promotes muscle regeneration by controlling macrophage responses. Macrophages lacking MCUb lost the ability to efficiently acquire the anti-inflammatory profile, and mice with MCUb-deficient macrophages showed delayed regeneration through exhaustion of the satellite cell pool. MCUb ablation altered macrophage metabolism by promoting glycolysis and the accumulation of TCA cycle intermediates, which was accompanied by the stabilization of HIF-1alpha, the master transcriptional regulator of the macrophage proinflammatory program. Together, these data demonstrate that MCUb abundance is tightly controlled in macrophages to enable satellite cell functional differentiation and recovery of tissue homeostasis after damage.

34551281	ADP-ribose (ADPr) readers are essential components of ADP-ribosylation signaling, which regulates genome maintenance and immunity. The identification and discrimination between monoADPr (MAR) and polyADPr (PAR) readers is difficult because of a lack of suitable affinity-enrichment reagents. We synthesized well-defined ADPr probes and used these for affinity purifications combined with relative and absolute quantitative mass spectrometry to generate proteome-wide MAR and PAR interactomes, including determination of apparent binding affinities. Among the main findings, MAR and PAR readers regulate various common and distinct processes, such as the DNA-damage response, cellular metabolism, RNA trafficking, and transcription. We monitored the dynamics of PAR interactions upon induction of oxidative DNA damage and uncovered the mechanistic connections between ubiquitin signaling and ADP-ribosylation. Taken together, chemical biology enables exploration of MAR and PAR readers using interaction proteomics.

34762910	SRY-box 2 (Sox2) is a transcription factor with critical roles in maintaining embryonic stem (ES) cell and adult stem cell functions and in tumorigenesis. However, how Sox2 exerts its transcriptional function remains unclear. Here, we used an in vitro protein-protein interaction assay to discover transcriptional regulators for ES cell core transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) and identified members of the steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs) as Sox2-specific interacting proteins. The SRC family coactivators have broad roles in transcriptional regulation, but it is unknown whether they also serve as Sox2 coactivators. We demonstrated that these proteins facilitate Sox2 transcriptional activity and act synergistically with p300. Furthermore, we uncovered an acetylation-enhanced interaction between Sox2 and SRC-2/3, but not SRC-1, demonstrating it is Sox2 acetylation that promotes the interaction. We identified putative Sox2 acetylation sites required for acetylation-enhanced interaction between Sox2 and SRC-3 and demonstrated that acetylation on these sites contributes to Sox2 transcriptional activity and recruitment of SRC-3. We showed that activation domains 1 and 2 of SRC-3 both display a preferential binding to acetylated Sox2. Finally, functional analyses in mouse ES cells demonstrated that knockdown of SRC-2/3 but not SRC-1 in mouse ES cells significantly downregulates the transcriptional activities of various Sox2 target genes and impairs ES cell stemness. Taken together, we identify specific SRC family proteins as novel Sox2 coactivators and uncover the role of Sox2 acetylation in promoting coactivator recruitment and Sox2 transcriptional function.

34743207	We previously found the SLC3A2-NRG1 (S-N) fusion gene in a lung adenocarcinoma specimen without known driver mutations and validated this in 59 invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (IMA) samples. Interestingly, KRAS mutation coexisted (62.5%) in 10 out of 16 NRG1 fusions. In this study, we examined the role of mutant KRAS in regulating the S-N fusion protein in KRAS mutant (H358) and wild-type (Calu-3) cells. KRAS mutation-mediated increase in MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 activity enhanced disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)17 activity, which increased the shedding of NRG1 from the S-N fusion protein. The cleavage of NRG1 also increased the phosphorylation of ERBB2-ERBB3 heterocomplex receptors and their downstream signalling pathways, including PI3K/Akt/mTOR, even under activated KRAS mutation signalling. The concurrence of S-N fusion and KRAS mutation synergistically increased cell proliferation, colony formation, tumour growth, and the cells' resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors more than KRAS mutation alone. Targeted inhibition of MEK1/2, and ADAM17 significantly induced apoptosis singly and when combined with each mutation singly or with chemotherapy in both the concurrent KRAS mutant and S-N fusion xenograft and lung orthotopic models. Taken together, this is the first study to report that KRAS mutation increased NRG1 cleavage from the S-N fusion protein through ADAM17, thereby enhancing the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and ERBB/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. Moreover, the coexistence of KRAS mutant and S-N fusion in lung tumours renders them vulnerable to MEK1/2 and/or ADAM17 inhibitors, at least in part, due to their dependency on the strong positive loop between KRAS mutation and S-N fusion.

35034964	Inflammatory bowel diseases, like ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are frequently accompanied by colorectal cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying colitis-associated cancers are not fully understood. Src Kinase Associated Phosphoprotein 2 (SKAP2), a substrate of Src family kinases, is highly expressed in macrophages. Here, we examined the effects of SKAP2 on inflammatory responses in a mouse model of tumorigenesis with colitis induced by azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium. SKAP2 knockout increased the severity of colitis and tumorigenesis, as well as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced acute inflammation. SKAP2 attenuated inflammatory signaling in macrophages induced by uptake of cancer cell-derived exosomes. SKAP2(-/-) mice were characterized by the activation of NF-kappaB signaling and the upregulation and release of cytokines including TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL-9/-10/-13, and sICAM1; SKAP2 overexpression attenuated NF-kappaB activation. Mechanistically, SKAP2 formed a complex with the SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase via association with the Sirpalpha transmembrane receptor. SKAP2 also physically associated with the TIR domain of MyD88, TIRAP, and TRAM, adaptors of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). SKAP2-mediated recruitment of the Sirpalpha/SHP-1 complex to TLR4 attenuated inflammatory responses, whereas direct interaction of SKAP2 with SHP-2 decreased SHP-2 activation. SHP-2 is required for efficient NF-kappaB activation and suppresses the TRAM/TRIF-INFbeta pathway; therefore, SKAP2-mediated SHP-2 inhibition affected two signaling axes from TLR4. The present findings indicate that SKAP2 prevents excess inflammation by inhibiting the TLR4-NF-kappaB pathway, and it activates the TLR4-IFNbeta pathway through SHP-1 and SHP-2, thereby suppressing inflammation-mediated tumorigenesis.

34731606	RBFOX2, which has a well-established role in alternative splicing, is linked to heart diseases. However, it is unclear whether RBFOX2 has other roles in RNA processing that can influence gene expression in muscle cells, contributing to heart disease. Here, we employ both 3'-end and nanopore cDNA sequencing to reveal a previously unrecognized role for RBFOX2 in maintaining alternative polyadenylation (APA) signatures in myoblasts. RBFOX2-mediated APA modulates mRNA levels and/or isoform expression of a collection of genes, including contractile and mitochondrial genes. Depletion of RBFOX2 adversely affects mitochondrial health in myoblasts, correlating with disrupted APA of mitochondrial gene Slc25a4. Mechanistically, RBFOX2 regulation of Slc25a4 APA is mediated through consensus RBFOX2 binding motifs near the distal polyadenylation site, enforcing the use of the proximal polyadenylation site. In sum, our results unveil a role for RBFOX2 in fine-tuning expression of mitochondrial and contractile genes via APA in myoblasts relevant to heart diseases.

34492268	Elevated intracellular levels of dNTPs have been shown to be a biochemical marker of cancer cells. Recently, a series of mutations in the multifunctional dNTP triphosphohydrolase (dNTPase), sterile alpha motif and histidine-aspartate domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), have been reported in various cancers. Here, we investigated the structure and functions of SAMHD1 R366C/H mutants, found in colon cancer and leukemia. Unlike many other cancer-specific mutations, the SAMHD1 R366 mutations do not alter cellular protein levels of the enzyme. However, R366C/H mutant proteins exhibit a loss of dNTPase activity, and their X-ray structures demonstrate the absence of dGTP substrate in their active site, likely because of a loss of interaction with the gamma-phosphate of the substrate. The R366C/H mutants failed to reduce intracellular dNTP levels and restrict HIV-1 replication, functions of SAMHD1 that are dependent on the ability of the enzyme to hydrolyze dNTPs. However, these mutants retain dNTPase-independent functions, including mediating dsDNA break repair, interacting with CtIP and cyclin A2, and suppressing innate immune responses. Finally, SAMHD1 degradation in human primary-activated/dividing CD4+ T cells further elevates cellular dNTP levels. This study suggests that the loss of SAMHD1 dNTPase activity induced by R366 mutations can mechanistically contribute to the elevated dNTP levels commonly found in cancer cells.

34929166	The unrelated protein families of the microbial formate-nitrite transporters (FNTs) and aquaporins (AQP) likely adapted the same protein fold through convergent evolution. FNTs facilitate weak acid anion/H(+) cotransport, whereas AQP water channels strictly exclude charged substrates including protons. The FNT channel-like transduction pathway bears two lipophilic constriction sites that sandwich a highly conserved histidine residue. Because of lacking experiments, the function of these constrictions is unclear, and the protonation status of the central histidine during substrate transport remains a matter of debate. Here, we introduced constriction-widening mutations into the prototypical FNT from Escherichia coli, FocA, and assayed formate/H(+) transport properties, water/solute permeability, and proton conductance. We found that enlargement of these constrictions concomitantly decreased formate/formic acid transport. In contrast to wildtype FocA, the mutants were unable to make use of a transmembrane proton gradient as a driving force. A construct in which both constrictions were eliminated exhibited water permeability, similar to AQPs, although accompanied by a proton conductance. Our data indicate that the lipophilic constrictions mainly act as barriers to isolate the central histidine from the aqueous bulk preventing protonation via proton wires. These results are supportive of an FNT transport model in which the central histidine is uncharged, and weak acid substrate anion protonation occurs in the vestibule regions of the transporter before passing the constrictions.	Mutational widening of constrictions in a formate-nitrite/H(+) transporter enables aquaporin-like water permeability and proton conductance.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0.0	0
34599966	The underlying mechanism of neointima formation remains unclear. Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 (USP10) is a deubiquitinase that plays a major role in cancer development and progression. However, the function of USP10 in arterial restenosis is unknown. Herein, USP10 expression was detected in mouse arteries and increased after carotid ligation. The inhibition of USP10 exhibited thinner neointima in the model of mouse carotid ligation. In vitro data showed that USP10 deficiency reduced proliferation and migration of rat thoracic aorta smooth muscle cells (A7r5) and human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). Mechanically, USP10 can bind to Skp2 and stabilize its protein level by removing polyubiquitin on Skp2 in the cytoplasm. The overexpression of Skp2 abrogated cell cycle arrest induced by USP10 inhibition. Overall, the current study demonstrated that USP10 is involved in vascular remodeling by directly promoting VSMC proliferation and migration via stabilization of Skp2 protein expression.

34788596	Positive-strand RNA viruses replicate in close association with rearranged intracellular membranes. For hepatitis C virus (HCV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), these rearrangements comprise endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived double membrane vesicles (DMVs) serving as RNA replication sites. Cellular factors involved in DMV biogenesis are poorly defined. Here, we show that despite structural similarity of viral DMVs with autophagosomes, conventional macroautophagy is dispensable for HCV and SARS-CoV-2 replication. However, both viruses exploit factors involved in autophagosome formation, most notably class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). As revealed with a biosensor, PI3K is activated in cells infected with either virus to produce phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) while kinase complex inhibition or depletion profoundly reduces replication and viral DMV formation. The PI3P-binding protein DFCP1, recruited to omegasomes in early steps of autophagosome formation, participates in replication and DMV formation of both viruses. These results indicate that phylogenetically unrelated HCV and SARS-CoV-2 exploit similar components of the autophagy machinery to create their replication organelles.

34878519	The neuronal axon is packed with cytoskeletal filaments, membranes, and organelles, many of which move between the cell body and axon tip. Here, we used cryo-electron tomography to survey the internal components of mammalian sensory axons. We determined the polarity of the axonal microtubules (MTs) by combining subtomogram classification and visual inspection, finding MT plus and minus ends are structurally similar. Subtomogram averaging of globular densities in the MT lumen suggests they have a defined structure, which is surprising given they likely contain the disordered protein MAP6. We found the endoplasmic reticulum in axons is tethered to MTs through multiple short linkers. We surveyed membrane-bound cargos and describe unexpected internal features such as granules and broken membranes. In addition, we detected proteinaceous compartments, including numerous virus-like capsid particles. Our observations outline novel features of axonal cargos and MTs, providing a platform for identification of their constituents.

34634306	Cardiac myosin is the molecular motor that powers heart contraction by converting chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical force. The power output of the heart is tightly regulated to meet the physiological needs of the body. Recent multiscale studies spanning from molecules to tissues have revealed complex regulatory mechanisms that fine-tune cardiac contraction, in which myosin not only generates power output but also plays an active role in its regulation. Thus, myosin is both shaped by and actively involved in shaping its mechanical environment. Moreover, these studies have shown that cardiac myosin-generated tension affects physiological processes beyond muscle contraction. Here, we review these novel regulatory mechanisms, as well as the roles that myosin-based force generation and mechanotransduction play in development and disease. We describe how key intra- and intermolecular interactions contribute to the regulation of myosin-based contractility and the role of mechanical forces in tuning myosin function. We also discuss the emergence of cardiac myosin as a drug target for diseases including heart failure, leading to the discovery of therapeutics that directly tune myosin contractility. Finally, we highlight some of the outstanding questions that must be addressed to better understand myosin's functions and regulation, and we discuss prospects for translating these discoveries into precision medicine therapeutics targeting contractility and mechanotransduction.

34686337	The cerebral cortex executes highly skilled movement, necessitating that it connects accurately with specific brainstem and spinal motor circuitry. Corticospinal neurons (CSN) must correctly target specific spinal segments, but the basis for this targeting remains unknown. In the accompanying report, we show that segmentally distinct CSN subpopulations are molecularly distinct from early development, identifying candidate molecular controls over segmentally specific axon targeting. Here, we functionally investigate two of these candidate molecular controls, Crim1 and Kelch-like 14 (Klhl14), identifying their critical roles in directing CSN axons to appropriate spinal segmental levels in the white matter prior to axon collateralization. Crim1 and Klhl14 are specifically expressed by distinct CSN subpopulations and regulate their differental white matter projection targeting-Crim1 directs thoracolumbar axon extension, while Klhl14 limits axon extension to bulbar-cervical segments. These molecular regulators of descending spinal projections constitute the first stages of a dual-directional set of complementary controls over CSN diversity for segmentally and functionally distinct circuitry.

34789839	CHD5, a tumor suppressor at 1p36, is frequently lost or silenced in poor prognosis neuroblastoma (NB) and many adult cancers. The role of CHD5 in metastasis is unknown. We confirm that low expression of CHD5 is associated with stage 4 NB. Forced expression of CHD5 in NB cell lines with 1p loss inhibited key aspects of the metastatic cascade in vitro: anchorage-independent growth, migration, and invasion. In vivo, formation of bone marrow and liver metastases developing from intravenously injected NB cells was delayed and decreased by forced CHD5 expression. Genome-wide mRNA sequencing revealed reduction of genes and gene sets associated with metastasis when CHD5 was overexpressed. Known metastasis-suppressing genes preferentially upregulated in CHD5-overexpressing NB cells included PLCL1. In patient NB, low expression of PLCL1was associated with metastatic disease and poor survival. Knockdown of PLCL1 and of p53 in IMR5 NB cells overexpressing CHD5 reversed CHD5-induced inhibition of invasion and migration in vitro. In summary, CHD5 is a metastasis suppressor in NB.

34965432	The EGFR/Erk pathway is triggered by extracellular ligand stimulation, leading to stimulus-dependent dynamics of pathway activity. Although mechanical properties of the microenvironment also affect Erk activity, their effects on Erk signaling dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we characterize how the stiffness of the underlying substratum affects Erk signaling dynamics in mammary epithelial cells. We find that soft microenvironments attenuate Erk signaling, both at steady state and in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Optogenetic manipulation at multiple signaling nodes reveals that intracellular signal transmission is largely unaffected by substratum stiffness. Instead, we find that soft microenvironments decrease EGF receptor (EGFR) expression and alter the amount and spatial distribution of EGF binding at cell membranes. Our data demonstrate that the mechanical microenvironment tunes Erk signaling dynamics via receptor-ligand interactions, underscoring how multiple microenvironmental signals are jointly processed through a highly conserved pathway that regulates tissue development, homeostasis, and disease progression.

34890644	African swine fever (ASF) is a viral hemorrhagic disease that affects domestic pigs and wild boar and is caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV). The ASFV virion contains a long double-stranded DNA genome, which encodes more than 150 proteins. However, the immune escape mechanism and pathogenesis of ASFV remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the pyroptosis execution protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a new binding partner of ASFV-encoded protein S273R (pS273R), which belongs to the SUMO-1 cysteine protease family. Further experiments demonstrated that ASFV pS273R-cleaved swine GSDMD in a manner dependent on its protease activity. ASFV pS273R specifically cleaved GSDMD at G107-A108 to produce a shorter N-terminal fragment of GSDMD consisting of residues 1 to 107 (GSDMD-N1-107). Interestingly, unlike the effect of GSDMD-N1-279 fragment produced by caspase-1-mediated cleavage, the assay of LDH release, cell viability, and virus replication showed that GSDMD-N1-107 did not trigger pyroptosis or inhibit ASFV replication. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism involved in the inhibition of ASFV infection-induced pyroptosis, which highlights an important function of pS273R in inflammatory responses and ASFV replication.

34767771	As cells enter mitosis, chromatin compacts to facilitate chromosome segregation yet remains transcribed. Transcription supercoils DNA to levels that can impede further progression of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) unless it is removed by DNA topoisomerase 1 (TOP1). Using ChIP-seq on mitotic cells, we found that TOP1 is required for RNAPII translocation along genes. The stimulation of TOP1 activity by RNAPII during elongation allowed RNAPII clearance from genes in prometaphase and enabled chromosomal segregation. Disruption of the TOP1-RNAPII interaction impaired RNAPII spiking at promoters and triggered defects in the post-mitotic transcription program. This program includes factors necessary for cell growth, and cells with impaired TOP1-RNAPII interaction are more sensitive to inhibitors of mTOR signaling. We conclude that TOP1 is necessary for assisting transcription during mitosis with consequences for growth and gene expression long after mitosis is completed. In this sense, TOP1 ensures that cellular memory is preserved in subsequent generations.	Topoisomerase 1 activity during mitotic transcription favors the transition from mitosis to G1.

35051417	Store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) is a major mechanism controlling Ca(2+) signaling and Ca(2+)-dependent functions and has been implicated in immunity, cancer, and organ development. SOCE-dependent cytosolic Ca(2+) signals are affected by mitochondrial Ca(2+) transport through several competing mechanisms. However, how these mechanisms interact in shaping Ca(2+) dynamics and regulating Ca(2+)-dependent functions remains unclear. In a recent issue, Yoast et al. shed light on these questions by defining multiple roles of the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter in regulating SOCE, Ca(2+) dynamics, transcription, and lymphocyte activation.

35007531	Plasma and urine glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are long, linear sulfated polysaccharides that have been proposed as potential noninvasive biomarkers for several diseases. However, owing to the analytical complexity associated with the measurement of GAG concentration and disaccharide composition (the so-called GAGome), a reference study of the normal healthy GAGome is currently missing. Here, we prospectively enrolled 308 healthy adults and analyzed their free GAGomes in urine and plasma using a standardized ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry method together with comprehensive demographic and blood chemistry biomarker data. Of 25 blood chemistry biomarkers, we mainly observed weak correlations between the free GAGome and creatinine in urine and hemoglobin or erythrocyte counts in plasma. We found a higher free GAGome concentration - but not a more diverse composition - in males. Partitioned by gender, we also established reference intervals for all detectable free GAGome features in urine and plasma. Finally, we carried out a transference analysis in healthy individuals from two distinct geographical sites, including data from the Lifelines Cohort Study, which validated the reference intervals in urine. Our study is the first large-scale determination of normal free GAGomes reference intervals in plasma and urine and represents a critical resource for future physiology and biomarker research.

34007068	The basic function of beta-arrestin 2 (Arrb2) is to negatively regulate the G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway through facilitating receptor desensitization and internalization. Arrb2 has also been reported to play various roles in cancer pathology including the proliferation, migration, invasion, metastasis, and apoptosis of solid tumors. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumorigenic capacities of Arrb2 have not been elucidated. Here, we show a novel function of Arrb2: Arrb2 facilitates the degradation of HIF-1alpha, which is a master regulator of oxygen homeostasis. We also demonstrate that Arrb2 interacts with HIF-1alpha and stimulates ubiquitin-mediated 26S proteasomal degradation of HIF-1alpha by recruiting PHD2 and pVHL. Overexpression of Arrb2 in human glioblastoma cells suppresses HIF-1alpha signaling, tumor growth, and angiogenesis. Consistent with this antitumorigenic effect of Arrb2, low Arrb2 expression levels correlate with high HIF-1alpha expression and poor glioblastoma patient survival. These results collectively reveal a novel function of Arrb2 in the oxygen-sensing mechanism that directly regulates HIF-1alpha stability in human cancers and suggest Arrb2 as a new potential therapeutic target for glioblastoma.	beta-arrestin 2 stimulates degradation of HIF-1alpha and modulates tumor progression of glioblastoma.

34551307	Synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7) is a high-affinity calcium sensor that is implicated in multiple aspects of synaptic transmission. Here, we study the influence of Syt7 on the climbing fiber (CF) to Purkinje cell (PC) synapse. We find that small facilitation and prominent calcium-dependent recovery from depression at this synapse do not rely on Syt7 and that Syt7 is not normally present in CFs. We expressed Syt7 in CFs to assess the consequences of introducing Syt7 to a synapse that normally lacks Syt7. Syt7 expression does not promote asynchronous release or accelerate recovery from depression. Syt7 decreases the excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) magnitude, consistent with a decrease in the initial probability of release (PR). Syt7 also increases synaptic facilitation to such a large extent that it could not arise solely as an indirect consequence of decreased PR. Thus, the primary consequence of Syt7 expression in CFs, which normally lack Syt7, is to promote synaptic facilitation.

34739850	Antibody transfer via breastmilk represents an evolutionary strategy to boost immunity in early life. Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibodies have been observed in the breastmilk, the functional quality of these antibodies remains unclear. Here, we apply systems serology to characterize SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in maternal serum and breastmilk to compare the functional characteristics of antibodies in these fluids. Distinct SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses are observed in the serum and breastmilk of lactating individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, with a more dominant transfer of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgM into breastmilk. Although IgGs are present in breastmilk, they are functionally attenuated. We observe preferential transfer of antibodies capable of eliciting neutrophil phagocytosis and neutralization compared to other functions, pointing to selective transfer of certain functional antibodies to breastmilk. These data highlight the preferential transfer of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgM to breastmilk, accompanied by select IgG subpopulations, positioned to create a non-pathologic but protective barrier against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

34644579	Polyploidy frequently arises in response to injury, aging, and disease. Despite its prevalence, major gaps exist in our understanding of how polyploid cells alter tissue function. In the adult Drosophila epithelium, wound healing is dependent on the generation of multinucleated polyploid cells resulting in a permanent change in the epithelial architecture. Here, we study how the wound-induced polyploid cells affect tissue function by altering epithelial mechanics. The mechanosensor nonmuscle myosin II is activated and upregulated in wound-induced polyploid cells and persists after healing completes. Polyploidy enhances relative epithelial tension, which is dependent on the endocycle and not cell fusion post injury. Remarkably, the enhanced epithelial tension mimics the relative tension of the lateral muscle fibers, which are permanently severed by the injury. As a result, we found that the wound-induced polyploid cells remodel the epithelium to maintain fly abdominal movements, which may help compensate for lost tissue tension.	The endocycle restores tissue tension in the Drosophila abdomen post wound repair.	Cell reports	0.0	0
35102268	The microtubule cytoskeleton forms complex macromolecular assemblies with a range of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that have fundamental roles in cell architecture, division and motility. Determining how an individual MAP modulates microtubule behaviour is an important step in understanding the physiological roles of various microtubule assemblies. To characterize how MAPs control microtubule properties and functions, we developed an approach allowing for medium-throughput analyses of MAPs in cell-free conditions using lysates of mammalian cells. Our pipeline allows for quantitative as well as ultrastructural analyses of microtubule-MAP assemblies. Analysing 45 bona fide and potential mammalian MAPs, we uncovered previously unknown activities that lead to distinct and unique microtubule behaviours such as microtubule coiling or hook formation, or liquid-liquid phase separation along the microtubule lattice that initiates microtubule branching. We have thus established a powerful tool for a thorough characterization of a wide range of MAPs and MAP variants, thus opening avenues for the determination of mechanisms underlying their physiological roles and pathological implications.

34731607	Cdc42 GTPase rules cell polarity and growth in fission yeast. It is negatively and positively regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), respectively. Active Cdc42-GTP localizes to the poles, where it associates with numerous proteins constituting the polarity module. However, little is known about its downregulation. We describe here that oxidative stress causes Sty1-kinase-dependent Cdc42 inactivation at cell poles. Both the amount of active Cdc42 at tips and cell length inversely correlate with Sty1 activity, explaining the elongated morphology of Deltasty1 cells. We have created stress-blinded cell poles either by eliminating two Cdc42 GAPs or through the constitutive tethering of Gef1 to cell tips, and we biochemically demonstrate that the GAPs Rga3/6 and the GEF Gef1 are direct substrates of Sty1. We propose that phosphorylation of Rga3/6 and Gef1 mediates the Sty1-dependent inhibition of Cdc42 at cell tips, halting polarized growth during stress adaptation.

34678168	AMPA receptors (AMPARs) mediate the majority of excitatory neurotransmission. Their surface expression, trafficking, gating, and pharmacology are regulated by auxiliary subunits. Of the two types of TARP auxiliary subunits, type I TARPs assume activating roles, while type II TARPs serve suppressive functions. We present cryo-EM structures of GluA2 AMPAR in complex with type II TARP gamma5, which reduces steady-state currents, increases single-channel conductance, and slows recovery from desensitization. Regulation of AMPAR function depends on its ligand-binding domain (LBD) interaction with the gamma5 head domain. GluA2-gamma5 complex shows maximum stoichiometry of two TARPs per AMPAR tetramer, being different from type I TARPs but reminiscent of the auxiliary subunit GSG1L. Desensitization of both GluA2-GSG1L and GluA2-gamma5 complexes is accompanied by rupture of LBD dimer interface, while GluA2-gamma5 but not GluA2-GSG1L LBD dimers remain two-fold symmetric. Different structural architectures and desensitization mechanisms of complexes with auxiliary subunits endow AMPARs with broad functional capabilities.

34910905	Presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP) stabilizes synaptic transmission by counteracting impaired neurotransmitter receptor function through neurotransmitter release potentiation. PHP is thought to be triggered by impaired receptor function and to involve a stereotypic signaling pathway. However, here we demonstrate that different receptor perturbations that similarly reduce synaptic transmission result in different responses at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. While receptor inhibition by the glutamate receptor (GluR) antagonist gamma-D-glutamylglycine (gammaDGG) is not compensated by PHP, the GluR inhibitors Philanthotoxin-433 (PhTx) and Gyki-53655 (Gyki) induce compensatory PHP. Intriguingly, PHP triggered by PhTx and Gyki involve separable signaling pathways, including inhibition of distinct GluR subtypes, differential modulation of the active-zone scaffold Bruchpilot, and short-term plasticity. Moreover, while PHP upon Gyki treatment does not require genes promoting PhTx-induced PHP, it involves presynaptic protein kinase D. Thus, synapses not only respond differentially to similar activity impairments, but achieve homeostatic compensation via distinct mechanisms, highlighting the diversity of homeostatic signaling.	Distinct molecular pathways govern presynaptic homeostatic plasticity.	Cell reports	0.0	0
34663907	SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations have greatly reduced COVID-19 cases, but we must continue to develop our understanding of the nature of the disease and its effects on human immunity. Previously, we suggested that a dysregulated STAT3 pathway following SARS-Co-2 infection ultimately leads to PAI-1 activation and cascades of pathologies. The major COVID-19-associated metabolic risks (old age, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and obesity) share high PAI-1 levels and could predispose certain groups to severe COVID-19 complications. In this review article, we describe the common metabolic profile that is shared between all of these high-risk groups and COVID-19. This profile not only involves high levels of PAI-1 and STAT3 as previously described, but also includes low levels of glutamine and NAD(+), coupled with overproduction of hyaluronan (HA). SARS-CoV-2 infection exacerbates this metabolic imbalance and predisposes these patients to the severe pathophysiologies of COVID-19, including the involvement of NETs (neutrophil extracellular traps) and HA overproduction in the lung. While hyperinflammation due to proinflammatory cytokine overproduction has been frequently documented, it is recently recognized that the immune response is markedly suppressed in some cases by the expansion and activity of MDSCs (myeloid-derived suppressor cells) and FoxP3(+) Tregs (regulatory T cells). The metabolomics profiles of severe COVID-19 patients and patients with advanced cancer are similar, and in high-risk patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to aberrant STAT3 activation, which promotes a cancer-like metabolism. We propose that glutamine deficiency and overproduced HA is the central metabolic characteristic of COVID-19 and its high-risk groups. We suggest the usage of glutamine supplementation and the repurposing of cancer drugs to prevent the development of severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

34921839	Deleted in Breast Cancer 1 (DBC1) is an important metabolic sensor. Previous studies have implicated DBC1 in various cellular functions, notably cell proliferation, apoptosis, histone modification, and adipogenesis. However, current reports about the role of DBC1 in tumorigenesis are controversial and designate DBC1 alternatively as a tumor suppressor or a tumor promoter. In the present study, we report that polyoma small T antigen (PyST) associates with DBC1 in mammalian cells, and this interaction leads to the posttranslational downregulation of DBC1 protein levels. When coexpressed, DBC1 overcomes PyST-induced mitotic arrest and promotes the exit of cells from mitosis. Using both transient and stable modes of PyST expression, we also show that cellular DBC1 is subjected to degradation by LKB1, a tumor suppressor and cellular energy sensor kinase, in an AMP kinase-independent manner. Moreover, LKB1 negatively regulates the phosphorylation as well as activity of the prosurvival kinase AKT1 through DBC1 and its downstream pseudokinase substrate, Tribbles 3 (TRB3). Using both transient transfection and stable cell line approaches as well as soft agar assay, we demonstrate that DBC1 has oncogenic potential. In conclusion, our study provides insight into a novel signaling axis that connects LKB1, DBC1, TRB3, and AKT1. We propose that the LKB1-DBC1-AKT1 signaling paradigm may have an important role in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis and consequently tumorigenesis.

34973337	The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) is an inner mitochondrial membrane complex that plays a critical role in intermediary metabolism. Inhibition of the MPC, especially in liver, may have efficacy for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. Herein, we examined the antidiabetic effects of zaprinast and 7ACC2, small molecules which have been reported to act as MPC inhibitors. Both compounds activated a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based MPC reporter assay (reporter sensitive to pyruvate) and potently inhibited pyruvate-mediated respiration in isolated mitochondria. Furthermore, zaprinast and 7ACC2 acutely improved glucose tolerance in diet-induced obese mice in vivo. Although some findings were suggestive of improved insulin sensitivity, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies did not detect enhanced insulin action in response to 7ACC2 treatment. Rather, our data suggest acute glucose-lowering effects of MPC inhibition may be due to suppressed hepatic gluconeogenesis. Finally, we used reporter sensitive to pyruvate to screen a chemical library of drugs and identified 35 potentially novel MPC modulators. Using available evidence, we generated a pharmacophore model to prioritize which hits to pursue. Our analysis revealed carsalam and six quinolone antibiotics, as well as 7ACC1, share a common pharmacophore with 7ACC2. We validated that these compounds are novel inhibitors of the MPC and suppress hepatocyte glucose production and demonstrated that one quinolone (nalidixic acid) improved glucose tolerance in obese mice. In conclusion, these data demonstrate the feasibility of therapeutic targeting of the MPC for treating diabetes and provide scaffolds that can be used to develop potent and novel classes of MPC inhibitors.

34782718	Bladder cancer (BLCA) is the most common malignant tumor of the urinary system and is characterized by high metastatic rates and poor prognosis. The expression of tight junction protein 1 (TJP1) is associated with bladder cancer invasion; however, the mechanism by which TJP1 affects vasculature remodeling remains unknown. In this study, we found that TJP1 expression correlated with tumor angiogenesis and poor overall survival in clinical samples. Furthermore, TJP1 overexpression promoted tumor angiogenesis in BLCA cells and stimulated recruitment of macrophages to tumors by upregulating CCL2 expression. Mechanistically, TJP1 interacted with TWIST1 and enhanced the transcriptional activity of CCL2. The impairment of tumor angiogenesis caused by knockdown of TJP1 was dramatically rescued by overexpression of TWIST1. Furthermore, TJP1 recruited USP2, which deubiquitinated TWIST1, thereby protecting TWIST1 from proteasome-mediated protein degradation. In conclusion, our results suggest that TJP1 controls angiogenesis in BLCA via TWIST1-dependent regulation of CCL2. We demonstrate that TJP1 functions as a scaffold for the interaction between USP2 and TWIST1 and this may provide potential therapeutic targets in bladder cancer.

34605140	While Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) establishes a life-long latent infection in apparently healthy human immunocompetent hosts, immunodeficient individuals are at particular risk to develop lymphoproliferative B-cell malignancies caused by EBV. A key EBV protein is the transcription factor EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2), which initiates B-cell proliferation. Here, we combine biochemical, cellular, and in vivo experiments demonstrating that the mitotic polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) binds to EBNA2, phosphorylates its transactivation domain, and thereby inhibits its biological activity. EBNA2 mutants that impair PLK1 binding or prevent EBNA2 phosphorylation are gain-of-function mutants. They exhibit enhanced transactivation capacities, accelerate the proliferation of infected B cells, and promote the development of monoclonal B-cell lymphomas in infected mice. Thus, PLK1 coordinates the activity of EBNA2 to attenuate the risk of tumor incidences in favor of the establishment of latency in the infected but healthy host.

34686322	Increasing evidence suggests that neurodevelopmental alterations might contribute to increase the susceptibility to develop neurodegenerative diseases. We investigate the occurrence of developmental abnormalities in dopaminergic neurons in a model of Parkinson's disease (PD). We monitor the differentiation of human patient-specific neuroepithelial stem cells (NESCs) into dopaminergic neurons. Using high-throughput image analyses and single-cell RNA sequencing, we observe that the PD-associated LRRK2-G2019S mutation alters the initial phase of neuronal differentiation by accelerating cell-cycle exit with a concomitant increase in cell death. We identify the NESC-specific core regulatory circuit and a molecular mechanism underlying the observed phenotypes. The expression of NR2F1, a key transcription factor involved in neurogenesis, decreases in LRRK2-G2019S NESCs, neurons, and midbrain organoids compared to controls. We also observe accelerated dopaminergic differentiation in vivo in NR2F1-deficient mouse embryos. This suggests a pathogenic mechanism involving the LRRK2-G2019S mutation, where the dynamics of dopaminergic differentiation are modified via NR2F1.

34547291	Sex as a physiologic factor has a strong association with the features of metabolic syndrome. Our previous study showed that loss of the voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 inhibits insulin secretion and leads to hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance in male mice. However, there are significant differences in blood glucose between male and female Hv1-knockout (KO) mice. Here, we investigated the differences in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity between male and female KO mice and how sex steroids contribute to these differences. We found that the fasting blood glucose in female KO mice was visibly lower than that in male KO mice, which was accompanied by hypotestosteronemia. KO mice in both sexes exhibited higher expression of gluconeogenesis-related genes in liver compared with WT mice. Also, the livers from KO males displayed a decrease in glycolysis-related gene expression and an increase in gluconeogenesis-related gene expression compared with KO females. Furthermore, exogenous testosterone supplementation decreased blood glucose levels in male KO mice, as well as enhancing insulin signaling. Taken together, our data demonstrate that knockout of Hv1 results in higher blood glucose levels in male than female mice, despite a decreased insulin secretion in both sexes. This sex-related difference in glucose homeostasis is associated with the glucose metabolism in liver tissue, likely due to the physiological levels of testosterone in KO male mice.	Mice lacking the proton channel Hv1 exhibit sex-specific differences in glucose homeostasis.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0.0	0
34642500	Copy number alterations are crucial for gastric cancer (GC) development. In this study, Tocopherol alpha transfer protein-like (TTPAL) was identified to be highly amplified in our primary GC cohort (30/86). Multivariate analysis showed that high TTPAL expression was correlated with the poor prognosis of GC patients. Ectopic expression of TTPAL promoted GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and promoted murine xenograft tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Conversely, silencing of TTPAL exerted significantly opposite effects in vitro. Moreover, RNA-sequencing and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) followed by liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) identified that TTPAL exerted oncogenic functions via the interaction of Nicotinamide-N-methyl transferase (NNMT) and activated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Collectively, TTPAL plays a pivotal oncogenic role in gastric carcinogenesis through promoting PI3K/AKT pathway via cooperating with NNMT. TTPAL may serve as a prognostic biomarker of patients with GC.	TTPAL promotes gastric tumorigenesis by directly targeting NNMT to activate PI3K/AKT signaling.	Oncogene	0.0	0
34644575	Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of genetic diseases characterized by progressive ataxia and neurodegeneration, often in cerebellar Purkinje neurons. A SCA1 mouse model, Pcp2-ATXN1[30Q]D776, has severe ataxia in absence of progressive Purkinje neuron degeneration and death. Previous RNA-seq analyses identify cerebellar upregulation of the peptide hormone cholecystokinin (Cck) in Pcp2-ATXN1[30Q]D776 mice. Importantly, absence of Cck1 receptor (Cck1R) in Pcp2-ATXN1[30Q]D776 mice confers a progressive disease with Purkinje neuron death. Administration of a Cck1R agonist, A71623, to Pcp2-ATXN1[30Q]D776;Cck(-/-) and Pcp2-AXTN1[82Q] mice dampens Purkinje neuron pathology and associated deficits in motor performance. In addition, A71623 administration improves motor performance of Pcp2-ATXN2[127Q] SCA2 mice. Moreover, the Cck1R agonist A71623 corrects mTORC1 signaling and improves expression of calbindin in cerebella of AXTN1[82Q] and ATXN2[127Q] mice. These results indicate that manipulation of the Cck-Cck1R pathway is a potential therapeutic target for treatment of diseases involving Purkinje neuron degeneration.

34675406	Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine cancer characterized by loss of function TP53 and RB1 mutations in addition to mutations in other oncogenes including MYC. Overexpression of MYC together with Trp53 and Rb1 loss in pulmonary neuroendocrine cells of the mouse lung drives an aggressive neuroendocrine low variant subtype of SCLC. However, the transforming potential of MYC amplification alone on airway epithelium is unclear. Therefore, we selectively and conditionally overexpressed MYC stochastically throughout the airway or specifically in neuroendocrine, club, or alveolar type II cells in the adult mouse lung. We observed that MYC overexpression induced carcinoma in situ which did not progress to invasive disease. The formation of adenoma or SCLC carcinoma in situ was dependent on the cell of origin. In contrast, MYC overexpression combined with conditional deletion of both Trp53 and Rb1 exclusively gave rise to SCLC, irrespective of the cell lineage of origin. However, cell of origin influenced disease latency, metastatic potential, and the transcriptional profile of the SCLC phenotype. Together this reveals that MYC overexpression alone provides a proliferative advantage but when combined with deletion of Trp53 and Rb1 it facilitates the formation of aggressive SCLC from multiple cell lineages.

34971705	Alkylation of DNA and RNA is a potentially toxic lesion that can result in mutations and even cell death. In response to alkylation damage, K63-linked polyubiquitin chains are assembled that localize the Alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase alkB homolog 3-Activating Signal Cointegrator 1 Complex Subunit (ASCC) repair complex to damage sites in the nucleus. The protein ASCC2, a subunit of the ASCC complex, selectively binds K63-linked polyubiquitin chains via its coupling of ubiquitin conjugation to ER degradation (CUE) domain. The basis for polyubiquitin-binding specificity was unclear, because CUE domains in other proteins typically bind a single ubiquitin and do not discriminate among different polyubiquitin linkage types. We report here that the ASCC2 CUE domain selectively binds K63-linked diubiquitin by contacting both the distal and proximal ubiquitin. The ASCC2 CUE domain binds the distal ubiquitin in a manner similar to that reported for other CUE domains bound to a single ubiquitin, whereas the contacts with the proximal ubiquitin are unique to ASCC2. Residues in the N-terminal portion of the ASCC2 alpha1 helix contribute to the binding interaction with the proximal ubiquitin of K63-linked diubiquitin. Mutation of residues within the N-terminal portion of the ASCC2 alpha1 helix decreases ASCC2 recruitment in response to DNA alkylation, supporting the functional significance of these interactions during the alkylation damage response. Our study reveals the versatility of CUE domains in ubiquitin recognition.	The ASCC2 CUE domain in the ALKBH3-ASCC DNA repair complex recognizes adjacent ubiquitins in K63-linked polyubiquitin.

34688660	RNA structure in the influenza A virus (IAV) has been the focus of several studies that have shown connections between conserved secondary structure motifs and their biological function in the virus replication cycle. Questions have arisen on how to best recognize and understand the pandemic properties of IAV strains from an RNA perspective, but determination of the RNA secondary structure has been challenging. Herein, we used chemical mapping to determine the secondary structure of segment 8 viral RNA (vRNA) of the pandemic A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) strain of IAV. Additionally, this long, naturally occurring RNA served as a model to evaluate RNA mapping with 4-thiouridine (4sU) crosslinking. We explored 4-thiouridine as a probe of nucleotides in close proximity, through its incorporation into newly transcribed RNA and subsequent photoactivation. RNA secondary structural features both universal to type A strains and unique to the A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) strain were recognized. 4sU mapping confirmed and facilitated RNA structure prediction, according to several rules: 4sU photocross-linking forms efficiently in the double-stranded region of RNA with some flexibility, in the ends of helices, and across bulges and loops when their structural mobility is permitted. This method highlighted three-dimensional properties of segment 8 vRNA secondary structure motifs and allowed to propose several long-range three-dimensional interactions. 4sU mapping combined with chemical mapping and bioinformatic analysis could be used to enhance the RNA structure determination as well as recognition of target regions for antisense strategies or viral RNA detection.

34968416	T cell immunity is crucial for control of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and has been studied widely on a quantitative level. However, the quality of responses, in particular of CD8(+) T cells, has only been investigated marginally so far. Here, we isolate T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires specific for immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 epitopes restricted to common human Leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules in convalescent individuals. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8(+) T cells are detected up to 12 months after infection. TCR repertoires are diverse, with heterogeneous functional avidity and cytotoxicity toward virus-infected cells, as demonstrated for TCR-engineered T cells. High TCR functionality correlates with gene signatures that, remarkably, could be retrieved for each epitope:HLA combination analyzed. Overall, our data demonstrate that polyclonal and highly functional CD8(+) TCRs-classic features of protective immunity-are recruited upon mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing tools to assess the quality of and potentially restore functional CD8(+) T cell immunity.

34706243	Elevated circulating activity of adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2) is associated with liver fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In the liver of NAFLD patients, ADA2-positive portal macrophages are significantly associated with the degree of liver fibrosis. These liver macrophages are CD14- and CD16-positive and co-express chemokine receptors CCR2, CCR5, and CXCR3, indicating infiltrative monocyte origin. Human circulatory monocytes release ADA2 upon macrophage differentiation in vitro. When stimulated by recombinant human ADA2 (rhADA2), human monocyte-derived macrophages demonstrate upregulation of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes, including PDGF-B, a key pro-fibrotic cytokine. This PDGF-B upregulation is reproduced by inosine, the enzymatic product of ADA2, but not adenosine, and is abolished by E359N, a loss-of-function mutation in ADA2. Finally, rhADA2 also stimulates PDGF-B production from Kupffer cells in primary human liver spheroids. Together, these data suggest that infiltrative monocytes promote fibrogenesis in NAFLD via ADA2-mediated autocrine/paracrine signaling culminating in enhanced PDGF-B production.

34600889	Xylanases produce xylooligosaccharides from xylan and have thus attracted increasing attention for their usefulness in industrial applications. Previously, we demonstrated that the GH11 xylanase XynLC9 from Bacillus subtilis formed xylobiose and xylotriose as the major products with negligible production of xylose when digesting corncob-extracted xylan. Here, we aimed to improve the catalytic performance of XynLC9 via protein engineering. Based on the sequence and structural comparisons of XynLC9 with the xylanases Xyn2 from Trichoderma reesei and Xyn11A from Thermobifida fusca, we identified the N-terminal residues 5-YWQN-8 in XynLC9 as engineering hotspots and subjected this sequence to site saturation and iterative mutagenesis. The mutants W6F/Q7H and N8Y possessed a 2.6- and 1.8-fold higher catalytic activity than XynLC9, respectively, and both mutants were also more thermostable. Kinetic measurements suggested that W6F/Q7H and N8Y had lower substrate affinity, but a higher turnover rate (kcat), which resulted in increased catalytic efficiency than WT XynLC9. Furthermore, the W6F/Q7H mutant displayed a 160% increase in the yield of xylooligosaccharides from corncob-extracted xylan. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the W6F/Q7H and N8Y mutations led to an enlarged volume and surface area of the active site cleft, which provided more space for substrate entry and product release and thus accelerated the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The molecular evolution approach adopted in this study provides the design of a library of sequences that captures functional diversity in a limited number of protein variants.

34625709	Induced waves of calcium fluxes initiate multiple signalling pathways that play an important role in the differentiation and maturation of B-cells. Finely tuned transient Ca(+2) fluxes from the endoplasmic reticulum in response to B-cell receptor (BCR) or chemokine receptor activation are followed by more sustained calcium influxes from the extracellular environment and contribute to the mechanisms responsible for the proliferation of B-cells, their migration within lymphoid organs and their differentiation. Dysregulation of these well-balanced mechanisms in B-cell lymphomas results in uncontrolled cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. Consequently, several cytotoxic drugs (and anti-proliferative compounds) used in standard chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of people with lymphoma target calcium-dependent pathways. Furthermore, ~10% of lymphoma associated mutations are found in genes with functions in calcium-dependent signalling, including those affecting B-cell receptor signalling pathways. In this review, we provide an overview of the Ca(2+)-dependent signalling network and outline the contribution of its key components to B cell lymphomagenesis. We also consider how the oncogenic Epstein-Barr virus, which is causally linked to the pathogenesis of a number of B-cell lymphomas, can modify Ca(2+)-dependent signalling.

34965415	Macrophages are often prominently present in the tumor microenvironment, where distinct macrophage populations can differentially affect tumor progression. Although metabolism influences macrophage function, studies on the metabolic characteristics of ex vivo tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) subsets are rather limited. Using transcriptomic and metabolic analyses, we now reveal that pro-inflammatory major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II(hi) TAMs display a hampered tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, while reparative MHC-II(lo) TAMs show higher oxidative and glycolytic metabolism. Although both TAM subsets rapidly exchange lactate in high-lactate conditions, only MHC-II(lo) TAMs use lactate as an additional carbon source. Accordingly, lactate supports the oxidative metabolism in MHC-II(lo) TAMs, while it decreases the metabolic activity of MHC-II(hi) TAMs. Lactate subtly affects the transcriptome of MHC-II(lo) TAMs, increases L-arginine metabolism, and enhances the T cell suppressive capacity of these TAMs. Overall, our data uncover the metabolic intricacies of distinct TAM subsets and identify lactate as a carbon source and metabolic and functional regulator of TAMs.	Macrophages are metabolically heterogeneous within the tumor microenvironment.

34965437	Newly synthesized glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) undergo extensive remodeling prior to transport to the plasma membrane. GPI-AP remodeling events serve as quality assurance signatures, and complete remodeling of the anchor functions as a transport warrant. Using a genetic approach in yeast cells, we establish that one remodeling event, the removal of ethanolamine-phosphate from mannose 2 via Ted1p (yPGAP5), is essential for cell viability in the absence of the Golgi-localized putative phosphodiesterase Dcr2p. While GPI-APs in which mannose 2 has not been remodeled in dcr2 ted1-deficient cells can still be delivered to the plasma membrane, their presence elicits a unique stress response. Stress is sensed by Mid2p, a constituent of the cell wall integrity pathway, whereupon signal promulgation culminates in activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Our results are consistent with a model in which cellular stress response and chromosome segregation checkpoint pathways are functionally interconnected.

34472665	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple gastric cancer risk loci and several protein-coding susceptibility genes. However, the role of long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) transcribed from these risk loci in gastric cancer development and progression remains to be explored. Here, we functionally characterize a lncRNA, lncPSCA, as a novel tumor suppressor whose expression is fine-regulated by a gastric cancer risk-associated genetic variant. The rs2978980 T > G change in an intronic enhancer of lncPSCA interrupts binding of transcription factor RORA, which down-regulates lncPSCA expression in an allele-specific manner. LncPSCA interacts with DDX5 and promotes DDX5 degradation through ubiquitination. Increased expression of lncPSCA results in low levels of DDX5, less RNA polymerase II (Pol II) binding with DDX5 in the nucleus, thus activating transcription of multiple p53 signaling genes by Pol II. These findings highlight the importance of functionally annotating lncRNAs in GWAS risk loci and the great potential of modulating lncRNAs as innovative cancer therapy.

34508779	Molecular motors such as kinesin and myosin often work in groups to generate the directed movements and forces critical for many biological processes. Although much is known about how individual motors generate force and movement, surprisingly, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the macroscopic mechanics generated by multiple motors. For example, the observation that a saturating number, N, of myosin heads move an actin filament at a rate that is influenced by actin-myosin attachment and detachment kinetics is accounted for neither experimentally nor theoretically. To better understand the emergent mechanics of actin-myosin mechanochemistry, we use an in vitro motility assay to measure and correlate the N-dependence of actin sliding velocities, actin-activated ATPase activity, force generation against a mechanical load, and the calcium sensitivity of thin filament velocities. Our results show that both velocity and ATPase activity are strain dependent and that velocity becomes maximized with the saturation of myosin-binding sites on actin at a value that is 40% dependent on attachment kinetics and 60% dependent on detachment kinetics. These results support a chemical thermodynamic model for ensemble motor mechanochemistry and imply molecularly explicit mechanisms within this framework, challenging the assumption of independent force generation.	Velocity of myosin-based actin sliding depends on attachment and detachment kinetics and reaches a maximum when myosin-binding sites on actin saturate.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0.0	0
34818558	Endogenous metabolites, environmental agents, and therapeutic drugs promote formation of covalent DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs). Persistent DPCs compromise genome integrity and are eliminated by multiple repair pathways. Aberrant Top1-DNA crosslinks, or Top1ccs, are processed by Tdp1 and Wss1 functioning in parallel pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It remains obscure how cells choose between diverse mechanisms of DPC repair. Here, we show that several SUMO biogenesis factors (Ulp1, Siz2, Slx5, and Slx8) control repair of Top1cc or an analogous DPC lesion. Genetic analysis reveals that SUMO promotes Top1cc processing in the absence of Tdp1 but has an inhibitory role if cells additionally lack Wss1. In the tdp1Delta wss1Delta mutant, the E3 SUMO ligase Siz2 stimulates sumoylation in the vicinity of the DPC, but not SUMO conjugation to Top1. This Siz2-dependent sumoylation inhibits alternative DPC repair mechanisms, including Ddi1. Our findings suggest that SUMO tunes available repair pathways to facilitate faithful DPC repair.

34569705	The migratory cardiac neural crest cells (CNCCs) contribute greatly to cardiovascular development. A thorough understanding of the cell lineages, developmental chronology, and transcriptomic states of CNCC derivatives during normal development is essential for deciphering the pathogenesis of CNCC-associated congenital anomalies. Here, we perform single-cell transcriptomic sequencing of 34,131 CNCC-derived cells in mouse hearts covering eight developmental stages between E10.5 and P7. We report the presence of CNCC-derived mural cells that comprise pericytes and microvascular smooth muscle cells (mVSMCs). Furthermore, we identify the transition from the CNCC-derived pericytes to mVSMCs and the key regulators over the transition. In addition, our data support that many CNCC derivatives had already committed or differentiated to a specific lineage when migrating into the heart. We explore the spatial distribution of some critical CNCC-derived subpopulations with single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization. Finally, we computationally reconstruct the differentiation path and regulatory dynamics of CNCC derivatives.

34678311	Coagulopathy is associated with both inflammation and infection, including infections with novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, the causative agent Coagulopathy is associated with both inflammation and infection, including infection with novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Clot formation is promoted via cAMP-mediated secretion of von Willebrand factor (vWF), which fine-tunes the process of hemostasis. The exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) is a ubiquitously expressed intracellular cAMP receptor that plays a regulatory role in suppressing inflammation. To assess whether EPAC could regulate vWF release during inflammation, we utilized our EPAC1-null mouse model and revealed increased secretion of vWF in endotoxemic mice in the absence of the EPAC1 gene. Pharmacological inhibition of EPAC1 in vitro mimicked the EPAC1-/- phenotype. In addition, EPAC1 regulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha-triggered vWF secretion from human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a manner dependent upon inflammatory effector molecules PI3K and endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Furthermore, EPAC1 activation reduced inflammation-triggered vWF release, both in vivo and in vitro. Our data delineate a novel regulatory role for EPAC1 in vWF secretion and shed light on the potential development of new strategies to control thrombosis during inflammation.

34756888	"Preserving optimal mitochondrial function is critical in the heart, which is the most ATP-avid organ in the body. Recently, we showed that global deficiency of the nuclear receptor RORalpha in the ""staggerer"" mouse exacerbates angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and compromises cardiomyocyte mitochondrial function. However, the mechanisms underlying these observations have not been defined previously. Here, we used pharmacological and genetic gain- and loss-of-function tools to demonstrate that RORalpha regulates cardiomyocyte mitophagy to preserve mitochondrial abundance and function. We found that cardiomyocyte mitochondria in staggerer mice with lack of functional RORalpha were less numerous and exhibited fewer mitophagy events than those in WT controls. The hearts of our novel cardiomyocyte-specific RORalpha KO mouse line demonstrated impaired contractile function, enhanced oxidative stress, increased apoptosis, and reduced autophagic flux relative to Cre(-) littermates. We found that cardiomyocyte mitochondria in ""staggerer"" mice with lack of functional RORalpha were upregulated by hypoxia, a classical inducer of mitophagy. The loss of RORalpha blunted mitophagy and broadly compromised mitochondrial function in normoxic and hypoxic conditions in vivo and in vitro. We also show that RORalpha is a direct transcriptional regulator of the mitophagy mediator caveolin-3 in cardiomyocytes and that enhanced expression of RORalpha increases caveolin-3 abundance and enhances mitophagy. Finally, knockdown of RORalpha impairs cardiomyocyte mitophagy, compromises mitochondrial function, and induces apoptosis, but these defects could be rescued by caveolin-3 overexpression. Collectively, these findings reveal a novel role for RORalpha in regulating mitophagy through caveolin-3 and expand our currently limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying RORalpha-mediated cardioprotection."

35145222	Many cancers have an unusual dependence on glutamine. However, most previous studies have focused on the contribution of glutamine to metabolic building blocks and the energy supply. Here, we report that cancer cells with aberrant expression of glutamate decarboxylase 1 (GAD1) rewire glutamine metabolism for the synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-a prominent neurotransmitter-in non-nervous tissues. An analysis of clinical samples reveals that increased GABA levels predict poor prognosis. Mechanistically, we identify a cancer-intrinsic pathway through which GABA activates the GABAB receptor to inhibit GSK-3beta activity, leading to enhanced beta-catenin signalling. This GABA-mediated beta-catenin activation both stimulates tumour cell proliferation and suppresses CD8(+) T cell intratumoural infiltration, such that targeting GAD1 or GABABR in mouse models overcomes resistance to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Our findings uncover a signalling role for tumour-derived GABA beyond its classic function as a neurotransmitter that can be targeted pharmacologically to reverse immunosuppression.

34610303	A hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is hepatic resistance to insulin's glucose-lowering effects. The serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated family of protein kinases (SGK) is activated downstream of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) in response to insulin in parallel to AKT. Surprisingly, despite an identical substrate recognition motif to AKT, which drives insulin sensitivity, pathological accumulation of SGK1 drives insulin resistance. Liver-specific Sgk1-knockout (Sgk1(Lko)) mice display improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and are protected from hepatic steatosis when fed a high-fat diet. Sgk1 promotes insulin resistance by inactivating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) via phosphorylation on inhibitory site AMPKalpha(Ser485/491). We demonstrate that SGK1 is dominant among SGK family kinases in regulation of insulin sensitivity, as Sgk1, Sgk2, and Sgk3 triple-knockout mice have similar increases in hepatic insulin sensitivity. In aggregate, these data suggest that targeting hepatic SGK1 may have therapeutic potential in T2D.

34905386	Chronic metabolic inflammation is a key feature of obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes. Here, we showed that altered regulation of the Ca(2+) channel inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) was an adipocyte-intrinsic event involved in the emergence and propagation of inflammatory signaling and the resulting insulin resistance. Inflammation induced by cytokine exposure in vitro or by obesity in vivo led to increases in the abundance and activity of IP3Rs and in the phosphorylation of the Ca(2+)-dependent kinase CaMKII in adipocytes in a manner dependent on the kinase JNK. In mice, adipocyte-specific loss of IP3R1/2 protected against adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance, despite the mice exhibiting substantial diet-induced weight gain. Thus, this work suggests that increased IP3R activity is a key link between obesity, inflammation, and insulin resistance. These data also suggest that approaches to target IP3R-mediated Ca(2+) homeostasis in adipocytes may offer new therapeutic opportunities against metabolic diseases, especially because GWAS studies also implicate this locus in human obesity.

34879268	Ventral subiculum (vSUB) is integral to the regulation of stress and reward; however, the intrinsic connectivity and synaptic properties of the inhibitory local circuit are poorly understood. Neurexin-3 (Nrxn3) is highly expressed in hippocampal inhibitory neurons, but its function at inhibitory synapses has remained elusive. Using slice electrophysiology, imaging, and single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify multiple roles for Nrxn3 at GABAergic parvalbumin (PV) interneuron synapses made onto vSUB regular-spiking (RS) and burst-spiking (BS) principal neurons. Surprisingly, we find that intrinsic connectivity of vSUB and synaptic function of Nrxn3 in vSUB are sexually dimorphic. We reveal that PVs make preferential contact with RS neurons in male mice, but BS neurons in female mice. Furthermore, we determine that despite comparable Nrxn3 isoform expression in male and female PV neurons, Nrxn3 knockout impairs synapse density, postsynaptic strength, and inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) amplitude at PV-RS synapses in males, but enhances presynaptic release and IPSC amplitude in females.

34758297	Sphingomyelin (SM) is a mammalian lipid mainly distributed in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM). We show that peripheral myelin protein 2 (PMP2), a member of the fatty-acid-binding protein (FABP) family, can localize at the PM and controls the transbilayer distribution of SM. Genetic screening with genome-wide small hairpin RNA libraries identifies PMP2 as a protein involved in the transbilayer movement of SM. A biochemical assay demonstrates that PMP2 is a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2)-binding protein. PMP2 induces the tubulation of model membranes in a PI(4,5)P2-dependent manner, accompanied by the modification of the transbilayer membrane distribution of lipids. In the PM of PMP2-overexpressing cells, inner-leaflet SM is increased whereas outer-leaflet SM is reduced. PMP2 is a causative protein of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT).

34889941	Prostate cancer aggressiveness and metastatic potential are influenced by gene expression and genomic aberrations, features that can be influenced by the 3D structure of chromosomes inside the nucleus.Using chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), we conducted a systematic genome architecture comparison on a cohort of cell lines that model prostate cancer progression, from normal epithelium to bone metastasis. We describe spatial compartment identity (A-open versus B-closed) changes with progression in these cell lines and their relation to gene expression changes in both cell lines and patient samples. In particular, 48 gene clusters switch from the B to the A compartment, including androgen receptor, WNT5A, and CDK14. These switches are accompanied by changes in the structure, size, and boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs). Further, compartment changes in chromosome 21 are exacerbated with progression and may explain, in part, the genesis of the TMPRSS2-ERG translocation.These results suggest that discrete 3D genome structure changes play a deleterious role in prostate cancer progression..

34932372	Ligand binding to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as the alpha2a-adrenergic receptor (alpha2aAR), results in the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins, which consist of functionally distinct Galpha subunits and Gbetagamma dimers. alpha2aAR-dependent inhibition of synaptic transmission regulates functions such as spontaneous locomotor activity, anesthetic sparing, and working memory enhancement and requires the soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex, a Gbetagamma effector. To understand how the Gbetagamma-SNARE complex underlies the alpha2aAR-dependent inhibition of synaptic transmission, we examined the specificity of Gbetagamma subunits for the SNARE complex in adrenergic neurons, in which auto-alpha2aARs respond to epinephrine released from these neurons, and nonadrenergic neurons, in which hetero-alpha2aARs respond to epinephrine released from other neurons. We performed a quantitative, targeted multiple reaction monitoring proteomic analysis of Gbeta and Ggamma subunits bound to the SNARE complex in synaptosomes from mouse brains. In the absence of stimulation of auto-alpha2aARs, Gbeta1 and Ggamma3 interacted with the SNARE complex. However, Gbeta1, Gbeta2, and Ggamma3 were found in the complex when auto-alpha2aARs were activated by epinephrine. Further understanding of the specific usage of distinct Gbetagamma subunits in vivo may provide insights into the homeostatic regulation of synaptic transmission and the mechanisms of dysfunction that occur in neurological diseases.

34818544	Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are characterized by high rates of recurrence and poor clinical outcomes. Deregulated E3 ligases are involved in breast cancer pathogenesis and progression, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we find that F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 16 (FBXL16) acts as a tumor suppressor in TNBCs. FBXL16 directly binds to HIF1alpha and induces its ubiquitination and degradation, regardless of the tumor microenvironment, resulting in blockade of the HIF1alpha-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis features of breast cancer. In TNBCs, FBXL16 expression is downregulated by the p38/miR-135b-3p axis, and loss of FBXL16 expression restores HIF1alpha-mediated metastatic features of breast cancer. Low expression of FBXL16 is associated with high-grade and lymph node-positive tumors and poor overall survival of breast cancer. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that modulation of FBXL16 expression may offer a favorable strategy for treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer, including TNBCs.

34887515	Extracellular vesicles and exomere nanoparticles are under intense investigation as sources of clinically relevant cargo. Here we report the discovery of a distinct extracellular nanoparticle, termed supermere. Supermeres are morphologically distinct from exomeres and display a markedly greater uptake in vivo compared with small extracellular vesicles and exomeres. The protein and RNA composition of supermeres differs from small extracellular vesicles and exomeres. Supermeres are highly enriched with cargo involved in multiple cancers (glycolytic enzymes, TGFBI, miR-1246, MET, GPC1 and AGO2), Alzheimer's disease (APP) and cardiovascular disease (ACE2, ACE and PCSK9). The majority of extracellular RNA is associated with supermeres rather than small extracellular vesicles and exomeres. Cancer-derived supermeres increase lactate secretion, transfer cetuximab resistance and decrease hepatic lipids and glycogen in vivo. This study identifies a distinct functional nanoparticle replete with potential circulating biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a host of human diseases.

34799660	Anti-tubulin agents, such as paclitaxel, have been used extensively for treatment of several types of cancer, including ovarian, lung, breast, and pancreatic cancers. Despite their wide use in cancer treatment, however, patient response is highly variable and drug resistance remains a major clinical issue. Protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) plays a critical role in immune response to viral infection. We identified PKR as a phospho-protein in response to anti-tubulin agents and this phosphorylation occurs independent of its own kinase activity. PKR is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) during anti-tubulin treatment and unperturbed mitosis and that PKR regulates mitotic progression in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Furthermore, inactivation of PKR confers resistance to paclitaxel in ovarian and breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. PKR expression levels and activity are decreased in chemotherapeutic recurrent ovarian cancer patients. Mechanistically, our findings suggest that PKR controls paclitaxel chemosensitivity through repressing Bcl2 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of Bcl2 with FDA-approved agent venetoclax overcomes paclitaxel resistance in preclinical animal models of ovarian cancer. Our results suggest that PKR is a critical determinant of paclitaxel cytotoxicity and that PKR-Bcl2 axis as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of recurrent drug-resistant ovarian tumors.

34715131	During signal transduction, the G protein, Galphaq, binds and activates phospholipase C-beta isozymes. Several diseases have been shown to manifest upon constitutively activating mutation of Galphaq, such as uveal melanoma. Therefore, methods are needed to directly inhibit Galphaq. Previously, we demonstrated that a peptide derived from a helix-turn-helix (HTH) region of PLC-beta3 (residues 852-878) binds Galphaq with low micromolar affinity and inhibits Galphaq by competing with full-length PLC-beta isozymes for binding. Since the HTH peptide is unstructured in the absence of Galphaq, we hypothesized that embedding the HTH in a folded protein might stabilize the binding-competent conformation and further improve the potency of inhibition. Using the molecular modeling software Rosetta, we searched the Protein Data Bank for proteins with similar HTH structures near their surface. The candidate proteins were computationally docked against Galphaq, and their surfaces were redesigned to stabilize this interaction. We then used yeast surface display to affinity mature the designs. The most potent design bound Galphaq/i with high affinity in vitro (KD = 18 nM) and inhibited activation of PLC-beta isozymes in HEK293 cells. We anticipate that our genetically encoded inhibitor will help interrogate the role of Galphaq in healthy and disease model systems. Our work demonstrates that grafting interaction motifs into folded proteins is a powerful approach for generating inhibitors of protein-protein interactions.

34592154	Spt4 is a transcription elongation factor with homologs in organisms with nucleosomes. Structural and in vitro studies implicate Spt4 in transcription through nucleosomes, and yet the in vivo function of Spt4 is unclear. Here, we assess the precise position of Spt4 during transcription and the consequences of the loss of Spt4 on RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) dynamics and nucleosome positioning in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the absence of Spt4, the spacing between gene-body nucleosomes increases and RNAPII accumulates upstream of the nucleosomal dyad, most dramatically at nucleosome +2. Spt4 associates with elongating RNAPII early in transcription, and its association dynamically changes depending on nucleosome positions. Together, our data show that Spt4 regulates early elongation dynamics, participates in co-transcriptional nucleosome positioning, and promotes RNAPII movement through the gene-body nucleosomes, especially the +2 nucleosome.	Spt4 facilitates the movement of RNA polymerase II through the +2 nucleosomal barrier.	Cell reports	0.0	0

34529975	Resistance to the extended-spectrum cephalosporin ceftriaxone in the pathogenic bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae is conferred by mutations in penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP2), the lethal target of the antibiotic, but how these mutations exert their effect at the molecular level is unclear. Using solution NMR, X-ray crystallography, and isothermal titration calorimetry, we report that WT PBP2 exchanges dynamically between a low-affinity state with an extended beta3-beta4 loop conformation and a high-affinity state with an inward beta3-beta4 loop conformation. Histidine-514, which is located at the boundary of the beta4 strand, plays an important role during the exchange between these two conformational states. We also find that mutations present in PBP2 from H041, a ceftriaxone-resistant strain of N. gonorrhoeae, increase resistance to ceftriaxone by destabilizing the inward beta3-beta4 loop conformation or stabilizing the extended beta3-beta4 loop conformation to favor the low-affinity drug-binding state. These observations reveal a unique mechanism for ceftriaxone resistance, whereby mutations in PBP2 lower the proportion of target molecules in the high-affinity drug-binding state and thus reduce inhibition at lower drug concentrations.

34525351	Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) are critical mediators of self-tolerance, but they can also limit effective anti-tumor immunity. Although under homeostasis a small fraction of Treg cells in lymphoid organs express the putative checkpoint molecule Tim-3, this protein is expressed by a much larger proportion of tumor-infiltrating Treg cells. Using a mouse model that drives cell-type-specific inducible Tim-3 expression, we show that expression of Tim-3 by Treg cells is sufficient to drive Treg cells to a more effector-like phenotype, resulting in increases in suppressive activity, effector T cell exhaustion, and tumor growth. We also show that T-reg-cell-specific inducible deletion of Tim-3 enhances anti-tumor immunity. Enhancement of Treg cell function by Tim-3 is strongly correlated with increased expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and a shift to a more glycolytic metabolic phenotype. Our data demonstrate that Tim-3(+) Treg cells may be a relevant therapeutic target cell type for the treatment of cancer.

34592170	The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lineages that are more transmissible and resistant to currently approved antibody therapies poses a considerable challenge to the clinical treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Therefore, the need for ongoing discovery efforts to identify broadly reactive monoclonal antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is of utmost importance. Here, we report a panel of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies isolated using the linking B cell receptor to antigen specificity through sequencing (LIBRA-seq) technology from an individual who recovered from COVID-19. Of these antibodies, 54042-4 shows potent neutralization against authentic SARS-CoV-2 viruses, including variants of concern (VOCs). A cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of 54042-4 in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike reveals an epitope composed of residues that are highly conserved in currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Further, 54042-4 possesses uncommon genetic and structural characteristics that distinguish it from other potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Together, these findings provide motivation for the development of 54042-4 as a lead candidate to counteract current and future SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.

34623384	"The cystine-glutamate antiporter, xCT, supports a glutathione synthesis program enabling cancer cells to cope with metabolically stressful microenvironments. Up-regulated xCT, in combination with glutaminolysis, leads to increased extracellular glutamate, which promotes invasive behavior by activating metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3). Here we show that activation of mGluR3 in breast cancer cells activates Rab27-dependent release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which can transfer invasive characteristics to ""recipient"" tumor cells. These EVs contain mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is packaged via a PINK1-dependent mechanism. We highlight mtDNA as a key EV cargo necessary and sufficient for intercellular transfer of invasive behavior by activating Toll-like receptor 9 in recipient cells, and this involves increased endosomal trafficking of pro-invasive receptors. We propose that an EV-mediated mechanism, through which altered cellular metabolism in one cell influences endosomal trafficking in other cells, is key to generation and dissemination of pro-invasive microenvironments during mammary carcinoma progression."

35090599	We have used a combination of chemical genetics, chromatin proteomics, and imaging to map the earliest chromatin transactions during vertebrate cell entry into mitosis. Chicken DT40 CDK1(as) cells undergo synchronous mitotic entry within 15 min following release from a 1NM-PP1-induced arrest in late G2. In addition to changes in chromatin association with nuclear pores and the nuclear envelope, earliest prophase is dominated by changes in the association of ribonucleoproteins with chromatin, particularly in the nucleolus, where pre-rRNA processing factors leave chromatin significantly before RNA polymerase I. Nuclear envelope barrier function is lost early in prophase, and cytoplasmic proteins begin to accumulate on the chromatin. As a result, outer kinetochore assembly appears complete by nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD). Most interphase chromatin proteins remain associated with chromatin until NEBD, after which their levels drop sharply.

34496245	Sensory cues that precede reward acquire predictive (expected value) and incentive (drive reward-seeking action) properties. Mesolimbic dopamine neurons' responses to sensory cues correlate with both expected value and reward-seeking action. This has led to the proposal that phasic dopamine responses may be sufficient to inform value-based decisions, elicit actions, and/or induce motivational states; however, causal tests are incomplete. Here, we show that direct dopamine neuron stimulation, both calibrated to physiological and greater intensities, at the time of reward can be sufficient to induce and maintain reward seeking (reinforcing) although replacement of a cue with stimulation is insufficient to induce reward seeking or act as an informative cue. Stimulation of descending cortical inputs, one synapse upstream, are sufficient for reinforcement and cues to future reward. Thus, physiological activation of mesolimbic dopamine neurons can be sufficient for reinforcing properties of reward without being sufficient for the predictive and incentive properties of cues.

35022539	Thirteen percent of cancers worldwide are associated with viral infections. While many human oncogenic viruses are widely endemic, very few infected individuals develop cancer. This raises the question why oncogenic viruses encode viral oncogenes if they can replicate and spread between human hosts without causing cancer. Interestingly, viral infection triggers innate immune signaling pathways that in turn activate tumor suppressors such as p53, suggesting that tumor suppressors may have evolved not primarily to prevent cancer, but to thwart viral infection. Here, we summarize and compare several major immune evasion strategies used by viral and non-viral cancers, with a focus on oncogenes that play dual roles in promoting tumorigenicity and immune evasion. By highlighting important and illustrative examples of how oncogenic viruses evade the immune system, we aim to shed light on how non-viral cancers avoid immune detection. Further study and understanding of how viral and non-viral oncogenes impact immune function could lead to improved strategies to combine molecular therapies targeting oncoproteins in combination with immunomodulators.

34798070	ARL5B, an ARF-like small GTPase localized to the trans-Golgi, is known for regulating endosome-Golgi trafficking and promoting the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Although a few interacting partners have been identified, the mechanism of the shuttling of ARL5B between the Golgi membrane and the cytosol is still obscure. Here, using GFP-binding protein (GBP) pull-down followed by mass spectrometry, we identified heat shock cognate protein (HSC70) as an additional interacting partner of ARL5B. Our pull-down and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)-based studies suggested that HSC70 binds to ARL5B in an ADP-dependent manner. Additionally, we showed that the N-terminal helix and the nucleotide status of ARL5B contribute to its recognition by HSC70. The confocal microscopy and cell fractionation studies in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells revealed that the depletion of HSC70 reduces the localization of ARL5B to the Golgi. Using in vitro reconstitution approach, we provide evidence that HSC70 fine-tunes the association of ARL5B with Golgi membrane. Finally, we demonstrated that the interaction between ARL5B and HSC70 is important for the localization of cation independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CIMPR) at Golgi. Collectively, we propose a mechanism by which HSC70, a constitutively expressed chaperone, modulates the Golgi association of ARL5B, which in turn has implications for the Golgi-associated functions of this GTPase.

34710371	Legumains, also known as asparaginyl endopeptidases (AEPs), cleave peptide bonds after Asn/Asp (Asx) residues. In plants, certain legumains also have ligase activity that catalyzes biosynthesis of Asx-containing cyclic peptides. An example is the biosynthesis of MCoTI-I/II, a squash family-derived cyclic trypsin inhibitor, which involves splicing to remove the N-terminal prodomain and then N-to-C-terminal cyclization of the mature domain. To identify plant legumains responsible for the maturation of these cyclic peptides, we have isolated and characterized a legumain involved in splicing, McPAL1, from Momordica cochinchinensis (Cucurbitaceae) seeds. Functional studies show that recombinantly expressed McPAL1 displays a pH-dependent, trimodal enzymatic profile. At pH 4 to 6, McPAL1 selectively catalyzed Asp-ligation and Asn-cleavage, but at pH 6.5 to 8, Asn-ligation predominated. With peptide substrates containing N-terminal Asn and C-terminal Asp, such as is found in precursors of MCoTI-I/II, McPAL1 mediates proteolysis at the Asn site and then ligation at the Asp site at pH 5 to 6. Also, McPAL1 is an unusually stable legumain that is tolerant of heat and high pH. Together, our results support that McPAL1 is a splicing legumain at acidic pH that can mediate biosynthesis of MCoTI-I/II. We purport that the high thermal and pH stability of McPAL1 could have applications for protein engineering.

34973340	WHIM syndrome is a rare immunodeficiency disorder that is characterized by warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis. While several gain-of-function mutations that lead to C-terminal truncations, frame shifts and point mutations in the chemokine receptor CXCR4 have been identified in WHIM syndrome patients, the functional effect of these mutations are not fully understood. Here, we report on a new WHIM syndrome mutation that results in a frame shift within the codon for Ser339 (S339fs5) and compare the properties of S339fs5 with wild-type CXCR4 and a previously identified WHIM syndrome mutant, R334X. The S339fs5 and R334X mutants exhibited significantly increased signaling compared to wild-type CXCR4 including agonist-promoted calcium flux and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase activation. This increase is at least partially due to a significant decrease in agonist-promoted phosphorylation, beta-arrestin binding, and endocytosis of S339fs5 and R334X compared with wild-type CXCR4. Interestingly, there were also significant differences in receptor degradation, with S339fs5 having a very high basal level of degradation compared with that of R334X and wild-type CXCR4. In contrast to wild-type CXCR4, both R334X and S339fs5 were largely insensitive to CXCL12-promoted degradation. Moreover, while basal and agonist-promoted degradation of wild-type CXCR4 was effectively inhibited by the CXCR4 antagonist TE-14016, this had no effect on the degradation of the WHIM mutants. Taken together, these studies identify a new WHIM syndrome mutant, CXCR4-S339fs5, which promotes enhanced signaling, reduced phosphorylation, beta-arrestin binding and endocytosis, and a very high basal rate of degradation that is not protected by antagonist treatment.

34731631	Mechanistic insights into the role of the human microbiome in the predisposition to and treatment of disease are limited by the lack of methods to precisely add or remove microbial strains or genes from complex communities. Here, we demonstrate that engineered bacteriophage M13 can be used to deliver DNA to Escherichia coli within the mouse gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Delivery of a programmable exogenous CRISPR-Cas9 system enables the strain-specific depletion of fluorescently marked isogenic strains during competitive colonization and genomic deletions that encompass the target gene in mice colonized with a single strain. Multiple mechanisms allow E. coli to escape targeting, including loss of the CRISPR array or even the entire CRISPR-Cas9 system. These results provide a robust and experimentally tractable platform for microbiome editing, a foundation for the refinement of this approach to increase targeting efficiency, and a proof of concept for the extension to other phage-bacterial pairs of interest.

34748728	The molybdenum/tungsten-bis-pyranopterin guanine dinucleotide family of formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) plays roles in several metabolic pathways ranging from carbon fixation to energy harvesting because of their reaction with a wide variety of redox partners. Indeed, this metabolic plasticity results from the diverse structures, cofactor content, and substrates used by partner subunits interacting with the catalytic hub. Here, we unveiled two noncanonical FDHs in Bacillus subtilis, which are organized into two-subunit complexes with unique features, ForCE1 and ForCE2. We show that the formate oxidoreductase catalytic subunit interacts with an unprecedented partner subunit, formate oxidoreductase essential subunit, and that its amino acid sequence within the active site deviates from the consensus residues typically associated with FDH activity, as a histidine residue is naturally substituted with a glutamine. The formate oxidoreductase essential subunit mediates the utilization of menaquinone as an electron acceptor as shown by the formate:menadione oxidoreductase activity of both enzymes, their copurification with menaquinone, and the distinctive detection of a protein-bound neutral menasemiquinone radical by multifrequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments on the purified enzymes. Moreover, EPR characterization of both FDHs reveals the presence of several [Fe-S] clusters with distinct relaxation properties and a weakly anisotropic Mo(V) EPR signature, consistent with the characteristic molybdenum/bis-pyranopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor of this enzyme family. Altogether, this work enlarges our knowledge of the FDH family by identifying a noncanonical FDH, which differs in terms of architecture, amino acid conservation around the molybdenum cofactor, and reactivity.

35032548	With the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronaviruses have begun to attract great attention across the world. Of the known human coronaviruses, however, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the most lethal. Coronavirus proteins can be divided into three groups: nonstructural proteins, structural proteins, and accessory proteins. While the number of each of these proteins varies greatly among different coronaviruses, accessory proteins are most closely related to the pathogenicity of the virus. We found for the first time that the ORF3 accessory protein of MERS-CoV, which closely resembles the ORF3a proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, has the ability to induce apoptosis in cells in a dose-dependent manner. Through bioinformatics analysis and validation, we revealed that ORF3 is an unstable protein and has a shorter half-life in cells compared to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a proteins. After screening, we identified a host E3 ligase, HUWE1, that specifically induces MERS-CoV ORF3 protein ubiquitination and degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This results in the diminished ability of ORF3 to induce apoptosis, which might partially explain the lower spread of MERS-CoV compared to other coronaviruses. In summary, this study reveals a pathological function of MERS-CoV ORF3 protein and identifies a potential host antiviral protein, HUWE1, with an ability to antagonize MERS-CoV pathogenesis by inducing ORF3 degradation, thus enriching our knowledge of the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and suggesting new targets and strategies for clinical development of drugs for MERS-CoV treatment.

34515402	The ubiquitin system is an important part of the host cellular defense program during bacterial infection. This is in particular evident for a number of bacteria including Salmonella Typhimurium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis which-inventively as part of their invasion strategy or accidentally upon rupture of seized host endomembranes-become exposed to the host cytosol. Ubiquitylation is involved in the detection and clearance of these bacteria as well as in the activation of innate immune and inflammatory signaling. Remarkably, all these defense responses seem to emanate from a dense layer of ubiquitin which coats the invading pathogens. In this review, we focus on the diverse group of host cell E3 ubiquitin ligases that help to tailor this ubiquitin coat. In particular, we address how the divergent ubiquitin conjugation mechanisms of these ligases contribute to the complexity of the anti-bacterial coating and the recruitment of different ubiquitin-binding effectors. We also discuss the activation and coordination of the different E3 ligases and which strategies bacteria evolved to evade the activities of the host ubiquitin system.

34910904	The brain selectively allocates attention from a continuous stream of sensory input. This process is typically attributed to computations in distinct regions of the forebrain and midbrain. Here, we explore whether cerebellar Purkinje cells encode information about the selection of sensory inputs and could thereby contribute to non-motor forms of learning. We show that complex spikes of individual Purkinje cells change the sensory modality they encode to reflect changes in the perceived salience of sensory input. Comparisons with mouse models deficient in cerebellar plasticity suggest that changes in complex spike activity instruct potentiation of Purkinje cells simple spike firing, which is required for efficient learning. Our findings suggest that during learning, climbing fibers do not directly guide motor output, but rather contribute to a general readiness to act via changes in simple spike activity, thereby bridging the sequence from non-motor to motor functions.

34525367	Many species have cuticular striations that play a range of roles, from pollinator attraction to surface wettability. In Hibiscus trionum, the striations span multiple cells at the base of the petal to form a pattern that produces a type of iridescence. It is postulated, using theoretical models, that the pattern of striations could result from mechanical instabilities. By combining the application of mechanical stress with high-resolution imaging, we demonstrate that the cuticle buckles to create a striated pattern. Through mechanical modeling and cryo-SEM fractures, we show that the cuticle behaves like a bilayer system with a stiff film on a compliant substrate. The pattern of buckling aligns with the direction of the stress to create a larger-scale pattern. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the formation of tissue-wide patterns in living organisms.	Mechanical buckling can pattern the light-diffracting cuticle of Hibiscus trionum.

34706227	Astrocyte-derived cholesterol supports brain cells under physiological conditions. However, in demyelinating lesions, astrocytes downregulate cholesterol synthesis, and the cholesterol that is essential for remyelination has to originate from other cellular sources. Here, we show that repair following acute versus chronic demyelination involves distinct processes. In particular, in chronic myelin disease, when recycling of lipids is often defective, de novo neuronal cholesterol synthesis is critical for regeneration. By gene expression profiling, genetic loss-of-function experiments, and comprehensive phenotyping, we provide evidence that neurons increase cholesterol synthesis in chronic myelin disease models and in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). In mouse models, neuronal cholesterol facilitates remyelination specifically by triggering oligodendrocyte precursor cell proliferation. Our data contribute to the understanding of disease progression and have implications for therapeutic strategies in patients with MS.

34688664	Mitochondria are important organelles in eukaryotes. Turnover and quality control of mitochondria are regulated at the transcriptional and posttranslational level by several cellular mechanisms. Removal of defective mitochondrial proteins is mediated by mitochondria resident proteases or by proteasomal degradation of individual proteins. Clearance of bulk mitochondria occurs via a selective form of autophagy termed mitophagy. In yeast and some developing metazoan cells (e.g., oocytes and reticulocytes), mitochondria are largely removed by ubiquitin-independent mechanisms. In such cases, the regulation of mitophagy is mediated via phosphorylation of mitochondria-anchored autophagy receptors. On the other hand, ubiquitin-dependent recruitment of cytosolic autophagy receptors occurs in situations of cellular stress or disease, where dysfunctional mitochondria would cause oxidative damage. In mammalian cells, a well-studied ubiquitin-dependent mitophagy pathway induced by mitochondrial depolarization is regulated by the mitochondrial protein kinase PINK1, which upon activation recruits the ubiquitin ligase parkin. Here, we review mechanisms of mitophagy with an emphasis on posttranslational modifications that regulate various mitophagy pathways. We describe the autophagy components involved with particular emphasis on posttranslational modifications. We detail the phosphorylations mediated by PINK1 and parkin-mediated ubiquitylations of mitochondrial proteins that can be modulated by deubiquitylating enzymes. We also discuss the role of accessory factors regulating mitochondrial fission/fusion and the interplay with pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Comprehensive knowledge of the processes of mitophagy is essential for the understanding of vital mitochondrial turnover in health and disease.

34986356	Synaptic plasticity is long-lasting changes in synaptic currents and structure. When neurons are exposed to signals that induce aberrant neuronal excitation, they increase the threshold for the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), known as metaplasticity. However, the metaplastic regulation of structural LTP (sLTP) remains unclear. We investigate glutamate uncaging/photoactivatable (pa)CaMKII-dependent sLTP induction in hippocampal CA1 neurons after chronic neuronal excitation by GABAA receptor antagonists. We find that the neuronal excitation decreases the glutamate uncaging-evoked Ca(2+) influx mediated by GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors and suppresses sLTP induction. In addition, single-spine optogenetic stimulation using paCaMKII indicates the suppression of CaMKII signaling. While the inhibition of Ca(2+) influx is protein synthesis independent, the paCaMKII-induced sLTP suppression depends on it. Our findings demonstrate that chronic neuronal excitation suppresses sLTP in two independent ways (i.e., dual inhibition of Ca(2+) influx and CaMKII signaling). This dual inhibition mechanism may contribute to robust neuronal protection in excitable environments.	Chronic neuronal excitation leads to dual metaplasticity in the signaling for structural long-term potentiation.	Cell reports	0.0	0

34469729	Tubo-ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is unresponsive to immune checkpoint blockade despite significant frequencies of exhausted T cells. Here we apply mass cytometry and uncover decidual-like natural killer (dl-NK) cell subpopulations (CD56+CD9+CXCR3+KIR+CD3-CD16-) in newly diagnosed HGSC samples that correlate with both tumor and transitioning epithelial-mesenchymal cell abundance. We show different combinatorial expression patterns of ligands for activating and inhibitory NK receptors within three HGSC tumor compartments: epithelial (E), transitioning epithelial-mesenchymal (EV), and mesenchymal (vimentin expressing [V]), with a more inhibitory ligand phenotype in V cells. In cocultures, NK-92 natural killer cells acquire CD9 from HGSC tumor cells by trogocytosis, resulting in reduced anti-tumor cytokine production and cytotoxicity. Cytotoxicity in these cocultures is restored with a CD9-blocking antibody or CD9 CRISPR knockout, thereby identifying mechanisms of immune suppression in HGSC. CD9 is widely expressed in HGSC tumors and so represents an important new therapeutic target with immediate relevance for NK immunotherapy.

34876684	Simultaneous imaging of various facets of intact biological systems across multiple spatiotemporal scales is a long-standing goal in biology and medicine, for which progress is hindered by limits of conventional imaging modalities. Here we propose using the refractive index (RI), an intrinsic quantity governing light-matter interaction, as a means for such measurement. We show that major endogenous subcellular structures, which are conventionally accessed via exogenous fluorescence labelling, are encoded in three-dimensional (3D) RI tomograms. We decode this information in a data-driven manner, with a deep learning-based model that infers multiple 3D fluorescence tomograms from RI measurements of the corresponding subcellular targets, thereby achieving multiplexed microtomography. This approach, called RI2FL for refractive index to fluorescence, inherits the advantages of both high-specificity fluorescence imaging and label-free RI imaging. Importantly, full 3D modelling of absolute and unbiased RI improves generalization, such that the approach is applicable to a broad range of new samples without retraining to facilitate immediate applicability. The performance, reliability and scalability of this technology are extensively characterized, and its various applications within single-cell profiling at unprecedented scales (which can generate new experimentally testable hypotheses) are demonstrated.

34695418	Adipose-tissue-resident macrophages (ATMs) maintain metabolic homeostasis but also contribute to obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. Central to these contrasting effects of ATMs on metabolic homeostasis is the interaction of macrophages with fatty acids. Fatty acid levels are increased within adipose tissue in various pathological and physiological conditions, but appear to initiate inflammatory responses only upon interaction with particular macrophage subsets within obese adipose tissue. The molecular basis underlying these divergent outcomes is likely due to phenotypic differences between ATM subsets, although how macrophage polarization state influences the metabolism of exogenous fatty acids is relatively unknown. Herein, using stable isotope-labeled and nonlabeled fatty acids in combination with mass spectrometry lipidomics, we show marked differences in the utilization of exogenous fatty acids within inflammatory macrophages (M1 macrophages) and macrophages involved in tissue homeostasis (M2 macrophages). Specifically, the accumulation of exogenous fatty acids within triacylglycerols and cholesterol esters is significantly higher in M1 macrophages, while there is an increased enrichment of exogenous fatty acids within glycerophospholipids, ether lipids, and sphingolipids in M2 macrophages. Finally, we show that functionally distinct ATM populations in vivo have distinct lipid compositions. Collectively, this study identifies new aspects of the metabolic reprogramming that occur in distinct macrophage polarization states. The channeling of exogenous fatty acids into particular lipid synthetic pathways may contribute to the sensitivity/resistance of macrophage subsets to the inflammatory effects of increased environmental fatty acid levels.	Macrophage polarization state affects lipid composition and the channeling of exogenous fatty acids into endogenous lipid pools.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0.0	0
34469721	Germline development is sensitive to nutrient availability and environmental perturbation. Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), a key transcription factor driving the cellular heat shock response (HSR), is also involved in gametogenesis. The precise function of HSF1 (HSF-1 in C. elegans) and its regulation in germline development are poorly understood. Using the auxin-inducible degron system in C. elegans, we uncovered a role of HSF-1 in progenitor cell proliferation and early meiosis and identified a compact but important transcriptional program of HSF-1 in germline development. Interestingly, heat stress only induces the canonical HSR in a subset of germ cells but impairs HSF-1 binding at its developmental targets. Conversely, insulin/insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling dictates the requirement for HSF-1 in germline development and functions through repressing FOXO/DAF-16 in the soma to activate HSF-1 in germ cells. We propose that this non-cell-autonomous mechanism couples nutrient-sensing insulin/IGF-1 signaling to HSF-1 activation to support homeostasis in rapid germline growth.	Insulin/IGF-1 signaling and heat stress differentially regulate HSF1 activities in germline development.	Cell reports	2.0	0
34919962	Changing physiological conditions can increase the need for protein degradative capacity in eukaryotic cells. Both the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy contribute to protein degradation. However, these processes can be differently regulated depending on the physiological conditions. Strikingly, proteasomes themselves can be a substrate for autophagy. The signals and molecular mechanisms that govern proteasome autophagy (proteaphagy) are only partly understood. Here, we used immunoblots, native gel analyses, and fluorescent microscopy to understand the regulation of proteaphagy in response to genetic and small molecule-induced perturbations. Our data indicate that chemical inhibition of the master nutrient sensor TORC1 (inhibition of which induces general autophagy) with rapamycin induces a bi-phasic response where proteasome levels are upregulated after an autophagy-dependent reduction. Surprisingly, several conditions that result in inhibited TORC1, such as caffeinine treatment or nitrogen starvation, only induced proteaphagy (i.e., without any proteasome upregulation), suggesting a convergence of signals upstream of proteaphagy under different physiological conditions. Indeed, we found that several conditions that activated general autophagy did not induce proteaphagy, further distinguishing proteaphagy from general autophagy. Consistent with this, we show that Atg11, a selective autophagy receptor, as well as the MAP kinases Mpk1, Mkk1, and Mkk2 all play a role in autophagy of proteasomes, although they are dispensable for general autophagy. Taken together, our data provide new insights into the molecular regulation of proteaphagy by demonstrating that degradation of proteasome complexes is specifically regulated under different autophagy-inducing conditions.	Proteaphagy is specifically regulated and requires factors dispensable for general autophagy.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0.0	0
34965434	The lipid raft-resident protein, MAL2, has been implicated as contributing to the pathogenesis of several malignancies, including breast cancer, but the underlying mechanism for its effects on tumorigenesis is unknown. Here, we show that MAL2-mediated lipid raft formation leads to HER2 plasma membrane retention and enhanced HER2 signaling in breast cancer cells. We demonstrate physical interactions between HER2 and MAL2 in lipid rafts using proximity ligation assays. Super-resolution structured illumination microscopy imaging displays the structural organization of the HER2/Ezrin/NHERF1/PMCA2 protein complex. Formation of this protein complex maintains low intracellular calcium concentrations in the vicinity of the plasma membrane. HER2/MAL2 protein interactions in lipid rafts are enhanced in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells. Our findings suggest that MAL2 is crucial for lipid raft formation, HER2 signaling, and HER2 membrane stability in breast cancer cells, suggesting MAL2 as a potential therapeutic target.

34433060	Germline alterations of the NF2 gene cause neurofibromatosis type 2, a syndrome manifested with benign tumors, and Nf2 deletion in mice also results in slow tumorigenesis. As a regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway, NF2 induces LATS1/2 kinases and consequently represses YAP/TAZ. YAP/TAZ oncoproteins are also inhibited by motin family proteins (Motins). Here, we show that the Hippo signaling is fine-tuned by Motins in a NF2-dependent manner, in which NF2 recruits E3 ligase RNF146 to facilitate ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Motins. In the absence of NF2, Motins robustly accumulate to restrict full activation of YAP/TAZ and prevent rapid tumorigenesis. Hence, NF2 deficiency not only activates YAP/TAZ by inhibiting LATS1/2 but also stabilizes Motins to keep YAP/TAZ activity in check. The upregulation of Motins upon NF2 deletion serves as a strategy for avoiding uncontrolled perturbation of the Hippo signaling and may contribute to the benign nature of most NF2-mutated tumors.	Stabilization of Motin family proteins in NF2-deficient cells prevents full activation of YAP/TAZ and rapid tumorigenesis.	Cell reports	3.0	1
34644578	Uncovering vulnerable steps in the life cycle of viruses supports the rational design of antiviral treatments. However, information on viral replication dynamics obtained from traditional bulk assays with host cell populations is inherently limited as the data represent averages over a multitude of unsynchronized replication cycles. Here, we use time-lapse imaging of virus replication in thousands of single cells, combined with computational inference, to identify rate-limiting steps for dengue virus (DENV), a widespread human pathogen. Comparing wild-type DENV with a vaccine candidate mutant, we show that the viral spread in the mutant is greatly attenuated by delayed onset of productive replication, whereas wild-type and mutant virus have identical replication rates. Single-cell analysis done after applying the broad-spectrum antiviral drug, ribavirin, at clinically relevant concentrations revealed the same mechanism of attenuating viral spread. We conclude that the initial steps of infection, rather than the rate of established replication, are quantitatively limiting DENV spread.	Dengue virus is sensitive to inhibition prior to productive replication.	Cell reports	0.0	0
34910914	Activation of the pro-degenerative protein SARM1 after diverse physical and disease-relevant injuries causes programmed axon degeneration. Original studies indicate that substantially decreased SARM1 levels are required for neuroprotection. However, we demonstrate, in Sarm1 haploinsufficient mice, that lowering SARM1 levels by 50% delays programmed axon degeneration in vivo after sciatic nerve transection and partially prevents neurite outgrowth defects in mice lacking the pro-survival factor NMNAT2. In vitro, the rate of degeneration in response to traumatic, neurotoxic, and genetic triggers of SARM1 activation is also slowed. Finally, we demonstrate that Sarm1 antisense oligonucleotides decrease SARM1 levels by more than 50% in vitro, which delays or prevents programmed axon degeneration. Combining Sarm1 haploinsufficiency with antisense oligonucleotides further decreases SARM1 levels and prolongs protection after neurotoxic injury. These data demonstrate that axon protection occurs in a Sarm1 gene dose-responsive manner and that SARM1-lowering agents have therapeutic potential, making Sarm1-targeting antisense oligonucleotides a promising therapeutic strategy.

34965423	Ran's GTPase-activating protein (RanGAP) is tethered to the nuclear envelope (NE) in multicellular organisms. We investigated the consequences of RanGAP localization in human tissue culture cells and Drosophila. In tissue culture cells, disruption of RanGAP1 NE localization surprisingly has neither obvious impacts on viability nor nucleocytoplasmic transport of a model substrate. In Drosophila, we identified a region within nucleoporin dmRanBP2 required for direct tethering of dmRanGAP to the NE. A dmRanBP2 mutant lacking this region shows no apparent growth defects during larval stages but arrests at the early pupal stage. A direct fusion of dmRanGAP to the dmRanBP2 mutant rescues this arrest, indicating that dmRanGAP recruitment to dmRanBP2 per se is necessary for the pupal ecdysis sequence. Our results indicate that while the NE localization of RanGAP is widely conserved in multicellular organisms, the targeting mechanisms are not. Further, we find a requirement for this localization during pupal development.	Association of RanGAP to nuclear pore complex component, RanBP2/Nup358, is required for pupal development in Drosophila.

35021101	Nanoparticle (NP) vaccine formulations promote immune responses through multiple mechanisms. We recently reported that mannose-binding lectin (MBL) triggers trafficking of glycosylated HIV Env-immunogen NPs to lymph node follicles. Here, we investigate effects of MBL and complement on NP forms of HIV and other viral antigens. MBL recognition of oligomannose on gp120 nanoparticles significantly increases antigen accumulation in lymph nodes and antigen-specific germinal center (GC) responses. MBL and complement also mediate follicular trafficking and enhance GC responses to influenza, HBV, and HPV particulate antigens. Using model protein nanoparticles bearing titrated levels of glycosylation, we determine that mannose patches at a minimal density of 2.1 x 10(-3) mannose patches/nm(2) are required to trigger follicular targeting, which increases with increasing glycan density up to at least approximately 8.2 x 10(-3) patches/nm(2). Thus, innate immune recognition of glycans has a significant impact on humoral immunity, and these findings provide a framework for engineering glycan recognition to optimize vaccine efficacy.

34537242	As a conserved posttranslational modification, SUMOylation has been shown to play important roles in chromatin-related biological processes including transcription. However, how the SUMOylation machinery associates with chromatin is not clear. Here, we present evidence that multiple SUMOylation machinery components, including SUMO E1 proteins SAE1 and SAE2 and the PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) family SUMO E3 ligases, are primarily associated with the nuclear matrix rather than with chromatin. We show using nuclease digestion that all PIAS family proteins maintain nuclear matrix association in the absence of chromatin. Of importance, we identify multiple histones including H3 and H2A.Z as directly interacting with PIAS1 and demonstrate that this interaction requires the PIAS1 SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS) domain. We demonstrate that PIAS1 promotes SUMOylation of histones H3 and H2B in both a SAP domain- and an E3 ligase activity-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that PIAS1 binds to heat shock-induced genes and represses their expression and that this function also requires the SAP domain. Altogether, our study reveals for the first time the nuclear matrix as the compartment most enriched in SUMO E1 and PIAS family E3 ligases. Our finding that PIAS1 interacts directly with histone proteins also suggests a molecular mechanism as to how nuclear matrix-associated PIAS1 is able to regulate transcription and other chromatin-related processes.

35021091	Plants respond to higher temperatures by the action of heat stress (HS) transcription factors (Hsfs), which control the onset, early response, and long-term acclimation to HS. Members of the HsfA1 subfamily, such as tomato HsfA1a, are the central regulators of HS response, and their activity is fine-tuned by other Hsfs. We identify tomato HsfA7 as capacitor of HsfA1a during the early HS response. Upon a mild temperature increase, HsfA7 is induced in an HsfA1a-dependent manner. The subsequent interaction of the two Hsfs prevents the stabilization of HsfA1a resulting in a negative feedback mechanism. Under prolonged or severe HS, HsfA1a and HsfA7 complexes stimulate the induction of genes required for thermotolerance. Therefore, HsfA7 exhibits a co-repressor mode at mild HS by regulating HsfA1a abundance to moderate the upregulation of HS-responsive genes. HsfA7 undergoes a temperature-dependent transition toward a co-activator of HsfA1a to enhance the acquired thermotolerance capacity of tomato plants.	HsfA7 coordinates the transition from mild to strong heat stress response by controlling the activity of the master regulator HsfA1a in tomato.	Cell reports	2.5	1
34800435	Phthalate, a plasticizer, endocrine disruptor, and potential carcinogen, is degraded by a variety of bacteria. This degradation is initiated by phthalate dioxygenase (PDO), a Rieske oxygenase (RO) that catalyzes the dihydroxylation of phthalate to a dihydrodiol. PDO has long served as a model for understanding ROs despite a lack of structural data. Here we purified PDOKF1 from Comamonas testosteroni KF1 and found that it had an apparent kcat/Km for phthalate of 0.58 +/- 0.09 muM(-1)s(-1), over 25-fold greater than for terephthalate. The crystal structure of the enzyme at 2.1 A resolution revealed that it is a hexamer comprising two stacked alpha3 trimers, a configuration not previously observed in RO crystal structures. We show that within each trimer, the protomers adopt a head-to-tail configuration typical of ROs. The stacking of the trimers is stabilized by two extended helices, which make the catalytic domain of PDOKF1 larger than that of other characterized ROs. Complexes of PDOKF1 with phthalate and terephthalate revealed that Arg207 and Arg244, two residues on one face of the active site, position these substrates for regiospecific hydroxylation. Consistent with their roles as determinants of substrate specificity, substitution of either residue with alanine yielded variants that did not detectably turnover phthalate. Together, these results provide critical insights into a pollutant-degrading enzyme that has served as a paradigm for ROs and facilitate the engineering of this enzyme for bioremediation and biocatalytic applications.

35041463	G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that couple to the Galphai family of G proteins are key regulators of cell and tissue physiology. Our previous work has revealed new roles for Galphai in regulating the migration of neutrophils and fibrosarcoma cells downstream of activated chemoattractant receptors. Here, we used an intact cell proximity-based labeling coupled to tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics analysis to identify proteins that selectively interacted with the GTP-bound form of Galphai1. Multiple targets were identified and validated with a BioID2-tagged, constitutively active Galphai1 mutant, suggesting a network of interactions for activated GalphaI proteins in intact cells. We showed that active Galphai1, but not Galphai2, stimulated one candidate protein, PDZ-RhoGEF (PRG), despite more than 85% sequence identity between the G proteins. We also demonstrated in primary human neutrophils that active Galphai likely regulated the polarization of phosphorylated myosin light chain, a process critical for migration, through the activation of PRG. The identification and characterization of new targets directly or indirectly regulated by Galphai will aid in the investigation of the functional roles of Galphai-coupled GPCRs in multiple biological processes.

34525350	Assessing drug response within live native tissue provides increased fidelity with regards to optimizing efficacy while minimizing off-target effects. Here, using longitudinal intravital imaging of a Rac1-Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor mouse coupled with in vivo photoswitching to track intratumoral movement, we help guide treatment scheduling in a live breast cancer setting to impair metastatic progression. We uncover altered Rac1 activity at the center versus invasive border of tumors and demonstrate enhanced Rac1 activity of cells in close proximity to live tumor vasculature using optical window imaging. We further reveal that Rac1 inhibition can enhance tumor cell vulnerability to fluid-flow-induced shear stress and therefore improves overall anti-metastatic response to therapy during transit to secondary sites such as the lung. Collectively, this study demonstrates the utility of single-cell intravital imaging in vivo to demonstrate that Rac1 inhibition can reduce tumor progression and metastases in an autochthonous setting to improve overall survival.

34425107	The stability of a protein is regulated by a balance between its ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation. S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) is an oncogenic F-box protein that recognizes tumor suppressor substrates for targeted ubiquitylation by the E3 ligase SKP1-Cullin1-F-box and degradation by proteasome. SKP2 is itself ubiquitylated by the E3 ligases APC/C(CDH1) and SCF(FBXW2), and deubiquitylated by deubiquitylases (DUBs) USP10 and USP13. Given the biological significance of SKP2, it is likely that the other E3s or DUBs may also regulate its stability. Here, we report the identification and characterization of USP2 as a new DUB. We first screened a panel of DUBs and found that both USP2 and USP21 bound to endogenous SKP2, but only USP2 deubiquitylated and stabilized SKP2 protein. USP2 inactivation via siRNA knockdown or small-molecule inhibitor treatment remarkably shortened SKP2 protein half-life by enhancing its ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation. Unexpectedly, USP2-stabilized SKP2 did not destabilize its substrates p21 and p27. Mechanistically, USP2 bound to SKP2 via the leucine-rich repeat substrate-binding domain on SKP2 to disrupt the SKP2-substrate binding, leading to stabilization of both SKP2 and these substrates. Biologically, growth suppression induced by USP2 knockdown or USP2 inhibitor is partially mediated via modulation of SKP2 and its substrates. Our study revealed a new mechanism of the cross-talk among the E3-DUB substrates and its potential implication in targeting the USP2-SKP2 axis for cancer therapy.

34826421	The catabolism of pectin from plant cell walls plays a crucial role in the virulence of the phytopathogen Dickeya dadantii. In particular, the timely expression of pel genes encoding major pectate lyases is essential to circumvent the plant defense systems and induce massive pectinolytic activity during the maceration phase. Previous studies identified the role of a positive feedback loop specific to the pectin-degradation pathway, whereas the precise signals controlling the dynamics of pectate lyase expression were unclear. Here, we show that the latter is controlled by a metabolic switch involving both glucose and pectin. We measured the HPLC concentration profiles of the key metabolites related to these two sources of carbon, cAMP and 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate, and developed a dynamic and quantitative model of the process integrating the associated regulators, cAMP receptor protein and KdgR. The model describes the regulatory events occurring at the promoters of two major pel genes, pelE and pelD. It highlights that their activity is controlled by a mechanism of carbon catabolite repression, which directly controls the virulence of D. dadantii. The model also shows that quantitative differences in the binding properties of common regulators at these two promoters resulted in a qualitatively different role of pelD and pelE in the metabolic switch, and also likely in conditions of infection, justifying their evolutionary conservation as separate genes in this species.

34762908	ER-to-Golgi transport is the first step in the constitutive secretory pathway, which, unlike regulated secretion, is believed to proceed nonstop independent of Ca(2+) flux. However, here we demonstrate that penta-EF hand (PEF) proteins ALG-2 and peflin constitute a hetero-bifunctional COPII regulator that responds to Ca(2+) signaling by adopting one of several distinct activity states. Functionally, these states can adjust the rate of ER export of COPII-sorted cargos up or down by approximately 50%. We found that at steady-state Ca(2+), ALG-2/peflin hetero-complexes bind to ER exit sites (ERES) through the ALG-2 subunit to confer a low, buffered secretion rate, while peflin-lacking ALG-2 complexes markedly stimulate secretion. Upon Ca(2+) signaling, ALG-2 complexes lacking peflin can either increase or decrease the secretion rate depending on signaling intensity and duration-phenomena that could contribute to cellular growth and intercellular communication following secretory increases or protection from excitotoxicity and infection following decreases. In epithelial normal rat kidney (NRK) cells, the Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonist ATP causes ALG-2 to depress ER export, while in neuroendocrine PC12 cells, Ca(2+) mobilization by ATP results in ALG-2-dependent enhancement of secretion. Furthermore, distinct Ca(2+) signaling patterns in NRK cells produce opposing ALG-2-dependent effects on secretion. Mechanistically, ALG-2-dependent depression of secretion involves decreased levels of the COPII outer shell and increased peflin targeting to ERES, while ALG-2-dependent enhancement of secretion involves increased COPII outer shell and decreased peflin at ERES. These data provide insights into how PEF protein dynamics affect secretion of important physiological cargoes such as collagen I and significantly impact ER stress.

34717955	Detection of thymidine analogues after their incorporation into replicating DNA represents a powerful tool for the study of cellular DNA synthesis, progression through the cell cycle, cell proliferation kinetics, chronology of cell division, and cell fate determination. Recent advances in the concurrent detection of multiple such analogues offer new avenues for the investigation of unknown features of these vital cellular processes. Combined with quantitative analysis, temporal discrimination of multiple labels enables elucidation of various aspects of stem cell life cycle in situ, such as division modes, differentiation, maintenance, and elimination. Data obtained from such experiments are critically important for creating descriptive models of tissue histogenesis and renewal in embryonic development and adult life. Despite the wide use of thymidine analogues in stem cell research, there are a number of caveats to consider for obtaining valid and reliable labeling results when marking replicating DNA with nucleotide analogues. Therefore, in this review, we describe critical points regarding dosage, delivery, and detection of nucleotide analogues in the context of single and multiple labeling, outline labeling schemes based on pulse-chase, cumulative and multilabel marking of replicating DNA for revealing stem cell proliferative behaviors, and determining cell cycle parameters, and discuss preconditions and pitfalls in conducting such experiments. The information presented in our review is important for rational design of experiments on tracking dividing stem cells by marking replicating DNA with thymidine analogues.

34585824	beta-Catenin is a multifunctional protein and participates in numerous processes required for embryonic development, cell proliferation, and homeostasis through various molecular interactions and signaling pathways. To date, however, there is no direct evidence that beta-catenin contributes to cytokinesis. Here, we identify a novel p-S60 epitope on beta-catenin generated by Plk1 kinase activity, which can be found at the actomyosin contractile ring of early telophase cells and at the midbody of late telophase cells. Depletion of beta-catenin leads to cytokinesis-defective phenotypes, which eventually result in apoptotic cell death. In addition, phosphorylation of beta-catenin Ser60 by Plk1 is essential for the recruitment of Ect2 to the midbody, activation of RhoA, and interaction between beta-catenin, Plk1, and Ect2. Time-lapse image analysis confirmed the importance of beta-catenin phospho-Ser60 in furrow ingression and the completion of cytokinesis. Taken together, we propose that phosphorylation of beta-catenin Ser60 by Plk1 in cooperation with Ect2 is essential for the completion of cytokinesis. These findings may provide fundamental knowledge for the research of cytokinesis failure-derived human diseases.

34525363	Heart rate has natural fluctuations that are typically ascribed to autonomic function. Recent evidence suggests that conscious processing can affect the timing of the heartbeat. We hypothesized that heart rate is modulated by conscious processing and therefore dependent on attentional focus. To test this, we leverage the observation that neural processes synchronize between subjects by presenting an identical narrative stimulus. As predicted, we find significant inter-subject correlation of heart rate (ISC-HR) when subjects are presented with an auditory or audiovisual narrative. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that ISC-HR is reduced when subjects are distracted from the narrative, and higher ISC-HR predicts better recall of the narrative. Finally, patients with disorders of consciousness have lower ISC-HR, as compared to healthy individuals. We conclude that heart rate fluctuations are partially driven by conscious processing, depend on attentional state, and may represent a simple metric to assess conscious state in unresponsive patients.	Conscious processing of narrative stimuli synchronizes heart rate between individuals.	Cell reports	0.0	0
34496251	The principles guiding the diurnal organization of biological pathways remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we perturb the hepatic transcriptome through nutrient regulators (high-fat diet and mTOR signaling components) to identify enduring properties of pathway organization. Temporal separation and counter-regulation between pathways of energy metabolism and inflammation/proliferation emerge as persistent transcriptome features across animal models, and network analysis identifies the G0s2 and Rgs16 genes as potential mediators at the metabolism-inflammation interface. Mechanistically, G0s2 and Rgs16 are sequentially induced during the light phase, promoting amino acid oxidation and suppressing overall mitochondrial respiration. In their absence, sphingolipids and diacylglycerides accumulate, accompanied by hepatic inflammation and hepatocyte proliferation. Notably, the expression of G0s2 and Rgs16 is further induced in obese mouse livers, and silencing of their expression accentuates hepatic fibrosis. Therefore, diurnal regulation of energy metabolism alleviates inflammatory and proliferative stresses under physiological and pathological conditions.

34932374	The control of T cell survival is crucial for defense against infectious pathogens or emerging cancers. Although the survival of peripheral naive T cells has been proposed to be controlled by interleukin-7 (IL-7) signaling and T cell receptor (TCR) activation by peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complexes (pMHC), the essential roles for these pathways in thymic output and T cell proliferation have complicated the analysis of their contributions to T cell survival. Here, we showed that the WD repeat-containing protein coronin 1, which is dispensable for thymic selection and output, promoted naive T cell survival in the periphery in a manner that was independent of TCR and IL-7 signaling. Coronin 1 was required for the maintenance of the basal activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kdelta), thereby suppressing caspase 8-mediated apoptosis. These results therefore reveal a coronin 1-dependent PI3Kdelta pathway that is independent of pMHC:TCR and IL-7 signaling and essential for peripheral T cell survival.

34739034	The pathways of membrane traffic within the Golgi apparatus are not fully known. This question was addressed using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which the maturation of individual Golgi cisternae can be visualized. We recently proposed that the AP-1 clathrin adaptor mediates intra-Golgi recycling late in the process of cisternal maturation. Here, we demonstrate that AP-1 cooperates with the Ent5 clathrin adaptor to recycle a set of Golgi transmembrane proteins, including some that were previously thought to pass through endosomes. This recycling can be detected by removing AP-1 and Ent5, thereby diverting the AP-1/Ent5-dependent Golgi proteins into an alternative recycling loop that involves traffic to the plasma membrane followed by endocytosis. Unexpectedly, various AP-1/Ent5-dependent Golgi proteins show either intermediate or late kinetics of residence in maturing cisternae. We infer that the AP-1/Ent5 pair mediates two sequential intra-Golgi recycling pathways that define two classes of Golgi proteins. This insight can explain the polarized distribution of transmembrane proteins in the Golgi.	Clathrin adaptors mediate two sequential pathways of intra-Golgi recycling.

34416234	All extant life forms require trace transition metals (e.g., Fe(2/3+), Cu(1/2+), and Mn(2+)) to survive. However, as these are environmentally scarce, organisms have evolved sophisticated metal uptake machineries. In bacteria, high-affinity import of transition metals is predominantly mediated by ABC transporters. During bacterial infection, sequestration of metal by the host further limits the availability of these ions, and accordingly, bacterial ABC transporters (importers) of metals are key virulence determinants. However, the structure-function relationships of these metal transporters have not been fully elucidated. Here, we used metal-sensitivity assays, advanced structural modeling, and enzymatic assays to study the ABC transporter MntBC-A, a virulence determinant of the bacterial human pathogen Bacillus anthracis. We find that despite its broad metal-recognition profile, MntBC-A imports only manganese, whereas zinc can function as a high-affinity inhibitor of MntBC-A. Computational analysis shows that the transmembrane metal permeation pathway is lined with six titratable residues that can coordinate the positively charged metal, and mutagenesis studies show that they are essential for manganese transport. Modeling suggests that access to these titratable residues is blocked by a ladder of hydrophobic residues, and ATP-driven conformational changes open and close this hydrophobic seal to permit metal binding and release. The conservation of this arrangement of titratable and hydrophobic residues among ABC transporters of transition metals suggests a common mechanism. These findings advance our understanding of transmembrane metal recognition and permeation and may aid the design and development of novel antibacterial agents.

34958800	Pharmacological inhibition of protein kinases induces adaptive reprogramming of tumor cell regulatory networks by altering expression of genes that regulate signaling, including protein kinases. Adaptive responses are dependent on transcriptional changes resulting from remodeling of enhancer and promoter landscapes. Enhancer and promoter remodeling in response to targeted kinase inhibition is controlled by changes in open chromatin state and by activity of specific transcription factors, such as c-MYC. This review focuses on the dynamic plasticity of protein kinase expression of the tumor cell kinome and the resulting adaptive resistance to targeted kinase inhibition. Plasticity of the functional kinome has been shown in patient window trials where triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer patient tumors were characterized by RNAseq after biopsies before and after 1 week of therapy. The expressed kinome changed dramatically during drug treatment, and these changes in kinase expression were shown in cell lines and xenografts in mice to be correlated with adaptive tumor cell drug resistance. The dynamic transcriptional nature of the kinome also differs for inhibitors targeting different kinase signaling pathways (e.g., BRAF-MEK-ERK versus PI3K-AKT) that are commonly activated in cancers. Heterogeneity arising from differences in gene regulation and mutations represents a challenge to therapeutic durability and prevention of clinical drug resistance with drug-tolerant tumor cell populations developing and persisting through treatment. We conclude that understanding the heterogeneity of kinase expression at baseline and in response to therapy is imperative for development of combinations and timing intervals of therapies making interventions durable.

34437902	There are five known general catalytic mechanisms used by enzymes to catalyze carbohydrate epimerization. The amino sugar epimerase N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate 2-epimerase (NanE) has been proposed to use a deprotonation-reprotonation mechanism, with an essential catalytic lysine required for both steps. However, the structural determinants of this mechanism are not clearly established. We characterized NanE from Staphylococcus aureus using a new coupled assay to monitor NanE catalysis in real time and found that it has kinetic constants comparable with other species. The crystal structure of NanE from Staphylococcus aureus, which comprises a triosephosphate isomerase barrel fold with an unusual dimeric architecture, was solved with both natural and modified substrates. Using these substrate-bound structures, we identified the following active-site residues lining the cleft at the C-terminal end of the beta-strands: Gln11, Arg40, Lys63, Asp124, Glu180, and Arg208, which were individually substituted and assessed in relation to the mechanism. From this, we re-evaluated the central role of Glu180 in this mechanism alongside the catalytic lysine. We observed that the substrate is bound in a conformation that ideally positions the C5 hydroxyl group to be activated by Glu180 and donate a proton to the C2 carbon. Taken together, we propose that NanE uses a novel substrate-assisted proton displacement mechanism to invert the C2 stereocenter of N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate. Our data and mechanistic interpretation may be useful in the development of inhibitors of this enzyme or in enzyme engineering to produce biocatalysts capable of changing the stereochemistry of molecules that are not amenable to synthetic methods.

35021089	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells rely on phospho-signaling pathways to gain unlimited proliferation potential. Here, we use domain-focused CRISPR screening and identify the nuclear phosphatase SCP4 as a dependency in AML, yet this enzyme is dispensable in normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. Using CRISPR exon scanning and gene complementation assays, we show that the catalytic function of SCP4 is essential in AML. Through mass spectrometry analysis of affinity-purified complexes, we identify the kinase paralogs STK35 and PDIK1L as binding partners and substrates of the SCP4 phosphatase domain. We show that STK35 and PDIK1L function catalytically and redundantly in the same pathway as SCP4 to maintain AML proliferation and to support amino acid biosynthesis and transport. We provide evidence that SCP4 regulates STK35/PDIK1L through two distinct mechanisms: catalytic removal of inhibitory phosphorylation and by promoting kinase stability. Our findings reveal a phosphatase-kinase signaling complex that supports the pathogenesis of AML.	SCP4-STK35/PDIK1L complex is a dual phospho-catalytic signaling dependency in acute myeloid leukemia.

34644577	DNA damage reshapes the cellular transcriptome by modulating RNA transcription and processing. In cancer cells, these changes can alter the expression of genes in the immune surveillance and cell death pathways. Here, we investigate how DNA damage impacts alternative polyadenylation (APA) using the PAPERCLIP technique. We find that APA shifts are a coordinated response for hundreds of genes to DNA damage, and we identify PCF11 as an important contributor of DNA damage-induced APA shifts. One of these APA shifts results in upregulation of the full-length MSL1 mRNA isoform, which protects cells from DNA damage-induced apoptosis and promotes cell survival from DNA-damaging agents. Importantly, blocking MSL1 upregulation enhances cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents even in the absence of p53 and overcomes chemoresistance. Our study demonstrates that characterizing adaptive APA shifts to DNA damage has therapeutic implications and reveals a link between PCF11, the MSL complex, and DNA damage-induced apoptosis.

34469727	Somatic mutations in spliceosome genes are found in approximately 50% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a myeloid malignancy associated with low blood counts. Expression of the mutant splicing factor U2AF1(S34F) alters hematopoiesis and mRNA splicing in mice. Our understanding of the functionally relevant alternatively spliced target genes that cause hematopoietic phenotypes in vivo remains incomplete. Here, we demonstrate that reduced expression of H2afy1.1, an alternatively spliced isoform of the histone H2A variant gene H2afy, is responsible for reduced B cells in U2AF1(S34F) mice. Deletion of H2afy or expression of U2AF1(S34F) reduces expression of Ebf1 (early B cell factor 1), a key transcription factor for B cell development, and mechanistically, H2AFY is enriched at the EBF1 promoter. Induced expression of H2AFY1.1 in U2AF1(S34F) cells rescues reduced EBF1 expression and B cells numbers in vivo. Collectively, our data implicate alternative splicing of H2AFY as a contributor to lymphopenia induced by U2AF1(S34F) in mice and MDS.

34896392	Aptamers are oligonucleotides selected from large pools of random sequences based on their affinity for bioactive molecules and are used in similar ways to antibodies. Aptamers provide several advantages over antibodies, including their small size, facile, large-scale chemical synthesis, high stability, and low immunogenicity. Amyloidogenic proteins, whose aggregation is relevant to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and prion diseases, are among the most challenging targets for aptamer development due to their conformational instability and heterogeneity, the same characteristics that make drug development against amyloidogenic proteins difficult. Recently, chemical tethering of aptagens (equivalent to antigens) and advances in high-throughput sequencing-based analysis have been used to overcome some of these challenges. In addition, internalization technologies using fusion to cellular receptors and extracellular vesicles have facilitated central nervous system (CNS) aptamer delivery. In view of the development of these techniques and resources, here we review antiamyloid aptamers, highlighting preclinical application to CNS therapy.

34951965	The hexameric Cdc48 ATPase (p97 or VCP in mammals) cooperates with its cofactor Ufd1/Npl4 to extract polyubiquitinated proteins from membranes or macromolecular complexes for degradation by the proteasome. Here, we clarify how the Cdc48 complex unfolds its substrates and translocates polypeptides with branchpoints. The Cdc48 complex recognizes primarily polyubiquitin chains rather than the attached substrate. Cdc48 and Ufd1/Npl4 cooperatively bind the polyubiquitin chain, resulting in the unfolding of one ubiquitin molecule (initiator). Next, the ATPase pulls on the initiator ubiquitin and moves all ubiquitin molecules linked to its C terminus through the central pore of the hexameric double ring, causing transient ubiquitin unfolding. When the ATPase reaches the isopeptide bond of the substrate, it can translocate and unfold both N- and C-terminal segments. Ubiquitins linked to the branchpoint of the initiator dissociate from Ufd1/Npl4 and move outside the central pore, resulting in the release of unfolded, polyubiquitinated substrate from Cdc48.

34973332	Heme oxygenases (HOs) detoxify heme by oxidatively degrading it into carbon monoxide, iron, and biliverdin, which is reduced to bilirubin and excreted. Humans express two isoforms of HO: the inducible HO-1, which is upregulated in response to excess heme and other stressors, and the constitutive HO-2. Much is known about the regulation and physiological function of HO-1, whereas comparatively little is known about the role of HO-2 in regulating heme homeostasis. The biochemical necessity for expressing constitutive HO-2 is dependent on whether heme is sufficiently abundant and accessible as a substrate under conditions in which HO-1 is not induced. By measuring labile heme, total heme, and bilirubin in human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells with silenced or overexpressed HO-2, as well as various HO-2 mutant alleles, we found that endogenous heme is too limiting a substrate to observe HO-2-dependent heme degradation. Rather, we discovered a novel role for HO-2 in the binding and buffering of heme. Taken together, in the absence of excess heme, we propose that HO-2 regulates heme homeostasis by acting as a heme buffering factor that controls heme bioavailability. When heme is in excess, HO-1 is induced, and both HO-2 and HO-1 can provide protection from heme toxicity via enzymatic degradation. Our results explain why catalytically inactive mutants of HO-2 are cytoprotective against oxidative stress. Moreover, the change in bioavailable heme due to HO-2 overexpression, which selectively binds ferric over ferrous heme, is consistent with labile heme being oxidized, thereby providing new insights into heme trafficking and signaling.

34587475	Apoptosis is a programmed cell death that efficiently removes damaged cells to maintain tissue homeostasis. Defect in apoptotic machinery can lead to tumor development, progression, and resistance to chemotherapy. PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis) and BAX (BCL2-associated X protein) are among the most well-known inducers of apoptosis. It has been reported that expression levels of BAX and PUMA are controlled at the posttranslational level by phosphorylation. However, the posttranslational regulation of these proapoptotic proteins remains largely unexplored. In this study, using biochemical, molecular biology, flow cytometric, and immunohistochemistry techniques, we show that PUMA and BAX are the direct target of the F-box protein FBXL20, which restricts their cellular levels. FBXL20 directs the proteasomal degradation of PUMA and BAX in a protein kinase AKT1-dependent manner to promote cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. Interestingly, inactivation of AKT1 results in activation of another protein kinase GSK3alpha/beta, which facilitates the proteasomal degradation of FBXL20 by another F-box protein, FBXO31. Thus, a switch between two signaling kinases AKT1 and GSK3alpha/beta modulates the functional activity of these proapoptotic regulators, thereby determining cell survival or death. RNAi-mediated ablation of FBXL20 results in increased levels of PUMA as well as BAX, which further enhances the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. We showed that high level expression of FBXL20 in cancer cells reduces therapeutic drug-induced apoptosis and promotes chemoresistance. Overall, this study highlights the importance of targeting FBXL20 in cancers in conjunction with chemotherapy and may represent a promising anticancer strategy to overcome chemoresistance.

34580996	Bacteria use a variety of mechanisms, such as two-component regulatory systems (TCSs), to rapidly sense and respond to distinct conditions and signals in their host organisms. For example, a type III secretion system (T3SS) is a key determinant of the virulence of the model plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae and contains the TCS RhpRS as a key regulator. However, the plant-derived compound targeting RhpRS remains unknown. Here, we report that RhpRS directly interacts with polyphenols and responds by switching off P. syringae T3SS via crosstalk with alternative histidine kinases. We identify three natural polyphenols that induce the expression of the rhpRS operon in an RhpS-dependent manner. The presence of these three specific polyphenols inhibits the phosphatase activity of RhpS, thus suppressing T3SS activation in T3SS-inducing conditions. The Pro40 residue of RhpS is essential to respond to these polyphenols. In addition, three non-cognate histidine kinases cooperatively phosphorylate RhpR and antagonize the rhpS mutant phenotype. This work illustrates that plant polyphenols can directly target P. syringae RhpRS, which results in bacterial virulence being switched off via a phosphorylation-related crosstalk.

34874453	Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are channels within the nuclear envelope that mediate nucleocytoplasmic transport. NPCs form within the closed nuclear envelope during interphase or assemble concomitantly with nuclear envelope reformation in late stages of mitosis. Both interphase and mitotic NPC biogenesis require coordination of protein complex assembly and membrane deformation. During early stages of mitotic NPC assembly, a seed for new NPCs is established on chromatin, yet the factors connecting the NPC seed to the membrane of the forming nuclear envelope are unknown. Here, we report that the reticulon homology domain protein REEP4 not only localizes to high-curvature membrane of the cytoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum but is also recruited to the inner nuclear membrane by the NPC biogenesis factor ELYS. This ELYS-recruited pool of REEP4 promotes NPC assembly and appears to be particularly important for NPC formation during mitosis. These findings suggest a role for REEP4 in coordinating nuclear envelope reformation with mitotic NPC biogenesis.

34433062	G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels are important for determining neuronal excitability. In addition to G proteins, GIRK channels are potentiated by membrane cholesterol, which is elevated in the brains of people with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's dementia and Parkinson's disease. The structural mechanism of cholesterol modulation of GIRK channels is not well understood. In this study, we present cryo- electron microscopy (cryoEM) structures of GIRK2 in the presence and absence of the cholesterol analog cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). The structures reveal that CHS binds near PIP2 in lipid-facing hydrophobic pockets of the transmembrane domain. Our structural analysis suggests that CHS stabilizes PIP2 interaction with the channel and promotes engagement of the cytoplasmic domain onto the transmembrane region. Mutagenesis of one of the CHS binding pockets eliminates cholesterol-dependent potentiation of GIRK2. Elucidating the structural mechanisms underlying cholesterol modulation of GIRK2 channels could facilitate the development of therapeutics for treating neurological diseases. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

34661602	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) carries out essential and conserved cellular functions, which depend on the maintenance of its structure and subcellular distribution. Here, we report developmentally regulated changes in ER morphology and composition during budding yeast meiosis, a conserved differentiation program that gives rise to gametes. A subset of the cortical ER collapses away from the plasma membrane at anaphase II, thus separating into a spatially distinct compartment. This programmed collapse depends on the transcription factor Ndt80, conserved ER membrane structuring proteins Lnp1 and reticulons, and the actin cytoskeleton. A subset of ER is retained at the mother cell plasma membrane and excluded from gamete cells via the action of ER-plasma membrane tethering proteins. ER remodeling is coupled to ER degradation by selective autophagy, which relies on ER collapse and is regulated by timed expression of the autophagy receptor Atg40. Thus, developmentally programmed changes in ER morphology determine the selective degradation or inheritance of ER subdomains by gametes.	Programmed cortical ER collapse drives selective ER degradation and inheritance in yeast meiosis.	The Journal of cell biology	0.0	0
34910840	Embryonic development is a complex process in which cells divide, migrate, and differentiate in a precise spatiotemporal pattern. Cell-cell communication among neighboring cells plays a central role in specifying cell fate and in coordinating development. Embryonic development also relies on physical interaction between cells and coordinated changes in cell shape. A more recently investigated phenomenon is the coupling of development of adjacent tissues via inter-tissue adhesion. In this issue of EMBO Reports, Monnot and colleagues identify a role for inter-tissue adhesion in the development of adjacent sensory organs in the zebrafish.

34433044	The liver plays central roles in coordinating different metabolic processes, such as the catabolism of amino acids. In this study, we identify a loss of tyrosine catabolism and a concomitant increase in serum tyrosine levels during liver cancer development. Liver cells with disordered tyrosine catabolism, as exemplified by the suppression of a tyrosine catabolic enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD), display augmented tumorigenic and proliferative potentials. Metabolomics profiling and isotope tracing reveal the metabolic reliance of HPD-silenced cells on glutamine, coupled with increased tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites and their associated amino acid pools. Mechanistically, HPD silencing reduces ketone bodies, which regulate the proliferative and metabolic phenotypes via the AMPK/mTOR/p70S6 kinase pathway and mTOR-dependent glutaminase (GLS) activation. Collectively, our results demonstrate a metabolic link between tyrosine and glutamine metabolism, which could be exploited as a potentially promising anticancer therapy for liver cancer.

34608266	The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been recognized as a driving force for tumor progression in breast cancer. Recently, our group identified the RNA Binding Motif Single Stranded Interacting Protein 3 (RBMS3) to be significantly associated with an EMT transcriptional program in breast cancer. Additional expression profiling demonstrated that RBMS3 was consistently upregulated by multiple EMT transcription factors and correlated with mesenchymal gene expression in breast cancer cell lines. Functionally, RBMS3 was sufficient to induce EMT in two immortalized mammary epithelial cell lines. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) models, RBMS3 was necessary for maintaining the mesenchymal phenotype and invasion and migration in vitro. Loss of RBMS3 significantly impaired both tumor progression and spontaneous metastasis in vivo. Using a genome-wide approach to interrogate mRNA stability, we found that ectopic expression of RBMS3 upregulates many genes that are resistant to degradation following transcriptional blockade by actinomycin D (ACTD). Specifically, RBMS3 was shown to interact with the mRNA of EMT transcription factor PRRX1 and promote PRRX1 mRNA stability. PRRX1 is required for RBMS3-mediated EMT and is partially sufficient to rescue the effect of RBMS3 knockdown in TNBC cell lines. Together, this study identifies RBMS3 as a novel and common effector of EMT, which could be a promising therapeutic target for TNBC treatment.

34473996	Nitroreductases are emerging as attractive bioremediation enzymes, with substrate promiscuity toward both natural and synthetic compounds. Recently, the nitroreductase NfnB from Sphingopyxis sp. strain HMH exhibited metabolic activity for dinitroaniline herbicides including butralin and pendimethalin, triggering the initial steps of their degradation and detoxification. However, the determinants of the specificity of NfnB for these herbicides are unknown. In this study, we performed structural and biochemical analyses of NfnB to decipher its substrate specificity. The homodimer NfnB is a member of the PnbA subgroup of the nitroreductase family. Each monomer displays a central alpha + beta fold for the core domain, with a protruding middle region and an extended C-terminal region. The protruding middle region of Val75-Tyr129 represents a structural extension that is a common feature to members of the PnbA subgroup and functions as an opening wall connecting the coenzyme FMN-binding site to the surface, therefore serving as a substrate binding site. We performed mutational, kinetic, and structural analyses of mutant enzymes and found that Tyr88 in the middle region plays a pivotal role in substrate specificity by determining the dimensions of the wall opening. The mutation of Tyr88 to phenylalanine or alanine caused significant changes in substrate selectivity toward bulkier dinitroaniline herbicides such as oryzalin and isopropalin without compromising its activity. These results provide a framework to modify the substrate specificity of nitroreductase in the PnbA subgroup, which has been a challenging issue for its biotechnological and bioremediation applications.

34818553	We report that atypical protein kinase Ciota (PKCiota) is an oncogenic driver of glioblastoma (GBM). Deletion or inhibition of PKCiota significantly impairs tumor growth and prolongs survival in murine GBM models. GBM cells expressing elevated PKCiota signaling are sensitive to PKCiota inhibitors, whereas those expressing low PKCiota signaling exhibit active SRC signaling and sensitivity to SRC inhibitors. Resistance to the PKCiota inhibitor auranofin is associated with activated SRC signaling and response to a SRC inhibitor, whereas resistance to a SRC inhibitor is associated with activated PKCiota signaling and sensitivity to auranofin. Interestingly, PKCiota- and SRC-dependent cells often co-exist in individual GBM tumors, and treatment of GBM-bearing mice with combined auranofin and SRC inhibitor prolongs survival beyond either drug alone. Thus, we identify PKCiota and SRC signaling as distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities that are directly translatable into an improved treatment for GBM.

34910920	Retinal bipolar cells are second-order neurons that transmit basic features of the visual scene to postsynaptic partners. However, their contribution to motion detection has not been fully appreciated. Here, we demonstrate that cholinergic feedback from starburst amacrine cells (SACs) to certain presynaptic bipolar cells via alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha7-nAChRs) promotes direction-selective signaling. Patch clamp recordings reveal that distinct bipolar cell types making synapses at proximal SAC dendrites also express alpha7-nAChRs, producing directionally skewed excitatory inputs. Asymmetric SAC excitation contributes to motion detection in On-Off direction-selective ganglion cells (On-Off DSGCs), predicted by computational modeling of SAC dendrites and supported by patch clamp recordings from On-Off DSGCs when bipolar cell alpha7-nAChRs is eliminated pharmacologically or by conditional knockout. Altogether, these results show that cholinergic feedback to bipolar cells enhances direction-selective signaling in postsynaptic SACs and DSGCs, illustrating how bipolar cells provide a scaffold for postsynaptic microcircuits to cooperatively enhance retinal motion detection.

34936871	The prostate gland produces prostatic fluid, high in zinc and citrate and essential for the maintenance of spermatozoa. Prostate cancer is a common condition with limited treatment efficacy in castration-resistant metastatic disease, including with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing to perform an unbiased assessment of the cellular landscape of human prostate, we identify a subset of tumor-enriched androgen receptor-negative luminal epithelial cells with increased expression of cancer-associated genes. We also find a variety of innate and adaptive immune cells in normal prostate that were transcriptionally perturbed in prostate cancer. An exception is a prostate-specific, zinc transporter-expressing macrophage population (MAC-MT) that contributes to tissue zinc accumulation in homeostasis but shows enhanced inflammatory gene expression in tumors, including T cell-recruiting chemokines. Remarkably, enrichment of the MAC-MT signature in cancer biopsies is associated with improved disease-free survival, suggesting beneficial antitumor functions.

34853466	Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most lethal gastrointestinal malignancies with high mortality. Recurrence develops within only a few years after curative resection and perioperative adjuvant therapy in 30-50% of these patients. Therefore, it is essential to identify postoperative recurrence biomarkers to facilitate selecting the following surveillance and therapeutic strategies. The general transcription factor IIE subunit beta (GTF2E2) is crucial for physiological and pathological functions, but its roles in the aggression and recurrence of ESCC remain ambiguous. In this study, we found that GTF2E2 was highly expressed in ESCC samples, and elevated GTF2E2 expression predicted early recurrence after surgery for ESCC patients. High expression of GTF2E2 associated with more aggressive clinic features and poor prognosis. GTF2E2 promoted the proliferation and mobility of ESCC cells in vitro and in vivo. We further revealed that miR-139-5p repressed GTF2E2 expression by downregulating its mRNA through binding with Argonaute 2 (Ago2). Rescue assays suggested that miR-139-5p affected GTF2E2-mediated ESCC progression. Moreover, GTF2E2 positively interacted with FUS promoter and regulated FUS expression, and the phenotype changes caused by GTF2E2 manipulation were recovered by rescuing FUS expression in ESCC cells. Additionally, we demonstrated that GTF2E2 promotes ESCC cells progression via activation of the AKT/ERK/mTOR pathway. In conclusion, GTF2E2 may serve as a novel biomarker for recurrence after surgery and a potential therapeutic target for ESCC patients, and it promotes ESCC progression via miR-139-5p/GTF2E2/FUS axis.

34936881	The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) initially protects broken DNA ends but then promotes their processing during non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Before ligation by NHEJ, DNA hairpin ends generated during V(D)J recombination must be opened by the Artemis nuclease, together with autophosphorylated DNA-PK. Structures of DNA-PK bound to DNA before and after phosphorylation, and in complex with Artemis and a DNA hairpin, reveal an essential functional switch. When bound to open DNA ends in its protection mode, DNA-PK is inhibited for cis-autophosphorylation of the so-called ABCDE cluster but activated for phosphorylation of other targets. In contrast, DNA hairpin ends promote cis-autophosphorylation. Phosphorylation of four Thr residues in ABCDE leads to gross structural rearrangement of DNA-PK, widening the DNA binding groove for Artemis recruitment and hairpin cleavage. Meanwhile, Artemis locks DNA-PK into the kinase-inactive state. Kinase activity and autophosphorylation of DNA-PK are regulated by different DNA ends, feeding forward to coordinate NHEJ events.

34551311	Cerebellar outputs take polysynaptic routes to reach the rest of the brain, impeding conventional tracing. Here, we quantify pathways between the cerebellum and forebrain by using transsynaptic tracing viruses and a whole-brain analysis pipeline. With retrograde tracing, we find that most descending paths originate from the somatomotor cortex. Anterograde tracing of ascending paths encompasses most thalamic nuclei, especially ventral posteromedial, lateral posterior, mediodorsal, and reticular nuclei. In the neocortex, sensorimotor regions contain the most labeled neurons, but we find higher densities in associative areas, including orbital, anterior cingulate, prelimbic, and infralimbic cortex. Patterns of ascending expression correlate with c-Fos expression after optogenetic inhibition of Purkinje cells. Our results reveal homologous networks linking single areas of the cerebellar cortex to diverse forebrain targets. We conclude that shared areas of the cerebellum are positioned to provide sensory-motor information to regions implicated in both movement and nonmotor function.

34936866	The ATPase Family AAA Domain Containing 3A (ATAD3A), is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein conserved in metazoans. ATAD3A has been associated with several mitochondrial functions, including nucleoid organization, cholesterol metabolism, and mitochondrial translation. To address its primary role, we generated a neuronal-specific conditional knockout (Atad3 nKO) mouse model, which developed a severe encephalopathy by 5 months of age. Pre-symptomatic mice showed aberrant mitochondrial cristae morphogenesis in the cortex as early as 2 months. Using a multi-omics approach in the CNS of 2-to-3-month-old mice, we found early alterations in the organelle membrane structure. We also show that human ATAD3A associates with different components of the inner membrane, including OXPHOS complex I, Letm1, and prohibitin complexes. Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) shows that ATAD3A is regularly distributed along the inner mitochondrial membrane, suggesting a critical structural role in inner mitochondrial membrane and its organization, most likely in an ATPase-dependent manner.

34774795	ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B member 11 (ABCB11) is an efflux transporter for bile acids on the liver canalicular membrane. The expression of this transporter is reduced in cholestasis; however, the mechanisms contributing to this reduction are unclear. In this study, we sought to determine whether miR-199a-5p contributes to the depletion of ABCB11/Abcb11 in cholestasis in mice. In a microRNA (miRNA) screen of mouse liver after common bile duct ligation (CBDL), we found that miR-199a-5p was significantly upregulated by approximately fourfold. In silico analysis predicted that miR-199a-5p would target the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of ABCB11/Abcb11 mRNA. The expression of ABCB11-3'-UTR luciferase construct in Huh-7 cells was markedly inhibited by cotransfection of a miRNA-199a-5p mimic, which was reversed by an miRNA-199a-5p mimic inhibitor. We also show treatment of mice after CBDL with the potent nuclear receptor FXR agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) significantly increased Abcb11 mRNA and protein and decreased miR-199a-5p expression. Computational mapping revealed a well-conserved FXR-binding site (FXRE) in the promoter of the gene encoding miR-199a-5, termed miR199a-2. Electromobility shift, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and miR199a-2 promoter-luciferase assays confirmed that this binding site was functional. Finally, CBDL in mice led to depletion of nuclear repressor NcoR1 binding at the miR199a-2 promoter, which facilitates transcription of miR199a-2. In CBDL mice treated with OCA, NcoR1 recruitment to the miR199a-2 FXRE was maintained at levels found in sham-operated mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate that miR-199a-5p is involved in regulating ABCB11/Abcb11 expression, is aberrantly upregulated in obstructive cholestasis, and is downregulated by the FXR agonist OCA.	miR-199a-5p inhibits the expression of ABCB11 in obstructive cholestasis.

34686347	Clinical evidence suggests that rapid and sustained antidepressant action can be attained with a single exposure to psychedelics. However, the biological substrates and key mediators of psychedelics' enduring action remain unknown. Here, we show that a single administration of the psychedelic DOI produces fast-acting effects on frontal cortex dendritic spine structure and acceleration of fear extinction via the 5-HT2A receptor. Additionally, a single dose of DOI leads to changes in chromatin organization, particularly at enhancer regions of genes involved in synaptic assembly that stretch for days after the psychedelic exposure. These DOI-induced alterations in the neuronal epigenome overlap with genetic loci associated with schizophrenia, depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Together, these data support that epigenomic-driven changes in synaptic plasticity sustain psychedelics' long-lasting antidepressant action but also warn about potential substrate overlap with genetic risks for certain psychiatric conditions.

34487763	Hibernation is an example of extreme hypometabolic behavior. How mammals achieve such a state of suspended animation remains unclear. Here we show that several strains of type 2 diabetic mice spontaneously enter into hibernation-like suspended animation (HLSA) in cold temperatures. Nondiabetic mice injected with ATP mimic the severe hypothermia analogous to that observed in diabetic mice. We identified that uric acid, an ATP metabolite, is a key molecular in the entry of HLSA. Uric acid binds to the Na(+) binding pocket of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger protein and inhibits its activity, acidifying the cytoplasm and triggering a drop in metabolic rate. The suppression of uric acid biosynthesis blocks the occurrence of HLSA, and hyperuricemic mice induced by treatment with an uricase inhibitor can spontaneously enter into HLSA similar to that observed in type 2 diabetic mice. In rats and dogs, injection of ATP induces a reversible state of HLSA similar to that seen in mice. However, ATP injection fails to induce HLSA in pigs due to the lack of their ability to accumulate uric acid. Our results raise the possibility that nonhibernating mammals could spontaneously undergo HLSA upon accumulation of ATP metabolite, uric acid.

34965430	The basal ganglia (BG) are a group of subcortical nuclei responsible for motor and executive function. Central to BG function are striatal cells expressing D1 (D1R) and D2 (D2R) dopamine receptors. D1R and D2R cells are considered functional antagonists that facilitate voluntary movements and inhibit competing motor patterns, respectively. However, whether they maintain a uniform function across the striatum and what influence they exert outside the BG is unclear. Here, we address these questions by combining optogenetic activation of D1R and D2R cells in the mouse ventrolateral caudoputamen with fMRI. Striatal D1R/D2R stimulation evokes distinct activity within the BG-thalamocortical network and differentially engages cerebellar and prefrontal regions. Computational modeling of effective connectivity confirms that changes in D1R/D2R output drive functional relationships between these regions. Our results suggest a complex functional organization of striatal D1R/D2R cells and hint toward an interconnected fronto-BG-cerebellar network modulated by striatal D1R and D2R cells.	Optogenetic activation of striatal D1R and D2R cells differentially engages downstream connected areas beyond the basal ganglia.	Cell reports	0.0	0
34736896	Synucleins, a family of three proteins highly expressed in neurons, are predominantly known for the direct involvement of alpha-synuclein in the etiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson's and certain other neurodegenerative diseases, but their precise physiological functions are still not fully understood. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of alpha-synuclein as a modulator of various mechanisms implicated in chemical neurotransmission, but information concerning the involvement of other synuclein family members, beta-synuclein and gamma-synuclein, in molecular processes within presynaptic terminals is limited. Here, we demonstrated that the vesicular monoamine transporter 2-dependent dopamine uptake by synaptic vesicles isolated from the striatum of mice lacking beta-synuclein is significantly reduced. Reciprocally, reintroduction, either in vivo or in vitro, of beta-synuclein but not alpha-synuclein or gamma-synuclein improves uptake by triple alpha/beta/gamma-synuclein-deficient striatal vesicles. We also showed that the resistance of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta to subchronic administration of the Parkinson's disease-inducing prodrug 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine depends on the presence of beta-synuclein but only when one or both other synucleins are absent. Furthermore, proteomic analysis of synuclein-deficient synaptic vesicles versus those containing only beta-synuclein revealed differences in their protein compositions. We suggest that the observed potentiation of dopamine uptake by beta-synuclein might be caused by different protein architecture of the synaptic vesicles. It is also feasible that such structural changes improve synaptic vesicle sequestration of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, a toxic metabolite of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, which would explain why dopaminergic neurons expressing beta-synuclein and lacking alpha-synuclein and/or gamma-synuclein are resistant to this neurotoxin.	beta-synuclein potentiates synaptic vesicle dopamine uptake and rescues dopaminergic neurons from MPTP-induced death in the absence of other synucleins.

34525364	Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) produces hallucinations, which are perceptions uncoupled from the external environment. How LSD alters neuronal activities in vivo that underlie abnormal perceptions is unknown. Here, we show that when rats run along a familiar track, hippocampal place cells under LSD reduce their firing rates, their directionality, and their interaction with visual cortical neurons. However, both hippocampal and visual cortical neurons temporarily increase firing rates during head-twitching, a behavioral signature of a hallucination-like state in rodents. When rats are immobile on the track, LSD enhances cortical firing synchrony in a state similar to the wakefulness-to-sleep transition, during which the hippocampal-cortical interaction remains dampened while hippocampal awake reactivation is maintained. Our results suggest that LSD suppresses hippocampal-cortical interactions during active behavior and during immobility, leading to internal hippocampal representations that are degraded and isolated from external sensory input. These effects may contribute to LSD-produced abnormal perceptions.	LSD degrades hippocampal spatial representations and suppresses hippocampal-visual cortical interactions.	Cell reports	0.0	0
34861240	Well-orchestrated maternal-fetal cross talk occurs via secreted ligands, interacting receptors, and coupled intracellular pathways between the conceptus and endometrium and is essential for successful embryo implantation. However, previous studies mostly focus on either the conceptus or the endometrium in isolation. The lack of integrated analysis impedes our understanding of early maternal-fetal cross talk. Herein, focusing on ligand-receptor complexes and coupled pathways at the maternal-fetal interface in sheep, we provide the first comprehensive proteomic map of ligand-receptor pathway cascades essential for embryo implantation. We demonstrate that these cascades are associated with cell adhesion and invasion, redox homeostasis, and the immune response. Candidate interactions and their physiological roles were further validated by functional experiments. We reveal the physical interaction of albumin and claudin 4 and their roles in facilitating embryo attachment to endometrium. We also demonstrate a novel function of enhanced conceptus glycolysis in remodeling uterine receptivity by inducing endometrial histone lactylation, a newly identified histone modification. Results from in vitro and in vivo models supported the essential role of lactate in inducing endometrial H3K18 lactylation and in regulating redox homeostasis and apoptotic balance to ensure successful implantation. By reconstructing a map of potential ligand-receptor pathway cascades at the maternal-fetal interface, our study presents new concepts for understanding molecular and cellular mechanisms that fine-tune conceptus-endometrium cross talk during implantation. This provides more direct and accurate insights for developing potential clinical intervention strategies to improve pregnancy outcomes following both natural and assisted conception.

34728807	Loss-of-function alterations of Neurofibromin 1 (NF1) activate RAS, a driver of colorectal cancer. However, the clinical implications of NF1 alterations are largely unknown. We performed a comprehensive molecular profiling of NF1-mutant colorectal cancer using data from 8150 patients included in a dataset of commercial CLIA-certified laboratory (Caris Life Sciences). In addition, NF1 expression levels were tested for associations with clinical outcomes using data from 431 patients in the CALGB/SWOG 80405 trial. In the Caris dataset, 2.2% of patients had pathogenic or presumed pathogenic NF1 mutations. NF1-mutant tumors more frequently harbored PIK3CA (25.0% vs. 16.7%) and PTEN mutations (24.0% vs. 4.2%) than wild type tumors. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that MAPK and PI3K pathway signatures were enriched in NF1-mutant tumors. In the CALGB/SWOG 80405 cohort, low NF1 expression was associated with poor prognosis, and high NF1 expression was associated with better efficacy of cetuximab than bevacizumab. Together, we revealed concurrent genetic alterations in the PI3K pathways in NF1-mutant tumors, suggesting the need to simultaneously block MAPK and PI3K pathways in treatment. The potential of NF1 alteration as a novel biomarker for targeted therapy was highlighted, warranting further investigations in clinical settings.

34758308	Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a key driver of several inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis, in which affected tissues show an interferon-stimulated gene signature. Here, we demonstrate that TNF triggers a type-I interferon response that is dependent on the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. We show that TNF inhibits PINK1-mediated mitophagy and leads to altered mitochondrial function and to an increase in cytosolic mtDNA levels. Using cGAS-chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we demonstrate that cytosolic mtDNA binds to cGAS after TNF treatment. Furthermore, TNF induces a cGAS-STING-dependent transcriptional response that mimics that of macrophages from rheumatoid arthritis patients. Finally, in an inflammatory arthritis mouse model, cGAS deficiency blocked interferon responses and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and joint swelling. These findings elucidate a molecular mechanism linking TNF to type-I interferon signaling and suggest a potential benefit for therapeutic targeting of cGAS/STING in TNF-driven diseases.

34801547	Naturally occurring missense variants of G protein-coupled receptors with loss of function have been linked to metabolic disease in case studies and in animal experiments. The glucagon receptor, one such G protein-coupled receptor, is involved in maintaining blood glucose and amino acid homeostasis; however, loss-of-function mutations of this receptor have not been systematically characterized. Here, we observed fewer glucagon receptor missense variants than expected, as well as lower allele diversity and fewer variants with trait associations as compared with other class B1 receptors. We performed molecular pharmacological phenotyping of 38 missense variants located in the receptor extracellular domain, at the glucagon interface, or with previously suggested clinical implications. These variants were characterized in terms of cAMP accumulation to assess glucagon-induced Galphas coupling, and of recruitment of beta-arrestin-1/2. Fifteen variants were impaired in at least one of these downstream functions, with six variants affected in both cAMP accumulation and beta-arrestin-1/2 recruitment. For the eight variants with decreased Galphas signaling (D63(ECD)N, P86(ECD)S, V96(ECD)E, G125(ECD)C, R225(3.30)H, R308(5.40)W, V368(6.59)M, and R378(7.35)C) binding experiments revealed preserved glucagon affinity, although with significantly reduced binding capacity. Finally, using the UK Biobank, we found that variants with wildtype-like Galphas signaling did not associate with metabolic phenotypes, whereas carriers of cAMP accumulation-impairing variants displayed a tendency toward increased risk of obesity and increased body mass and blood pressure. These observations are in line with the essential role of the glucagon system in metabolism and support that Galphas is the main signaling pathway effecting the physiological roles of the glucagon receptor.

34662580	Neddylation is a posttranslational modification that attaches ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 to protein targets via Nedd8-specific E1-E2-E3 enzymes and modulates many important biological processes. Nedd8 attaches to a lysine residue of a substrate, not for degradation, but for modulation of substrate activity. We previously identified the HECT-type ubiquitin ligase Smurf1, which controls diverse cellular processes, is activated by Nedd8 through covalent neddylation. Smurf1 functions as a thioester bond-type Nedd8 ligase to catalyze its own neddylation. Numerous ubiquitination substrates of Smurf1 have been identified, but the neddylation substrates of Smurf1 remain unknown. Here, we show that Smurf1 interacts with RRP9, a core component of the U3 snoRNP complex, which is involved in pre-rRNA processing. Our in vivo and in vitro neddylation modification assays show that RRP9 is conjugated with Nedd8. RRP9 neddylation is catalyzed by Smurf1 and removed by the NEDP1 deneddylase. We identified Lys221 as a major neddylation site on RRP9. Deficiency of RRP9 neddylation inhibits pre-rRNA processing and leads to downregulation of ribosomal biogenesis. Consequently, functional studies suggest that ectopic expression of RRP9 promotes tumor cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell migration, whereas unneddylated RRP9, K221R mutant has no such effect. Furthermore, in human colorectal cancer, elevated expression of RRP9 and Smurf1 correlates with cancer progression. These results reveal that Smurf1 plays a multifaceted role in pre-rRNA processing by catalyzing RRP9 neddylation and shed new light on the oncogenic role of RRP9.

34822841	The Escherichia coli yobA-yebZ-yebY (AZY) operon encodes the proteins YobA, YebZ, and YebY. YobA and YebZ are homologs of the CopC periplasmic copper-binding protein and the CopD putative copper importer, respectively, whereas YebY belongs to the uncharacterized Domain of Unknown Function 2511 family. Despite numerous studies of E. coli copper homeostasis and the existence of the AZY operon in a range of bacteria, the operon's proteins and their functional roles have not been explored. In this study, we present the first biochemical and functional studies of the AZY proteins. Biochemical characterization and structural modeling indicate that YobA binds a single Cu(2+) ion with high affinity. Bioinformatics analysis shows that YebY is widespread and encoded either in AZY operons or in other genetic contexts unrelated to copper homeostasis. We also determined the 1.8 A resolution crystal structure of E. coli YebY, which closely resembles that of the lantibiotic self-resistance protein MlbQ. Two strictly conserved cysteine residues form a disulfide bond, consistent with the observed periplasmic localization of YebY. Upon treatment with reductants, YebY binds Cu(+) and Cu(2+) with low affinity, as demonstrated by metal-binding analysis and tryptophan fluorescence. Finally, genetic manipulations show that the AZY operon is not involved in copper tolerance or antioxidant defense. Instead, YebY and YobA are required for the activity of the copper-related NADH dehydrogenase II. These results are consistent with a potential role of the AZY operon in copper delivery to membrane proteins.

34915026	Oncogenic multidrug resistance is commonly intrinsic to renal cancer based on the physiological expression of detoxification transporters, particularly ABCB1, thus hampering chemotherapy. ABCB1 activity is directly dependent on its lipid microenvironment, localizing to cholesterol- and sphingomyelin (SM)-rich domains. As ceramides are the sole source for SMs, we hypothesized that ceramide synthase (CerS)-derived ceramides regulate ABCB1 activity. Using data from RNA-Seq databases, we found that patient kidney tumors exhibited increased CerS2 mRNA, which was inversely correlated with CerS6 mRNA in ABCB1(+) clear cell carcinomas. Endogenous elevated CerS2 and lower CerS5/6 mRNA and protein resulted in disproportionately higher CerS2 to CerS5/6 activities (approximately twofold) in chemoresistant ABCB1(high) (A498, Caki-1) compared with chemosensitive ABCB1(low) (ACHN, normal human proximal convoluted tubule cell) cells. In addition, lipidomics analyses by HPLC-MS/MS showed bias toward CerS2-associated C20:0/C20:1-ceramides compared with CerS5/6-associated C14:0/C16:0-ceramides (2:1). SMs were similarly altered. We demonstrated that chemoresistance to doxorubicin in ABCB1(high) cells was partially reversed by inhibitors of de novo ceramide synthesis (l-cycloserine) and CerS (fumonisin B1) in cell viability assays. Downregulation of CerS2/6, but not CerS5, attenuated ABCB1 mRNA, protein, plasma membrane localization, rhodamine 123(+) efflux transport activity, and doxorubicin resistance. Similar findings were observed with catalytically inactive CerS6-H212A. Furthermore, CerS6-targeting siRNA shifted ceramide and SM composition to ultra long-chain species (C22-C26). Inhibitors of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (eeyarestatin I) and the proteasome (MG132, bortezomib) prevented ABCB1 loss induced by CerS2/6 downregulation. We conclude that a critical balance in ceramide/SM species is prerequisite to ABCB1 expression and functionalization, which could be targeted to reverse multidrug resistance in renal cancers.

34600887	In Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), surface-exposed Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is a key determinant of immunogenicity, yet its intrinsic heterogeneity confounds typical structure-function analysis. Recently, LAM gained a strong foothold as a validated marker for active tuberculosis (TB) infection and has shown great potential in new diagnostic efforts. However, no efforts have yet been made to model or evaluate the impact of mixed polyclonal Mtb infections (infection with multiple strains) on TB diagnostic procedures other than antibiotic susceptibility testing. Here, we selected three TB clinical isolates (HN878, EAI, and IO) and purified LAM from these strains to present an integrated analytical approach of one-dimensional and two-dimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, as well as enzymatic digestion and site-specific mass spectrometry (MS) to probe LAM structure and behavior at multiple levels. Overall, we found that the glycan was similar in all LAM preparations, albeit with subtle variations. Succinates, lactates, hydroxybutyrate, acetate, and the hallmark of Mtb LAM-methylthioxylose (MTX), adorned the nonreducing terminal arabinan of these LAM species. Newly identified acetoxy/hydroxybutyrate was present only in LAM from EAI and IO Mtb strains. Notably, detailed LC/MS-MS unambiguously showed that all acyl modifications and the lactyl ether in LAM are at the 3-OH position of the 2-linked arabinofuranose adjacent to the terminal beta-arabinofuranose. Finally, after sequential enzymatic deglycosylation of LAM, the residual glycan that has approximately 50% of alpha-arabinofuranose -(1-->5) linked did not bind to monoclonal antibody CS35. These data clearly indicate the importance of the arabinan termini arrangements for the antigenicity of LAM.

34715124	The marine bacterium Vibrio campbellii expresses a chitooligosaccharide-specific outer-membrane channel (chitoporin) for the efficient uptake of nutritional chitosugars that are externally produced through enzymic degradation of environmental host shell chitin. However, the principles behind the distinct substrate selectivity of chitoporins are unclear. Here, we employed black lipid membrane (BLM) electrophysiology, which handles the measurement of the flow of ionic current through porins in phospholipid bilayers for the assessment of porin conductivities, to investigate the pH dependency of chitosugar-chitoporin interactions for the bacterium's natural substrate chitohexaose and its deacetylated form, chitosan hexaose. We show that efficient passage of the N-acetylated chitohexaose through the chitoporin is facilitated by its strong affinity for the pore. In contrast, the deacetylated chitosan hexaose is impermeant; however, protonation of the C2 amino entities of chitosan hexaose allows it to be pulled through the channel in the presence of a transmembrane electric field. We concluded from this the crucial role of C2-substitution as the determining factor for chitoporin entry. A change from N-acetylamino- to amino-substitution effectively abolished the ability of approaching molecules to enter the chitoporin, with deacetylation leading to loss of the distinctive structural features of nanopore opening and pore access of chitosugars. These findings provide further understanding of the multistep pathway of chitin utilization by marine Vibrio bacteria and may guide the development of solid-state or genetically engineered biological nanopores for relevant technological applications.

34802033	Chromosome 8q gain is associated with poor clinical outcomes in prostate cancer, but the underlying biological mechanisms remain to be clarified. CSN5, a putative androgen receptor (AR) partner that is located on chromosome 8q, is the key subunit of the COP9 signalosome, which deactivates ubiquitin ligases. Deregulation of CSN5 could affect diverse cellular functions that contribute to tumor development, but there has been no comprehensive study of its function in prostate cancer. The clinical significance of CSN5 amplification/overexpression was evaluated in 16 prostate cancer clinical cohorts. Its oncogenic activity was assessed by genetic and pharmacologic perturbations of CSN5 activity in prostate cancer cell lines. The molecular mechanisms of CSN5 function were assessed, as was the efficacy of the CSN5 inhibitor CSN5i-3 in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the transcription cofactor activity of CSN5 in prostate cancer cells was determined. The prognostic significance of CSN5 amplification and overexpression in prostate cancer was independent of MYC amplification. Inhibition of CSN5 inhibited its oncogenic function by targeting AR signaling, DNA repair, multiple oncogenic pathways, and spliceosome regulation. Furthermore, inhibition of CSN5 repressed metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in AR-negative prostate cancer cells. Targeting CSN5 with CSN5i-3 showed potent antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, CSN5i-3 synergizes with PARP inhibitors to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth. CSN5 functions as a transcription cofactor to cooperate with multiple transcription factors in prostate cancer. Inhibiting CSN5 strongly attenuates prostate cancer progression and could enhance PARP inhibition efficacy in the treatment of prostate cancer.

34965419	Whether and how the pathogenic disruptions in endosomal trafficking observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are linked to its anatomical vulnerability remain unknown. Here, we began addressing these questions by showing that neurons are enriched with a second retromer core, organized around VPS26b, differentially dedicated to endosomal recycling. Next, by imaging mouse models, we show that the trans-entorhinal cortex, a region most vulnerable to AD, is most susceptible to VPS26b depletion-a finding validated by electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry, and behavior. VPS26b was then found enriched in the trans-entorhinal cortex of human brains, where both VPS26b and the retromer-related receptor SORL1 were found deficient in AD. Finally, by regulating glutamate receptor and SORL1 recycling, we show that VPS26b can mediate regionally selective synaptic dysfunction and SORL1 deficiency. Together with the trans-entorhinal's unique network properties, hypothesized to impose a heavy demand on endosomal recycling, these results suggest a general mechanism that can explain AD's regional vulnerability.

34473992	Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive dementia, psychiatric problems, and chorea, is known to be caused by CAG repeat expansions in the HD gene HTT. However, the mechanism of this pathology is not fully understood. The translesion DNA polymerase theta (Poltheta) carries a large insertion sequence in its catalytic domain, which has been shown to allow DNA loop-outs in the primer strand. As a result of high levels of oxidative DNA damage in neural cells and Poltheta's subsequent involvement in base excision repair of oxidative DNA damage, we hypothesized that Poltheta contributes to CAG repeat expansion while repairing oxidative damage within HTT. Here, we performed Poltheta-catalyzed in vitro DNA synthesis using various CAG*CTG repeat DNA substrates that are similar to base excision repair intermediates. We show that Poltheta efficiently extends (CAG)n*(CTG)n hairpin primers, resulting in hairpin retention and repeat expansion. Poltheta also triggers repeat expansions to pass the threshold for HD when the DNA template contains 35 repeats upward. Strikingly, Poltheta depleted of the catalytic insertion fails to induce repeat expansions regardless of primers and templates used, indicating that the insertion sequence is responsible for Poltheta's error-causing activity. In addition, the level of chromatin-bound Poltheta in HD cells is significantly higher than in non-HD cells and exactly correlates with the degree of CAG repeat expansion, implying Poltheta's involvement in triplet repeat instability. Therefore, we have identified Poltheta as a potent factor that promotes CAG*CTG repeat expansions in HD and other neurodegenerative disorders.

35063095	While measurements of RNA expression have dominated the world of single-cell analyses, new single-cell techniques increasingly allow collection of different data modalities, measuring different molecules, structural connections, and intermolecular interactions. Integrating the resulting multimodal single-cell datasets is a new bioinformatics challenge. Equally important, it is a new experimental design challenge for the bench scientist, who is not only choosing from a myriad of techniques for each data modality but also faces new challenges in experimental design. The ultimate goal is to design, execute, and analyze multimodal single-cell experiments that are more than just descriptive but enable the learning of new causal and mechanistic biology. This objective requires strict consideration of the goals behind the analysis, which might range from mapping the heterogeneity of a cellular population to assembling system-wide causal networks that can further our understanding of cellular functions and eventually lead to models of tissues and organs. We review steps and challenges toward this goal. Single-cell transcriptomics is now a mature technology, and methods to measure proteins, lipids, small-molecule metabolites, and other molecular phenotypes at the single-cell level are rapidly developing. Integrating these single-cell readouts so that each cell has measurements of multiple types of data, e.g., transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes, is expected to allow identification of highly specific cellular subpopulations and to provide the basis for inferring causal biological mechanisms.

34496258	Phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7 consensus sequence coordinates key events during transcription, and its deregulation leads to defects in transcription and RNA processing. Here, we report that the histone deacetylase activity of the fission yeast Hos2/Set3 complex plays an important role in suppressing cryptic initiation of antisense transcription when RNA polymerase II phosphorylation is dysregulated due to the loss of Ssu72 phosphatase. Interestingly, although single Hos2 and Set3 mutants have little effect, loss of Hos2 or Set3 combined with ssu72Delta results in a synergistic increase in antisense transcription globally and correlates with elevated sensitivity to genotoxic agents. We demonstrate a key role for the Ssu72/Hos2/Set3 mechanism in the suppression of cryptic antisense transcription at the 3' end of convergent genes that are most susceptible to these defects, ensuring the fidelity of gene expression within dense genomes of simple eukaryotes.

34793835	The N-terminal region (NTR) of ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels is critical for the regulation of Ca(2+) release during excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in muscle. The NTR hosts numerous mutations linked to skeletal (RyR1) and cardiac (RyR2) myopathies, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Here, we constructed two biosensors by labeling the mouse RyR2 NTR at domains A, B, and C with FRET pairs. Using fluorescence lifetime (FLT) detection of intramolecular FRET signal, we developed high-throughput screening (HTS) assays with these biosensors to identify small-molecule RyR modulators. We then screened a small validation library and identified several hits. Hits with saturable FRET dose-response profiles and previously unreported effects on RyR were further tested using [(3)H]ryanodine binding to isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles to determine effects on intact RyR opening in its natural membrane. We identified three novel inhibitors of both RyR1 and RyR2 and two RyR1-selective inhibitors effective at nanomolar Ca(2+). Two of these hits activated RyR1 only at micromolar Ca(2+), highlighting them as potential enhancers of excitation-contraction coupling. To determine whether such hits can inhibit RyR leak in muscle, we further focused on one, an FDA-approved natural antibiotic, fusidic acid (FA). In skinned skeletal myofibers and permeabilized cardiomyocytes, FA inhibited RyR leak with no detrimental effect on skeletal myofiber excitation-contraction coupling. However, in intact cardiomyocytes, FA induced arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) transients, a cautionary observation for a compound with an otherwise solid safety record. These results indicate that HTS campaigns using the NTR biosensor can identify compounds with therapeutic potential.

34686326	In mouse testis, a heterogeneous population of undifferentiated spermatogonia (Aundiff) harbors spermatogenic stem cell (SSC) potential. Although GFRalpha1(+) Aundiff maintains the self-renewing pool in homeostasis, the functional basis of heterogeneity and the implications for their dynamics remain unresolved. Here, through quantitative lineage tracing of SSC subpopulations, we show that an ensemble of heterogeneous states of SSCs supports homeostatic, persistent spermatogenesis. Such heterogeneity is maintained robustly through stochastic interconversion of SSCs between a renewal-biased Plvap(+)/GFRalpha1(+) state and a differentiation-primed Sox3(+)/GFRalpha1(+) state. In this framework, stem cell commitment occurs not directly but gradually through entry into licensed but uncommitted states. Further, Plvap(+)/GFRalpha1(+) cells divide slowly, in synchrony with the seminiferous epithelial cycle, while Sox3(+)/GFRalpha1(+) cells divide much faster. Such differential cell-cycle dynamics reduces mitotic load, and thereby the potential to acquire harmful de novo mutations of the self-renewing pool, while keeping the SSC density high over the testicular open niche.

34773072	Oncogene induced senescence is a tumor suppressing defense mechanism, in which the cell cycle-dependent protein kinase (CDK) inhibitor p16(INK4A) (encoded by the CDKN2A gene) plays a key role. We previously reported that a transcriptional co-activator chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 (CHD7) mediates oncogenic ras-induced senescence by inducing transcription of the p16(INK4A) gene. In the current study, we identified myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) as the transcriptional factor that recruits CHD7 to the p16(INK4A) promoter, where it mediates oncogenic ras-induced p16(INK4A) transcription and senescence through CHD7, in primary human cells from multiple origins. Moreover, the expression of MZF1 is induced by oncogenic ras in senescent cells through the c-Jun and Ets1 transcriptional factors upon their activation by the Ras-Raf-1-MEK-ERK signaling pathway. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) where activating ras mutations occur frequently, reduced MZF1 expression is observed in tumors, as compared to corresponding normal tissues, and correlates with poor patient survival. Analysis of single cell RNA-sequencing data from PAAD patients revealed that among the tumor cells with normal RB expression levels, those with reduced levels of MZF1 are more likely to express lower p16(INK4A) levels. These findings have identified novel signaling components in the pathway that mediates induction of the p16(INK4A) tumor suppressor and the senescence response, and suggested that MZF1 is a potential tumor suppressor in at least some cancer types, the loss of which contributes to the inactivation of the p16(INK4A)/RB pathway and disruption of senescence in tumor cells with intact RB.

34998823	The cytidine deaminase APOBEC3B (A3B) is an endogenous inducer of somatic mutations and causes chromosomal instability by converting cytosine to uracil in single-stranded DNA. Therefore, identification of factors and mechanisms that mediate A3B expression will be helpful for developing therapeutic approaches to decrease DNA mutagenesis. Arsenic (As) is one well-known mutagen and carcinogen, but the mechanisms by which it induces mutations have not been fully elucidated. Herein, we show that A3B is upregulated and required for As-induced DNA damage and mutagenesis. We found that As treatment causes a decrease of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification near the stop codon of A3B, consequently increasing the stability of A3B mRNA. We further reveal that the demethylase FTO is responsible for As-reduced m6A modification of A3B, leading to increased A3B expression and DNA mutation rates in a manner dependent on the m6A reader YTHDF2. Our in vivo data also confirm that A3B is a downstream target of FTO in As-exposed lung tissues. In addition, FTO protein is highly expressed and positively correlates with the protein levels of A3B in tumor samples from human non-small cell lung cancer patients. These findings indicate a previously unrecognized role of A3B in As-triggered somatic mutation and might open new avenues to reduce DNA mutagenesis by targeting the FTO/m6A axis.	m6A demethylation of cytidine deaminase APOBEC3B mRNA orchestrates arsenic-induced mutagenesis.

34433026	Despite ongoing experiential change, neural activity maintains remarkable stability. Although this is thought to be mediated by homeostatic plasticity, what aspect of neural activity is conserved and how the flexibility necessary for learning and memory is maintained is not fully understood. Experimental studies suggest that there exists network-centered, in addition to the well-studied neuron-centered, control. Here we computationally study such a potential mechanism: input-dependent inhibitory plasticity (IDIP). In a hippocampal model, we show that IDIP can explain the emergence of active and silent place cells as well as remapping following silencing of active place cells. Furthermore, we show that IDIP can also stabilize recurrent dynamics while preserving firing rate heterogeneity and stimulus representation, as well as persistent activity after memory encoding. Hence, the establishment of global network balance with IDIP has diverse functional implications and may be able to explain experimental phenomena across different brain areas.

34389813	Mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy are often hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases such as autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) caused by mutations in the key mitochondrial dynamics protein optic atrophy 1 (Opa1). However, the second messengers linking mitochondrial dysfunction to initiation of mitophagy remain poorly characterized. Here, we show in mammalian and nematode neurons that Opa1 mutations trigger Ca(2+)-dependent mitophagy. Deletion or expression of mutated Opa1 in mouse retinal ganglion cells and Caenorhabditis elegans motor neurons lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, increased cytosolic Ca(2+) levels, and decreased axonal mitochondrial density. Chelation of Ca(2+) restores mitochondrial density in neuronal processes, neuronal function, and viability. Mechanistically, sustained Ca(2+) levels activate calcineurin and AMPK, placed in the same genetic pathway regulating axonal mitochondrial density. Our data reveal that mitophagy in ADOA depends on Ca(2+)-calcineurin-AMPK signaling cascade.

34215846	SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligases play fundamental roles in cellular functions. Typically, substrate phosphorylation is required for SCF recognition and subsequent degradation. However, phospho-dependent substrates remain largely unidentified. Here, using quantitative phoshoproteome approach, we performed a system-wide investigation of phospho-dependent SCF substrates. This strategy identified diverse phospho-dependent candidates. Biochemical verification revealed a mechanism by which SCF(FBXO22) recognizes the motif XXPpSPXPXX as a conserved phosphodegron to target substrates for destruction. We further demonstrated BAG3, a HSP70 co-chaperone, is a bona fide substrate of SCF(FBXO22). FBXO22 mediates BAG3 ubiquitination and degradation that requires ERK-dependent BAG3 phosphorylation at S377. FBXO22 depletion or expression of a stable BAG3 S377A mutant promotes tumor growth via defects in apoptosis and cell cycle progression in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our study identified broad phosphorylation-dependent SCF substrates and demonstrated a phosphodegron recognized by FBXO22 and a novel ERK-FBXO22-BAG3 axis involved in tumorigenesis.

34896395	Mycofactocin (MFT) is a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally-modified redox cofactor found in pathogenic mycobacteria. While MFT biosynthetic proteins have been extensively characterized, the physiological conditions under which MFT biosynthesis is required are not well understood. To gain insights into the mechanisms of regulation of MFT expression in Mycobacterium smegmatis mc(2)155, we investigated the DNA-binding and ligand-binding activities of the putative TetR-like transcription regulator, MftR. In this study, we demonstrated that MftR binds to the mft promoter region. We used DNase I footprinting to identify the 27 bp palindromic operator located 5' to mftA and found it to be highly conserved in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium ulcerans, and Mycobacterium marinum. To determine under which conditions the mft biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) is induced, we screened for effectors of MftR. As a result, we found that MftR binds to long-chain acyl-CoAs with low micromolar affinities. To demonstrate that oleoyl-CoA induces the mft BGC in vivo, we re-engineered a fluorescent protein reporter system to express an MftA-mCherry fusion protein. Using this mCherry fluorescent readout, we show that the mft BGC is upregulated in M. smegmatis mc(2)155 when oleic acid is supplemented to the media. These results suggest that MftR controls expression of the mft BGC and that MFT production is induced by long-chain acyl-CoAs. Since MFT-dependent dehydrogenases are known to colocalize with acyl carrier protein/CoA-modifying enzymes, these results suggest that MFT might be critical for fatty acid metabolism or cell wall reorganization.	Biosynthesis of the redox cofactor mycofactocin is controlled by the transcriptional regulator MftR and induced by long-chain acyl-CoA species.	The Journal of biological chemistry	2.5	1
34644583	One of the most intriguing features of cell-cycle control is that, although there are multiple cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in higher eukaryotes, a single CDK is responsible for both G1-S and G2-M in yeasts. By leveraging a rapid conditional silencing system in human cell lines, we confirm that CDK1 assumes the role of G1-S CDK in the absence of CDK2. Unexpectedly, CDK1 deficiency does not prevent mitotic entry. Nonetheless, inadequate phosphorylation of mitotic substrates by noncanonical cyclin B-CDK2 complexes does not allow progression beyond metaphase and underscores deleterious late mitotic events, including the uncoupling of anaphase A and B and cytokinesis. Elevation of CDK2 to a level similar to CDK1 overcomes the mitotic defects caused by CDK1 deficiency, indicating that the relatively low concentration of CDK2 accounts for the defective anaphase. Collectively, these results reveal that the difference between G2-M and G1-S CDKs in human cells is essentially quantitative.	Quantitative differences between cyclin-dependent kinases underlie the unique functions of CDK1 in human cells.	Cell reports	0.0	0
34469728	The Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway suppresses transposable elements and promotes fertility in diverse organisms. Maturation of piRNAs involves pre-piRNA trimming followed by 2'-O-methylation at their 3' termini. Here, we report that the 3' termini of Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs are subject to nontemplated nucleotide addition, and piRNAs with 3' addition exhibit extensive base-pairing interaction with their target RNAs. Animals deficient for PARN-1 (pre-piRNA trimmer) and HENN-1 (2'-O-methyltransferase) accumulate piRNAs with 3' nontemplated nucleotides. In henn-1 mutants, piRNAs are shortened prior to 3' addition, whereas long isoforms of untrimmed piRNAs are preferentially modified in parn-1 mutant animals. Loss of either PARN-1 or HENN-1 results in modest reduction in steady-state levels of piRNAs. Deletion of both enzymes leads to depletion of piRNAs, desilenced piRNA targets, and impaired fecundity. Together, our findings suggest that pre-piRNA trimming and 2'-O-methylation act collaboratively to protect piRNAs from tailing and degradation.	pre-piRNA trimming and 2'-O-methylation protect piRNAs from 3' tailing and degradation in C. elegans.

34537244	Different forms of photoreceptor degeneration cause blindness. Retinal degeneration-3 protein (RD3) deficiency in photoreceptors leads to recessive congenital blindness. We proposed that aberrant activation of the retinal membrane guanylyl cyclase (RetGC) by its calcium-sensor proteins (guanylyl cyclase-activating protein [GCAP]) causes this retinal degeneration and that RD3 protects photoreceptors by preventing such activation. We here present in vivo evidence that RD3 protects photoreceptors by suppressing activation of both RetGC1 and RetGC2 isozymes. We further suggested that insufficient inhibition of RetGC by RD3 could contribute to some dominant forms of retinal degeneration. The R838S substitution in RetGC1 that causes autosomal-dominant cone-rod dystrophy 6, not only impedes deceleration of RetGC1 activity by Ca(2+)GCAPs but also elevates this isozyme's resistance to inhibition by RD3. We found that RD3 prolongs the survival of photoreceptors in transgenic mice harboring human R838S RetGC1 (R838S(+)). Overexpression of GFP-tagged human RD3 did not improve the calcium sensitivity of cGMP production in R838S(+) retinas but slowed the progression of retinal blindness and photoreceptor degeneration. Fluorescence of the GFP-tagged RD3 in the retina only partially overlapped with immunofluorescence of RetGC1 or GCAP1, indicating that RD3 separates from the enzyme before the RetGC1:GCAP1 complex is formed in the photoreceptor outer segment. Most importantly, our in vivo results indicate that, in addition to the abnormal Ca(2+) sensitivity of R838S RetGC1 in the outer segment, the mutated RetGC1 becomes resistant to inhibition by RD3 in a different cellular compartment(s) and suggest that RD3 overexpression could be utilized to reduce the severity of cone-rod dystrophy 6 pathology.

34973336	Therapeutic antibody development requires discovery of an antibody molecule with desired specificities and drug-like properties. For toxicological studies, a therapeutic antibody must bind the ortholog antigen with a similar affinity to the human target to enable relevant dosing regimens, and antibodies falling short of this affinity design goal may not progress as therapeutic leads. Herein, we report the novel use of mammalian recombination signal sequence (RSS)-directed recombination for complementarity-determining region-targeted protein engineering combined with mammalian display to close the species affinity gap of human interleukin (IL)-13 antibody 731. This fully human antibody has not progressed as a therapeutic in part because of a 400-fold species affinity gap. Using this nonhypothesis-driven affinity maturation method, we generated multiple antibody variants with improved IL-13 affinity, including the highest affinity antibody reported to date (34 fM). Resolution of a cocrystal structure of the optimized antibody with the cynomolgus monkey (or nonhuman primate) IL-13 protein revealed that the RSS-derived mutations introduced multiple successive amino-acid substitutions resulting in a de novo formation of a pi-pi stacking-based protein-protein interaction between the affinity-matured antibody heavy chain and helix C on IL-13, as well as an introduction of an interface-distant residue, which enhanced the light chain-binding affinity to target. These mutations synergized binding of heavy and light chains to the target protein, resulting in a remarkably tight interaction, and providing a proof of concept for a new method of protein engineering, based on synergizing a mammalian display platform with novel RSS-mediated library generation.

34695416	The discovery of extremophiles helped enable the development of groundbreaking technology such as PCR. Temperature variation is often an essential step of these technology platforms, but the effect of temperature on the error rate of polymerases from different origins is underexplored. Here, we applied high-throughput sequencing to profile the error rates of DNA polymerases from psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic origins with single-molecule resolution. We found that the reaction temperature substantially increases substitution and deletion error rates of psychrophilic and mesophilic DNA polymerases. Our motif analysis shows that the substitution error profiles cluster according to phylogenetic similarity of polymerases, not the reaction temperature, thus suggesting that the reaction temperature increases the global error rate of polymerases independent of the sequence context. Intriguingly, we also found that the DNA polymerase I of psychrophilic bacteria exhibits higher polymerization activity than its mesophilic ortholog across all temperature ranges, including down to -19 ( degrees )C, which is well below the freezing temperature of water. Our results provide a useful reference for how the reaction temperature, a crucial parameter of biochemistry, can affect DNA polymerase fidelity in organisms adapted to a wide range of thermal environments.

34919800	Cross-reactivity and direct killing of target cells remain underexplored for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific CD8(+) T cells. Isolation of T cell receptors (TCRs) and overexpression in allogeneic cells allows for extensive T cell reactivity profiling. We identify SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp/NSP12) as highly conserved, likely due to its critical role in the virus life cycle. We perform single-cell TCRalphabeta sequencing in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A( *)02:01-restricted, RdRp-specific T cells from SARS-CoV-2-unexposed individuals. Human T cells expressing these TCRalphabeta constructs kill target cell lines engineered to express full-length RdRp. Three TCR constructs recognize homologous epitopes from common cold coronaviruses, indicating CD8(+) T cells can recognize evolutionarily diverse coronaviruses. Analysis of individual TCR clones may help define vaccine epitopes that can induce long-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.

34929168	A network of protein-protein interactions (PPI) is involved in the activation of (+)-7-iso-jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile), a plant hormone that regulates plant defense responses as well as plant growth and development. In the absence of JA-Ile, inhibitory protein jasmonate-ZIM-domain (JAZ) represses JA-related transcription factors, including a master regulator, MYC. In contrast, when JA-Ile accumulates in response to environmental stresses, PPI occurs between JAZ and the F-box protein COI1, which triggers JAZ degradation, resulting in derepressed MYC that can interact with the transcriptional mediator MED25 and upregulate JA-Ile-related gene expression. Activated JA signaling is eventually suppressed through the catabolism of JA-Ile and feedback suppression by JAZ splice variants containing a cryptic MYC-interacting domain (CMID). However, the detailed structural basis of some PPIs involved in JA-Ile signaling remains unclear. Herein, we analyzed PPI between MYC3 and MED25, focusing on the key interactions that activate the JA-Ile signaling pathway. Biochemical assays revealed that a short binding domain of MED25 (CMIDM) is responsible for the interaction with MYC, and that a bipartite interaction is critical for the formation of a stable complex. We also show the mode of interaction between MED25 and MYC is closely related to that of CMID and MYC. In addition, quantitative analyses on the binding of MYC3-JAZs and MYC3-MED25 revealed the order of binding affinity as JAZ(Jas) < MED25(CMIDM) < JAZ(CMID), suggesting a mechanism for how the transcriptional machinery causes activation and negative feedback regulation during jasmonate signaling. These results further illuminate the transcriptional machinery responsible for JA-Ile signaling.

34158631	During autophagy, the coordinated actions of autophagosomes and lysosomes result in the controlled removal of damaged intracellular organelles and superfluous substrates. The evolutionary conservation of this process and its requirement for maintaining cellular homeostasis emphasizes the need to better dissect the pathways governing its molecular regulation. In our previously performed high-content screen, we assessed the effect of 1530 RNA-binding proteins on autophagy. Among the top regulators, we identified the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A-3 (eIF4A3). Here we show that depletion of eIF4A3 leads to a potent increase in autophagosome and lysosome biogenesis and an enhanced autophagic flux. This is mediated by the key autophagy transcription factor, TFEB, which becomes dephosphorylated and translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it elicits an integrated transcriptional response. We further identified an exon-skipping event in the transcript encoding for the direct TFEB kinase, GSK3B, which leads to a reduction in GSK3B expression and activity. Through analysis of TCGA data, we found a significant upregulation of eIF4A3 expression across several cancer types and confirmed the potential relevance of this newly identified signaling axis in human tumors. Hence, our data suggest a previously unrecognized role for eIF4A3 as a gatekeeper of autophagy through the control of TFEB activation, revealing a new mechanism for autophagy regulation.	eIF4A3 regulates the TFEB-mediated transcriptional response via GSK3B to control autophagy.

34793839	Far-red light photoacclimation exhibited by some cyanobacteria allows these organisms to use the far-red region of the solar spectrum (700-800 nm) for photosynthesis. Part of this process includes the replacement of six photosystem I (PSI) subunits with isoforms that confer the binding of chlorophyll (Chl) f molecules that absorb far-red light (FRL). However, the exact sites at which Chl f molecules are bound are still challenging to determine. To aid in the identification of Chl f-binding sites, we solved the cryo-EM structure of PSI from far-red light-acclimated cells of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7335. We identified six sites that bind Chl f with high specificity and three additional sites that are likely to bind Chl f at lower specificity. All of these binding sites are in the core-antenna regions of PSI, and Chl f was not observed among the electron transfer cofactors. This structural analysis also reveals both conserved and nonconserved Chl f-binding sites, the latter of which exemplify the diversity in FRL-PSI among species. We found that the FRL-PSI structure also contains a bound soluble ferredoxin, PetF1, at low occupancy, which suggests that ferredoxin binds less transiently than expected according to the canonical view of ferredoxin-binding to facilitate electron transfer. We suggest that this may result from structural changes in FRL-PSI that occur specifically during FRL photoacclimation.

34610313	Paternal exposure to environmental stressors elicits distinct changes to the sperm sncRNA profile, modifications that have significant post-fertilization consequences. Despite this knowledge, there remains limited mechanistic understanding of how paternal exposures modify the sperm sncRNA landscape. Here, we report the acute sensitivity of the sperm sncRNA profile to the reproductive toxicant acrylamide. Furthermore, we trace the differential accumulation of acrylamide-responsive sncRNAs to coincide with sperm transit of the proximal (caput) segment of the epididymis, wherein acrylamide exposure alters the abundance of several transcription factors implicated in the expression of acrylamide-sensitive sncRNAs. We also identify extracellular vesicles secreted from the caput epithelium in relaying altered sncRNA profiles to maturing spermatozoa and dysregulated gene expression during early embryonic development following fertilization by acrylamide-exposed spermatozoa. These data provide mechanistic links to account for how environmental insults can alter the sperm epigenome and compromise the transcriptomic profile of early embryos.

34543623	Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) plays a key role in intracellular lipolysis, the mobilization of stored triacylglycerol. This work provides an important basis for generating reproducible and detailed data on the hydrolytic and transacylation activities of ATGL. We generated full-length and C-terminally truncated ATGL variants fused with various affinity tags and analyzed their expression in different hosts, namely E.coli, the insect cell line Sf9, and the mammalian cell line human embryonic kidney 293T. Based on this screen, we expressed a fusion protein of ATGL covering residues M1-D288 flanked with N-terminal and C-terminal purification tags. Using these fusions, we identified key steps in expression and purification protocols, including production in the E. coli strain ArcticExpress (DE3) and removal of copurified chaperones. The resulting purified ATGL variant demonstrated improved lipolytic activity compared with previously published data, and it could be stimulated by the coactivator protein comparative gene identification-58 and inhibited by the protein G0/G1 switch protein 2. Shock freezing and storage did not affect the basal activity but reduced coactivation of ATGL by comparative gene identification 58. In vitro, the truncated ATGL variant demonstrated acyl-CoA-independent transacylation activity when diacylglycerol was offered as substrate, resulting in the formation of fatty acid as well as triacylglycerol and monoacylglycerol. However, the ATGL variant showed neither hydrolytic activity nor transacylation activity upon offering of monoacylglycerol as substrate. To understand the role of ATGL in different physiological contexts, it is critical for future studies to identify all its different functions and to determine under what conditions these activities occur.

34506741	Cellular immunity is important in determining the disease severity of COVID-19 patients. However, current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes mediating cellular immunity is limited. Here we apply T-Scan, a recently developed method, to identify CD8(+) T cell epitopes from COVID-19 patients of four major HLA-A alleles. Several identified epitopes are conserved across human coronaviruses, which might mediate pre-existing cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we identify and validate four epitopes that were mutated in the newly circulating variants, including the Delta variant. The mutations significantly reduce T cell responses to the epitope peptides in convalescent and vaccinated samples. We further determine the crystal structure of HLA-A( *)02:01/HLA-A( *)24:02 in complex with the epitope KIA_S/NYN_S, respectively, which reveals the importance of K417 and L452 of the spike protein for binding to HLA.

34562454	DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) is known primarily for its function in DNA double-stranded break repair and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). However, DNA-PKcs also has a critical yet undefined role in immunity impacting both myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages spurring interest in targeting DNA-PKcs for therapeutic strategies in immune-related diseases. To gain insight into the function of DNA-PKcs within immune cells, we performed a quantitative phosphoproteomic screen in T cells to identify phosphorylation targets of DNA-PKcs. Our results indicate that DNA-PKcs phosphorylates the transcription factor Egr1 (early growth response protein 1) at serine 301. Expression of Egr1 is induced early upon T cell activation and dictates T cell response by modulating expression of cytokines and key costimulatory molecules such as IL (interleukin) 2, IL6, IFNgamma, and NFkappaB. Inhibition of DNA-PKcs by treatment with a DNA-PKcs specific inhibitor NU7441 or shRNA knockdown increased proteasomal degradation of Egr1. Mutation of serine 301 to alanine via CRISPR-Cas9 reduced EGR1 protein expression and decreased Egr1-dependent transcription of IL2 in activated T cells. Our findings identify DNA-PKcs as a critical intermediary link between T cell activation and T cell fate and a novel phosphosite involved in regulating Egr1 activity.

34615996	Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family proteins are epigenetic readers that play a critical role in oncogenesis by controlling the expression of oncogenes such as c-Myc. Targeting BET family proteins has recently emerged as a promising anticancer strategy. However, the molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells respond to BET inhibition are not well understood. In this study, we found that inducing the degradation of BET proteins by the proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTAC) approach potently suppressed the growth of colorectal cancer (CRC) including patient-derived tumors. Mechanistically, BET degradation transcriptionally activates Death Receptor 5 (DR5) to trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) in CRC cells. Enhanced DR5 induction further sensitizes CRC cells with a mutation in Speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP). Furthermore, DR5 is indispensable for a striking antitumor effect of combining BET degradation and anti-PD-1 antibody, which was well tolerated in mice and almost eradicated syngeneic tumors. Our results demonstrate that BET degradation triggers DR5-mediated ICD to potently suppress CRC and potentiate immune checkpoint blockade. These results provide a rationale, mechanistic insights, and potential biomarkers for developing a precision CRC therapy by inducing BET protein degradation.

34655614	As a central player in the canonical TGF-beta signaling pathway, Smad2 transmits the activation of TGF-beta receptors at the plasma membrane (PM) to transcriptional regulation in the nucleus. Although it has been well established that binding of TGF-beta to its receptors leads to the recruitment and activation of Smad2, the spatiotemporal mechanism by which Smad2 is recruited to the activated TGF-beta receptor complex and activated is not fully understood. Here we show that Smad2 selectively and tightly binds phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) in the PM. The PI(4,5)P2-binding site is located in the MH2 domain that is involved in interaction with the TGF-beta receptor I that transduces TGF-beta-receptor binding to downstream signaling proteins. Quantitative optical imaging analyses show that PM recruitment of Smad2 is triggered by its interaction with PI(4,5)P2 that is locally enriched near the activated TGF-beta receptor complex, leading to its binding to the TGF-beta receptor I. The PI(4,5)P2-binding activity of Smad2 is essential for the TGF-beta-stimulated phosphorylation, nuclear transport, and transcriptional activity of Smad2. Structural comparison of all Smad MH2 domains suggests that membrane lipids may also interact with other Smad proteins and regulate their function in diverse TGF-beta-mediated biological processes.

34818535	Strengthening the gut epithelial barrier is a potential strategy for management of gut microbiota-associated illnesses. Here, we demonstrate that dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (Dusp6) knockout enhances baseline colon barrier integrity and ameliorates dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colonic injury. DUSP6 mutation in Caco-2 cells enhances the epithelial feature and increases mitochondrial oxygen consumption, accompanied by altered glucose metabolism and decreased glycolysis. We find that Dusp6-knockout mice are more resistant to DSS-induced dysbiosis, and the cohousing and fecal microbiota transplantation experiments show that the gut/fecal microbiota derived from Dusp6-knockout mice also confers protection against colitis. Further culturomics and mono-colonialization experiments show that one gut microbiota member in the genus Duncaniella confers host protection from DSS-induced injury.

34784249	The formation of Ca(2+) microdomains during T cell activation is initiated by the production of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) from its reduced form NAADPH. The reverse reaction-NAADP to NAADPH-is catalyzed by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). Here, we identified NADPH oxidases NOX and DUOX as NAADP-forming enzymes that convert NAADPH to NAADP under physiological conditions in vitro. T cells express NOX1, NOX2, and, to a minor extent, DUOX1 and DUOX2. Local and global Ca(2+) signaling were decreased in mouse T cells with double knockout of Duoxa1 and Duoxa2 but not with knockout of Nox1 or Nox2. Ca(2+) microdomains in the first 15 s upon T cell activation were significantly decreased in Duox2(-/-) but not in Duox1(-/-) T cells, whereas both DUOX1 and DUOX2 were required for global Ca(2+) signaling between 4 and 12 min after stimulation. Our findings suggest that a DUOX2- and G6PD-catalyzed redox cycle rapidly produces and degrades NAADP through NAADPH as an inactive intermediate.	Dual NADPH oxidases DUOX1 and DUOX2 synthesize NAADP and are necessary for Ca(2+) signaling during T cell activation.	Science signaling	1.0	0

34852222	The persistence of anti-viral immunity is essential for protection and exhibits profound heterogeneity across individuals. Here, we elucidate the factors that shape maintenance and function of anti-viral T cell immunity in the body by comprehensive profiling of virus-specific T cells across blood, lymphoid organs, and mucosal tissues of organ donors. We use flow cytometry, T cell receptor sequencing, single-cell transcriptomics, and cytokine analysis to profile virus-specific CD8(+) T cells recognizing the ubiquitous pathogens influenza and cytomegalovirus. Our results reveal that virus specificity determines overall magnitude, tissue distribution, differentiation, and clonal repertoire of virus-specific T cells. Age and sex influence T cell differentiation and dissemination in tissues, while T cell tissue residence and functionality are highly correlated with the site. Together, our results demonstrate how the covariates of virus, tissue, age, and sex impact the anti-viral immune response, which is important for targeting, monitoring, and predicting immune responses to existing and emerging viruses.

34563540	The D614G mutation in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 alters the fitness of the virus, leading to the dominant form observed in the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the molecular basis of the mechanism by which this mutation enhances fitness is not clear. Here we demonstrated by cryo-electron microscopy that the D614G mutation resulted in increased propensity of multiple receptor-binding domains (RBDs) in an upward conformation poised for host receptor binding. Multiple substates within the one RBD-up or two RBD-up conformational space were determined. According to negative staining electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and differential scanning fluorimetry, the most significant impact of the mutation lies in its ability to eliminate the unusual cold-induced unfolding characteristics and to significantly increase the thermal stability under physiological pH. The D614G spike variant also exhibited exceptional long-term stability when stored at 37 degrees C for up to 2 months. Our findings shed light on how the D614G mutation enhances the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 through a stabilizing mutation and suggest an approach for better design of spike protein-based conjugates for vaccine development.

34842321	"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technique for dissecting the complexity of normal and diseased tissues, enabling characterization of cell diversity and heterogeneous phenotypic states in unprecedented detail. However, this technology has been underutilized for exploring the interactions between the host cell and viral pathogens in latently infected cells. Herein, we use scRNA-seq and single-molecule sensitivity fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) technologies to investigate host single-cell transcriptome changes upon the reactivation of a human neurotropic virus, herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). We identify the stress sensor growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 beta (Gadd45b) as a critical antiviral host factor that regulates HSV-1 reactivation events in a subpopulation of latently infected primary neurons. We show that distinct subcellular localization of Gadd45b correlates with the viral late gene expression program, as well as the expression of the viral transcription factor, ICP4. We propose that a hallmark of a ""successful"" or ""aborted"" HSV-1 reactivation state in primary neurons is determined by a unique subcellular localization signature of the stress sensor Gadd45b."

34965431	Mechanisms have evolved that allow cells to detect signals and generate an appropriate response. The accuracy of these responses relies on the ability of cells to discriminate between signal and noise. How cells filter noise in signaling pathways is not well understood. Here, we analyze noise suppression in the yeast pheromone signaling pathway and show that the poorly characterized protein Kel1 serves as a major noise suppressor and prevents cell death. At the molecular level, Kel1 prevents spontaneous activation of the pheromone response by inhibiting membrane recruitment of Ste5 and Far1. Only a hypophosphorylated form of Kel1 suppresses signaling, reduces noise, and prevents pheromone-associated cell death, and our data indicate that the MAPK Fus3 contributes to Kel1 phosphorylation. Taken together, Kel1 serves as a phospho-regulated suppressor of the pheromone pathway to reduce noise, inhibit spontaneous activation of the pathway, regulate mating efficiency, and prevent pheromone-associated cell death.	Kel1 is a phosphorylation-regulated noise suppressor of the pheromone signaling pathway.	Cell reports	2.0	0
34626645	Amyloid fibrils, crystal-like fibrillar aggregates of proteins associated with various amyloidoses, have the potential to propagate via a prion-like mechanism. Among known methodologies to dissolve preformed amyloid fibrils, acid treatment has been used with the expectation that the acids will degrade amyloid fibrils similar to acid inactivation of protein functions. Contrary to our expectation, treatment with strong acids, such as HCl or H2SO4, of beta2-microglobulin (beta2m) or insulin actually promoted amyloid fibril formation, proportionally to the concentration of acid used. A similar promotion was observed at pH 2.0 upon the addition of salts, such as NaCl or Na2SO4. Although trichloroacetic acid, another strong acid, promoted amyloid fibril formation of beta2m, formic acid, a weak acid, did not, suggesting the dominant role of anions in promoting fibril formation of this protein. Comparison of the effects of acids and salts confirmed the critical role of anions, indicating that strong acids likely induce amyloid fibril formation via an anion-binding mechanism. The results suggest that although the addition of strong acids decreases pH, it is not useful for degrading amyloid fibrils, but rather induces or stabilizes amyloid fibrils via an anion-binding mechanism.	Strong acids induce amyloid fibril formation of beta2-microglobulin via an anion-binding mechanism.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0.0	0
34813359	Obesity and metabolic diseases, such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D), are associated with metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Here, we investigated the critical cellular and molecular factors behind this link. We found that primary human adipocytes shed extracellular vesicles, specifically exosomes, that induced the expression of genes associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem-like cell (CSC) traits in cocultured breast cancer cell lines. Transcription of these genes was further increased in cells exposed to exosomes shed from T2D patient-derived adipocytes or insulin-resistant adipocytes and required the epigenetic reader proteins BRD2 and BRD4 in recipient cells. The thrombospondin family protein TSP5, which is associated with cancer, was more abundant in exosomes from T2D or insulin-resistant adipocytes and partially contributed to EMT in recipient cells. Bioinformatic analysis of breast cancer patient tissue showed that greater coexpression of COMP (which encodes TSP5) and BRD2 or BRD3 correlated with poorer prognosis, specifically decreased distant metastasis-free survival. Our findings reveal a mechanism of exosome-mediated cross-talk between metabolically abnormal adipocytes and breast cancer cells that may promote tumor aggressiveness in patients with T2D.

35021088	Cortical processing depends on finely tuned excitatory and inhibitory connections in neuronal microcircuits. Reduced inhibition by somatostatin-expressing interneurons is a key component of altered inhibition associated with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (depression), which is implicated in cognitive deficits and rumination, but the link remains to be better established mechanistically in humans. Here we test the effect of reduced somatostatin interneuron-mediated inhibition on cortical processing in human neuronal microcircuits using a data-driven computational approach. We integrate human cellular, circuit, and gene expression data to generate detailed models of human cortical microcircuits in health and depression. We simulate microcircuit baseline and response activity and find a reduced signal-to-noise ratio and increased false/failed detection of stimuli due to a higher baseline activity in depression. We thus apply models of human cortical microcircuits to demonstrate mechanistically how reduced inhibition impairs cortical processing in depression, providing quantitative links between altered inhibition and cognitive deficits.

34686346	FBXO31 is the substrate receptor of one of many CUL1-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL1) complexes. Here, we show that low FBXO31 mRNA levels are associated with high pre-operative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and Gleason grade in human prostate cancer. Mechanistically, the ubiquitin ligase CRL1(FBXO31) promotes the ubiquitylation-mediated degradation of DUSP6, a dual specificity phosphatase that dephosphorylates and inactivates the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase-1 and -2 (ERK1/2). Depletion of FBXO31 stabilizes DUSP6, suppresses ERK signaling, and activates the PI3K-AKT signaling cascade. Moreover, deletion of FBXO31 promotes tumor development in a mouse orthotopic model of prostate cancer. Treatment with BCI, a small molecule inhibitor of DUSP6, suppresses AKT activation and prevents tumor formation, suggesting that the FBXO31 tumor suppressor activity is dependent on DUSP6. Taken together, our studies highlight the relevance of the FBXO31-DUSP6 axis in the regulation of ERK- and PI3K-AKT-mediated signaling pathways, as well as its therapeutic potential in prostate cancer.	Loss of FBXO31-mediated degradation of DUSP6 dysregulates ERK and PI3K-AKT signaling and promotes prostate tumorigenesis.	Cell reports	0.0	0
34508176	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can exhibit cell-type and cancer-type specific expression profiles, making them highly attractive as therapeutic targets. Pan-cancer RNA sequencing data revealed broad expression of the SAMMSON lncRNA in uveal melanoma (UM), the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. Currently, there are no effective treatments for UM patients with metastatic disease, resulting in a median survival time of 6-12 months. We aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of SAMMSON inhibition in UM. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated SAMMSON inhibition impaired the growth and viability of a genetically diverse panel of uveal melanoma cell lines. These effects were accompanied by an induction of apoptosis and were recapitulated in two uveal melanoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) models through subcutaneous ASO delivery. SAMMSON pulldown revealed several candidate interaction partners, including various proteins involved in mitochondrial translation. Consequently, inhibition of SAMMSON impaired global, mitochondrial and cytosolic protein translation levels and mitochondrial function in uveal melanoma cells. The present study demonstrates that SAMMSON expression is essential for uveal melanoma cell survival. ASO-mediated silencing of SAMMSON may provide an effective treatment strategy to treat primary and metastatic uveal melanoma patients.

35031323	Rho family small GTPases (Rho) regulate various cell motility processes by spatiotemporally controlling the actin cytoskeleton. Some Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) are regulated via tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family tyrosine kinase (SFK). We also previously reported that PLEKHG2, a RhoGEF for the GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, is tyrosine-phosphorylated by SRC. However, the details of the mechanisms by which SFK regulates RhoGEFs are not well understood. In this study, we found for the first time that PLEKHG1, which has very high homology to the Dbl and pleckstrin homology domains of PLEKHG2, activates Cdc42 following activation by FYN, a member of the SFK family. We also show that this activation of PLEKHG1 by FYN requires interaction between these two proteins and FYN-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLEKHG1. We also found that the region containing the Src homology 3 and Src homology 2 domains of FYN is required for this interaction. Finally, we demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr-720 and Tyr-801 in PLEKHG1 is important for the activation of PLEKHG1. These results suggest that FYN is a regulator of PLEKHG1 and may regulate cell morphology through Rho signaling via the interaction with and tyrosine phosphorylation of PLEKHG1.	The Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor PLEKHG1 is activated by interaction with and phosphorylation by Src family kinase member FYN.	The Journal of biological chemistry	4.0	1
35021080	In mice, retinal direction selectivity is organized in a map that aligns to the body and gravitational axes of optic flow, and little is known about how this map develops. We find direction selectivity maps are largely present at eye opening and develop normally in the absence of visual experience. Remarkably, in mice lacking the beta2 subunit of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (beta2-nAChR-KO), which exhibit drastically reduced cholinergic retinal waves in the first postnatal week, selectivity to horizontal motion is absent while selectivity to vertical motion remains. We tested several possible mechanisms that could explain the loss of horizontal direction selectivity in beta2-nAChR-KO mice (wave propagation bias, FRMD7 expression, starburst amacrine cell morphology), but all were found to be intact when compared with WT mice. This work establishes a role for retinal waves in the development of asymmetric circuitry that mediates retinal direction selectivity via an unknown mechanism.

34375637	Plasmodium parasites cause malaria and are responsible annually for hundreds of thousands of deaths. Kinesins are a superfamily of microtubule-dependent ATPases that play important roles in the parasite replicative machinery, which is a potential target for antiparasite drugs. Kinesin-5, a molecular motor that cross-links microtubules, is an established antimitotic target in other disease contexts, but its mechanism in Plasmodium falciparum is unclear. Here, we characterized P. falciparum kinesin-5 (PfK5) using cryo-EM to determine the motor's nucleotide-dependent microtubule-bound structure and introduced 3D classification of individual motors into our microtubule image processing pipeline to maximize our structural insights. Despite sequence divergence in PfK5, the motor exhibits classical kinesin mechanochemistry, including ATP-induced subdomain rearrangement and cover neck bundle formation, consistent with its plus-ended directed motility. We also observed that an insertion in loop5 of the PfK5 motor domain creates a different environment in the well-characterized human kinesin-5 drug-binding site. Our data reveal the possibility for selective inhibition of PfK5 and can be used to inform future exploration of Plasmodium kinesins as antiparasite targets.

34779554	Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) functions as a key sensor for microbial invasion and cellular damage by detecting emerging cytosolic DNA. Here, we report that GTPase-activating protein-(SH3 domain)-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) primes cGAS for its prompt activation by engaging cGAS in a primary liquid-phase condensation state. Using high-resolution microscopy, we show that in resting cells, cGAS exhibits particle-like morphological characteristics, which are markedly weakened when G3BP1 is deleted. Upon DNA challenge, the pre-condensed cGAS undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) more efficiently. Importantly, G3BP1 deficiency or its inhibition dramatically diminishes DNA-induced LLPS and the subsequent activation of cGAS. Interestingly, RNA, previously reported to form condensates with cGAS, does not activate cGAS. Accordingly, we find that DNA - but not RNA - treatment leads to the dissociation of G3BP1 from cGAS. Taken together, our study shows that the primary condensation state of cGAS is critical for its rapid response to DNA.	The stress granule protein G3BP1 promotes pre-condensation of cGAS to allow rapid responses to DNA.	EMBO reports	0.0	0
34517008	African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a large DNA virus that is highly contagious and pathogenic in domestic pigs with a mortality rate up to 100%. However, how ASFV suppresses JAK-STAT1 signaling to evade the immune response remains unclear. In this study, we found that the ASFV-encoded protein MGF-505-7R inhibited proinflammatory IFN-gamma-mediated JAK-STAT1 signaling. Mechanistically, MGF-505-7R was found to interact with JAK1 and JAK2 and mediate their degradation. Further study indicated that MGF-505-7R promoted degradation of JAK1 and JAK2 by upregulating the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF125 expression and inhibiting expression of Hes5, respectively. Consistently, MGF-505-7R-deficient ASFV induced high levels of IRF1 expression and displayed compromised replication both in primary porcine alveolar macrophages and pigs compared with wild-type ASFV. Furthermore, MGF-505-7R deficiency attenuated the virulence of the ASFV and pathogenesis of ASF in pigs. These findings suggest that the JAK-STAT1 axis mediates the innate immune response to the ASFV and that MGF-505-7R plays a critical role in the virulence of the ASFV and pathogenesis of ASF by antagonizing this axis. Thus, we conclude that deletion of MGF-505-7R may serve as a strategy to develop attenuated vaccines against the ASFV.

34499924	The spike protein is the main protein component of the SARS-CoV-2 virion surface. The spike receptor-binding motif mediates recognition of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, a critical step in infection, and is the preferential target for spike-neutralizing antibodies. Posttranslational modifications of the spike receptor-binding motif have been shown to modulate viral infectivity and host immune response, but these modifications are still being explored. Here we studied asparagine deamidation of the spike protein, a spontaneous event that leads to the appearance of aspartic and isoaspartic residues, which affect both the protein backbone and its charge. We used computational prediction and biochemical experiments to identify five deamidation hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Asparagine residues 481 and 501 in the receptor-binding motif deamidate with a half-life of 16.5 and 123 days at 37 degrees C, respectively. Deamidation is significantly slowed at 4 degrees C, indicating a strong dependence of spike protein molecular aging on environmental conditions. Deamidation of the spike receptor-binding motif decreases the equilibrium constant for binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor more than 3.5-fold, yet its high conservation pattern suggests some positive effect on viral fitness. We propose a model for deamidation of the full SARS-CoV-2 virion illustrating how deamidation of the spike receptor-binding motif could lead to the accumulation on the virion surface of a nonnegligible chemically diverse spike population in a timescale of days. Our findings provide a potential mechanism for molecular aging of the spike protein with significant consequences for understanding virus infectivity and vaccine development.

34758310	"Following infection or immunization, memory B cells (MBCs) and long-lived plasma cells provide humoral immunity that can last for decades. Most principles of MBC biology have been determined with hapten-protein carrier models or fluorescent protein immunizations. Here, we examine the temporal dynamics of the germinal center (GC) B cell and MBC response following mouse influenza A virus infection. We find that antiviral B cell responses within the lung-draining mediastinal lymph node (mLN) and the spleen are distinct in regard to duration, enrichment for antigen-binding cells, and class switching dynamics. While splenic GCs dissolve after 6 weeks post-infection, mLN hemagglutinin-specific (HA(+)) GCs can persist for 22 weeks. Persistent GCs continuously differentiate MBCs, with ""peak"" and ""late"" GCs contributing equal numbers of HA(+) MBCs to the long-lived compartment.

34992218	Neuregulin 1 (NRG1), an EGF family member, is expressed in most breast cancers. It promotes breast cancer growth and metastasis in HER2 receptor expressing breast cancer. However, its role in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been extensively investigated. In this study, we observed that NRG1 knockdown resulted in the suppression of TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231 cell and MDA-MB-468 cell) metastasis and downregulation of Fra-1 (FOS-like 1, AP-1 transcription factor subunit, which is an overexpressed transcription factor in TNBC and acts as a coordinator of metastasis). In addition, the transcriptional regulation of Fra-1 by NRG1 was mediated by ERK1/2-induced recruitment of c-Myc (MYC proto-oncogene, transcription factor) to the promoter of Fra-1. Furthermore, c-Myc was targeted by an E3 ligase Fbxw7 and its ubiquitination and degradation by Fbxw7 was regulated by NRG1 expression and ERK1/2-mediated Fbxw7 phosphorylation that results in the dissociation and nuclear import of c-Myc. Taken together, the results of our study demonstrated that NRG1 regulates the Fra-1 expression to coordinate the TNBC metastasis via the novel ERK1/2-Fbxw7-c-Myc pathway and targeting NRG1 expression could be a potential therapeutic strategy for TNBC.

34705028	iASPP is a protein mostly known as an inhibitor of p53 pro-apoptotic activity and a predicted regulatory subunit of the PP1 phosphatase, which is often overexpressed in tumors. We report that iASPP associates with the microtubule plus-end binding protein EB1, a central regulator of microtubule dynamics, via an SxIP motif. iASPP silencing or mutation of the SxIP motif led to defective microtubule capture at the cortex of mitotic cells, leading to abnormal positioning of the mitotic spindle. These effects were recapitulated by the knockdown of the membrane-to-cortex linker Myosin-Ic (Myo1c), which we identified as a novel partner of iASPP. Moreover, iASPP or Myo1c knockdown cells failed to round up upon mitosis because of defective cortical stiffness. We propose that by increasing cortical rigidity, iASPP helps cancer cells maintain a spherical geometry suitable for proper mitotic spindle positioning and chromosome partitioning.	iASPP contributes to cell cortex rigidity, mitotic cell rounding, and spindle positioning.

34657129	Tumor metabolic reprogramming ensures that cancerous cells obtain sufficient building blocks, energy, and antioxidants to sustain rapid growth and for coping with oxidative stress. Neurogenic differentiation factor 1 (NeuroD1) is upregulated in various types of tumors; however, its involvement in tumor cell metabolic reprogramming remains unclear. In this study, we report that NeuroD1 is positively correlated with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), in colorectal cancer cells. In addition, the regulation of G6PD by NeuroD1 alters tumor cell metabolism by stimulating the PPP, leading to enhanced production of nucleotides and NADPH. These, in turn, promote DNA and lipid biosynthesis in tumor cells, while decreasing intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, we showed that NeuroD1 binds directly to the G6PD promoter to activate G6PD transcription. Consequently, tumor cell proliferation and colony formation are enhanced, leading to increased tumorigenic potential in vitro and in vivo. These findings reveal a novel function of NeuroD1 as a regulator of G6PD, whereby its oncogenic activity is linked to tumor cell metabolic reprogramming and regulation of the PPP. Furthermore, NeuroD1 represents a potential target for metabolism-based anti-tumor therapeutic strategies.

34818536	Glucose metabolism modulates the islet beta cell responses to diabetogenic stress, including inflammation. Here, we probed the metabolic mechanisms that underlie the protective effect of glucose in inflammation by interrogating the metabolite profiles of primary islets from human donors and identified de novo glutathione synthesis as a prominent glucose-driven pro-survival pathway. We find that pyruvate carboxylase is required for glutathione synthesis in islets and promotes their antioxidant capacity to counter inflammation and nitrosative stress. Loss- and gain-of-function studies indicate that pyruvate carboxylase is necessary and sufficient to mediate the metabolic input from glucose into glutathione synthesis and the oxidative stress response. Altered redox metabolism and cellular capacity to replenish glutathione pools are relevant in multiple pathologies beyond obesity and diabetes. Our findings reveal a direct interplay between glucose metabolism and glutathione biosynthesis via pyruvate carboxylase. This metabolic axis may also have implications in other settings where sustaining glutathione is essential.

35038453	RNA interference by type III CRISPR systems results in the synthesis of cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) second messengers, which are known to bind and regulate various CARF domain-containing nuclease receptors. The CARF domain-containing Csa3 family of transcriptional factors associated with the DNA-targeting type I CRISPR systems regulate expression of various CRISPR and DNA repair genes in many prokaryotes. In this study, we extend the known receptor repertoire of cOA messengers to include transcriptional factors by demonstrating specific binding of cyclic tetra-adenylate (cA4) to Saccharolobus solfataricus Csa3 (Csa3Sso). Our 2.0-A resolution X-ray crystal structure of cA4-bound full-length Csa3Sso reveals the binding of its CARF domain to an elongated conformation of cA4. Using cA4 binding affinity analyses of Csa3Sso mutants targeting the observed Csa3Sso*cA4 structural interface, we identified a Csa3-specific cA4 binding motif distinct from a more widely conserved cOA-binding CARF motif. Using a rational surface engineering approach, we increased the cA4 binding affinity of Csa3Sso up to approximately 145-fold over the wildtype, which has potential applications for future second messenger-driven CRISPR gene expression and editing systems. Our in-solution Csa3Sso structural analysis identified cA4-induced allosteric and asymmetric conformational rearrangement of its C-terminal winged helix-turn-helix effector domains, which could potentially be incompatible to DNA binding. However, specific in vitro binding of the purified Csa3Sso to its putative promoter (PCas4a) was found to be cA4 independent, suggesting a complex mode of Csa3Sso regulation. Overall, our results support cA4-and Csa3-mediated cross talk between type III and type I CRISPR systems.

34958799	Copper (Cu) is essential for all life forms; however, in excess, it becomes toxic. Toxic properties of Cu are known to be utilized by host species against various pathogenic invasions. Leishmania, in both free-living and intracellular forms, exhibits appreciable tolerance toward Cu stress. While determining the mechanism of Cu-stress evasion employed by Leishmania, we identified and characterized a hitherto unknown Cu-ATPase in Leishmania major and established its role in parasite survival in host macrophages. This novel L. major Cu-ATPase, LmATP7, exhibits homology with its orthologs at multiple motifs. In promastigotes, LmATP7 primarily localized at the plasma membrane. We also show that LmATP7 exhibits Cu-dependent expression patterns and complements Cu transport in a Cu-ATPase-deficient yeast strain. Promastigotes overexpressing LmATP7 exhibited higher survival upon Cu stress, indicating efficacious Cu export compared with Wt and heterozygous LmATP7 knockout parasites. We further explored macrophage-Leishmania interactions with respect to Cu stress. We found that Leishmania infection triggers upregulation of major mammalian Cu exporter, ATP7A, in macrophages, and trafficking of ATP7A from the trans-Golgi network to endolysosomes in macrophages harboring amastigotes. Simultaneously, in Leishmania, we observed a multifold increase in LmATP7 transcripts as the promastigote becomes established in macrophages and morphs to the amastigote form. Finally, overexpressing LmATP7 in parasites increases amastigote survivability within macrophages, whereas knocking it down reduces survivability drastically. Mice injected in their footpads with an LmATP7-overexpressing strain showed significantly larger lesions and higher amastigote loads as compared with controls and knockouts. These data establish the role of LmATP7 in parasite infectivity and intramacrophagic survivability.

34799661	Emerging evidence shows the association between nuclear envelope and tumor progression, however, the functional contributions of specific constituents of the nuclear envelope remain largely unclear. We found that the expression level of transmembrane protein 201 (TMEM201), an integral inner nuclear membrane protein of unknown function, was significantly elevated in invasive breast cancer and predicted poor breast cancer prognosis. We showed that TMEM201, as a positive modulator, was both necessary and sufficient to regulate the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, RNA-sequencing analysis and validation showed that TMEM201 deficiency inhibited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and transforming growth factor-beta signaling. Finally, we showed that TMEM201 physically interacted with SMAD2/3 and was required for the phosphorylation of SMAD2/3, nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of the TGFbeta. Thus, we demonstrated that specific inner nuclear membrane component mediated signal-dependent transcriptional effects to control breast cancer metastasis.

34433066	Primary sigma(70) factors are key conserved bacterial regulatory proteins that interact with regulatory DNA to control gene expression. It is, however, poorly understood whether sigma(70) sequence diversity in different bacteria reflects functional differences. Here, we employ comparative and functional genomics to explore the sequence and function relationship of primary sigma(70). Using multiplex automated genome engineering and deep sequencing (MAGE-seq), we generate a saturation mutagenesis library and high-resolution fitness map of E. coli sigma(70) in domains 2-4. Mapping natural sigma(70) sequence diversity to the E. coli sigma(70) fitness landscape reveals significant predicted fitness deficits across sigma(70) orthologs. Interestingly, these predicted deficits are larger than observed fitness changes for 15 sigma(70) orthologs introduced into E. coli. Finally, we use a multiplexed transcriptional reporter assay and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to explore functional differences of several sigma(70) orthologs.

34912054	Cell death pathways have evolved to maintain tissue homoeostasis and eliminate potentially harmful cells from within an organism, such as cells with damaged DNA that could lead to cancer. Apoptosis, known to eliminate cells in a predominantly non-inflammatory manner, is controlled by two main branches, the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. While the intrinsic pathway is regulated by the Bcl-2 family members, the extrinsic pathway is controlled by the Death receptors, members of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily. Death receptors can also activate a pro-inflammatory type of cell death, necroptosis, when Caspase-8 is inhibited. Apoptotic pathways are known to be tightly regulated by post-translational modifications, especially by ubiquitination.

34592149	The evolutionarily conserved ULK1 kinase complex acts as gatekeeper of canonical autophagy and regulates induction of autophagosome biogenesis. To better understand control of ULK1 and analyze whether ULK1 has broader functions that are also linked to the later steps of autophagy, we perform comprehensive phosphoproteomic analyses. Combining in vivo with in vitro data, we identify numerous direct ULK1 target sites within autophagy-relevant proteins that are critical for autophagosome maturation and turnover. In addition, we highlight an intimate crosstalk between ULK1 and several phosphatase complexes. ULK1 is not only a PP2A target but also directly phosphorylates the regulatory PP2A subunit striatin, activating PP2A and serving as positive feedback to promote autophagy-dependent protein turnover.

34433038	Malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs) represent one of the most aggressive childhood malignancies. No effective treatment options are available, and prognosis is, therefore, dismal. Previous studies have demonstrated that tumor organoids capture the heterogeneity of patient tumors and can be used to predict patient response to therapy. Here, we perform drug screening on patient-derived normal and tumor organoids to identify MRT-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. We identify neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 as a potential therapeutic agent. Mechanistically, we find increased neddylation in MRT organoids and tissues and show that MLN4924 induces a cytotoxic response via upregulation of the unfolded protein response. Lastly, we demonstrate in vivo efficacy in an MRT PDX mouse model, in which single-agent MLN4924 treatment significantly extends survival. Our study demonstrates that organoids can be used to find drugs selectively targeting tumor cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed and proposes neddylation inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in MRT.

34644563	Patients with activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase delta (PI3Kdelta) syndrome (APDS) present with sinopulmonary infections, lymphadenopathy, and cytomegalvirus (CMV) and/or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia, yet why patients fail to clear certain chronic viral infections remains incompletely understood. Using patient samples and a mouse model (Pik3cd(E1020K/+) mice), we demonstrate that, upon activation, Pik3cd(E1020K/+) CD8(+) T cells exhibit exaggerated features of effector populations both in vitro and after viral infection that are associated with increased Fas-mediated apoptosis due to sustained FoxO1 phosphorylation and Fasl derepression, enhanced mTORC1 and c-Myc signatures, metabolic perturbations, and an altered chromatin landscape. Conversely, Pik3cd(E1020K/+) CD8(+) cells fail to sustain expression of proteins critical for central memory, including TCF1. Strikingly, activated Pik3cd(E1020K/+) CD8(+) cells exhibit altered transcriptional and epigenetic circuits characterized by pronounced interleukin-2 (IL-2)/STAT5 signatures and heightened IL-2 responses that prevent differentiation to memory-like cells in IL-15. Our data position PI3Kdelta as integrating multiple signaling nodes that promote CD8(+) T cell effector differentiation, providing insight into phenotypes of patients with APDS.	PI3Kdelta coordinates transcriptional, chromatin, and metabolic changes to promote effector CD8(+) T cells at the expense of central memory.	Cell reports	2.0	0

34758300	Regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical for immunological tolerance and immune homeostasis. Treg cells strongly rely on mitochondrial metabolism and show a lower level of glycolysis. However, little is known about the role of lipid metabolism in the regulation of Treg cell homeostasis. Some members of the ACSL family of acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthases are expressed in T cells, but their function remains unclear. A combination of RNA-sequencing and proteome analyses shows that Acsbg1, a member of ACSL, is selectively expressed in Treg cells. We show that the genetic deletion of Acsbg1 not only causes mitochondrial dysfunction, but it also dampens other metabolic pathways. The extrinsic supplementation of Acsbg1-deficient Treg cells with oleoyl-CoA restores the phenotype of the Treg metabolic signature. Furthermore, this pathway in ST2(+) effector Treg cells enhances immunosuppressive capacity in airway inflammation. Thus, Acsbg1 serves as a metabolic checkpoint governing Treg cell homeostasis and the resolution of lung inflammation.

34890645	Phosphatases of regenerating liver (PRLs) are protein phosphatases involved in the control of cell growth and migration. They are known to promote cancer metastasis but, despite over 20 years of study, there is still no consensus about their mechanism of action. Recent work has revealed that PRLs lead double lives, acting both as catalytically active enzymes and as pseudophosphatases. The three known PRLs belong to the large family of cysteine phosphatases that form a phosphocysteine intermediate during catalysis. Uniquely to PRLs, this intermediate is stable, with a lifetime measured in hours. As a consequence, PRLs have very little phosphatase activity. Independently, PRLs also act as pseudophosphatases by binding CNNM membrane proteins to regulate magnesium homeostasis. In this function, an aspartic acid from CNNM inserts into the phosphatase catalytic site of PRLs, mimicking a substrate-enzyme interaction. The delineation of PRL pseudophosphatase and phosphatase activities in vivo was impossible until the recent identification of PRL mutants defective in one activity or the other. These mutants showed that CNNM binding was sufficient for PRL oncogenicity in one model of metastasis, but left unresolved its role in other contexts. As the presence of phosphocysteine prevents CNNM binding and CNNM-binding blocks catalytic activity, these two activities are inherently linked. Additional studies are needed to untangle the intertwined catalytic and noncatalytic functions of PRLs. Here, we review the current understanding of the structure and biophysical properties of PRL phosphatases.

34896391	"We report that intra-islet glucagon secreted from alpha-cells signals through beta-cell glucagon and GLP-1 receptors (GcgR and GLP-1R), thereby conferring to rat islets their competence to exhibit first-phase glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Thus, in islets not treated with exogenous glucagon or GLP-1, first-phase GSIS is abolished by a GcgR antagonist (LY2786890) or a GLP-1R antagonist (Ex[9-39]). Mechanistically, glucose competence in response to intra-islet glucagon is conditional on beta-cell cAMP signaling because it is blocked by the cAMP antagonist prodrug Rp-8-Br-cAMPS-pAB. In its role as a paracrine hormone, intra-islet glucagon binds with high affinity to the GcgR, while also exerting a ""spillover"" effect to bind with low affinity to the GLP-1R. This produces a right shift of the concentration-response relationship for the potentiation of GSIS by exogenous glucagon. Thus, 0.3 nM glucagon fails to potentiate GSIS, as expected if similar concentrations of intra-islet glucagon already occupy the GcgR. However, 10 to 30 nM glucagon effectively engages the beta-cell GLP-1R to potentiate GSIS, an action blocked by Ex[9-39] but not LY2786890. Finally, we report that the action of intra-islet glucagon to support insulin secretion requires a step-wise increase of glucose concentration to trigger first-phase GSIS. It is not measurable when GSIS is stimulated by a gradient of increasing glucose concentrations, as occurs during an oral glucose tolerance test in vivo. Collectively, such findings are understandable if defective intra-islet glucagon action contributes to the characteristic loss of first-phase GSIS in an intravenous glucose tolerance test that is diagnostic of type 2 diabetes in the clinical setting."

35016033	Citrulline can be converted into argininosuccinate by argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1) in the urea cycle and the citrulline-nitric oxide cycle. However, the regulation and biological function of citrulline metabolism remain obscure in the immune system. Unexpectedly, we found that macrophage citrulline declines rapidly after interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and/or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, which is required for efficient proinflammatory signaling activation. Mechanistically, IFN-gamma and/or LPS stimulation promotes signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1)-mediated ASS1 transcription and Janus kinase2 (JAK2)-mediated phosphorylation of ASS1 at tyrosine 87, thereby leading to citrulline depletion. Reciprocally, increased citrulline directly binds to JAK2 and inhibits JAK2-STAT1 signaling. Blockage of ASS1-mediated citrulline depletion suppresses the host defense against bacterial infection in vivo. We therefore define a central role for ASS1 in controlling inflammatory macrophage activation and antibacterial defense through depletion of cellular citrulline and, further, identify citrulline as an innate immune-signaling metabolite that engages a metabolic checkpoint for proinflammatory responses.	Citrulline depletion by ASS1 is required for proinflammatory macrophage activation and immune responses.	Molecular cell	4.0	1
34433022	Tumor genotype can influence the immune microenvironment, which plays a critical role in cancer development and therapy resistance. However, the immune effects of gain-of-function Trp53 mutations have not been defined in pancreatic cancer. We compare the immune profiles generated by Kras(G12D)-mutated mouse pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (PDECs) engineered genetically to express the Trp53(R172H) mutation with their p53 wild-type control. Kras(G12D/+);Trp53(R172H/+) tumors have a distinct immune profile characterized by an influx of CD11b(+)Ly6G(+) neutrophils and concomitant decreases in CD3(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, and CD4(+) T helper 1 cells. Knockdown of CXCL2, a neutrophil chemokine, in the tumor epithelial compartment of CRISPR Kras(G12D/+;)Trp53(R172H/+) PDEC tumors reverses the neutrophil phenotype. Neutrophil depletion of mice bearing CRISPR Kras(G12D/+);Trp53(R172H/+) tumors augments sensitivity to combined CD40 immunotherapy and chemotherapy. These data link Trp53(R172H) to the presence of intratumoral neutrophils in pancreatic cancer and suggest that tumor genotypes could inform selection of affected individuals for immunotherapy.

34802034	Nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins is disrupted and dysregulated in cancer cells. Nuclear pore complexes and cargo proteins are two main transportation regulators. However, the mechanism regulating nucleocytoplasmic transport in cancer remains elusive. Here, we identified a S100A2/KPNA2 cotransport complex that transports the tumor-associated transcription factor NFYA in colorectal cancer (CRC). Through the S100A2/KNPA2 complex, depending on its interaction with S100A2, NFYA is transported to the nucleus and inhibits the transcriptional activity of E-cadherin, which in turn promotes CRC metastasis. Targeting the S100A2/KPNA2 binding sites with the specific inhibitor delanzomib is a potential therapeutic approach for CRC.	The interaction between S100A2 and KPNA2 mediates NFYA nuclear import and is a novel therapeutic target for colorectal cancer metastasis.	Oncogene	3.0	1
34852224	Intraluminal lymphatic valves (LVs) contribute to the prevention of lymph backflow and maintain circulatory homeostasis. Several reports have investigated the molecular mechanisms which promote LV formation; however, the way in which they are suppressed is not completely clear. We show that the forkhead transcription factor FOXO1 is a suppressor of LV formation and maintenance in lymphatic endothelial cells. Oscillatory shear stress by bidirectional flow inactivates FOXO1 via Akt phosphorylation, resulting in the upregulation of a subset of LV-specific genes mediated by downregulation of a transcriptional repressor, PRDM1. Mice with an endothelial-specific Foxo1 deletion have an increase in LVs, and overexpression of Foxo1 in mice produces a decrease in LVs. Genetic reduction of PRDM1 rescues the decrease in LV by Foxo1 overexpression. In conclusion, FOXO1 plays a critical role in lymph flow homeostasis by preventing excess LV formation. This gene might be a therapeutic target for lymphatic circulatory abnormalities.	FOXO1 represses lymphatic valve formation and maintenance via PRDM1.	Cell reports	3.0	1
34965438	Lipid storage in fat tissue is important for energy homeostasis and cellular functions. Through RNAi screening in Drosophila fat body, we found that knockdown of a Drosophila NAD kinase (NADK), which phosphorylates NAD to synthesize NADP de novo, causes lipid storage defects. NADK sustains lipogenesis by maintaining the pool of NADPH. Promoting NADPH production rescues the lipid storage defect in the fat body of NADK RNAi animals. Furthermore, NADK and fatty acid synthase 1 (FASN1) regulate mitochondrial mass and function by altering the levels of acetyl-CoA and fatty acids. Reducing the level of acetyl-CoA or increasing the synthesis of cardiolipin (CL), a mitochondrion-specific phospholipid, partially rescues the mitochondrial defects of NADK RNAi. Therefore, NADK- and FASN1-mediated fatty acid synthesis coordinates lipid storage and mitochondrial function.

34879276	Ongoing inchworm-like CAG and CGG repeat expansions in brains, arising by aberrant processing of slipped DNAs, may drive Huntington's disease, fragile X syndrome, and autism. FAN1 nuclease modifies hyper-expansion rates by unknown means. We show that FAN1, through iterative cycles, binds, dimerizes, and cleaves slipped DNAs, yielding striking exo-nuclease pauses along slip-outs: 5'-C downward arrowA downward arrowGC downward arrowA downward arrowG-3' and 5'-C downward arrowT downward arrowG downward arrowC downward arrowT downward arrowG-3'. CAG excision is slower than CTG and requires intra-strand A.A and T.T mismatches. Fully paired hairpins arrested excision, whereas disease-delaying CAA interruptions further slowed excision. Endo-nucleolytic cleavage is insensitive to slip-outs. Rare FAN1 variants are found in individuals with autism with CGG/CCG expansions, and CGG/CCG slip-outs show exo-nuclease pauses. The slip-out-specific ligand, naphthyridine-azaquinolone, which induces contractions of expanded repeats in vivo, requires FAN1 for its effect, and protects slip-outs from FAN1 exo-, but not endo-, nucleolytic digestion. FAN1's inchworm pausing of slip-out excision rates is well suited to modify inchworm expansion rates, which modify disease onset and progression.

34496241	Clostridioides difficile is the leading cause of nosocomial intestinal infections in the United States. Ingested C. difficile spores encounter host bile acids and other cues that are necessary for germinating into toxin-producing vegetative cells. While gut microbiota disruption (often by antibiotics) is a prerequisite for C. difficile infection (CDI), the mechanisms C. difficile employs for colonization remain unclear. Here, we pioneered the application of imaging mass spectrometry to study how enteric infection changes gut metabolites. We find that CDI induces an influx of bile acids into the gut within 24 h of the host ingesting spores. In response, the host reduces bile acid biosynthesis gene expression. These bile acids drive C. difficile outgrowth, as mice receiving the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine display delayed colonization and reduced germination. Our findings indicate that C. difficile may facilitate germination upon infection and suggest that altering flux through bile acid pathways can modulate C. difficile outgrowth in CDI-prone patients.

34779857	Visceral adipose tissue shows remarkable plasticity, constantly replacing mature adipocytes from an inherent pool of adipocyte precursors. The number of precursors is set in the juvenile organism and remains constant in adult life. Which signals drive precursor pool expansion in juveniles and why they operate in visceral but not in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) are unclear. Using mouse models, we identified the insulin-sensitizing receptor SORLA as a molecular factor explaining the distinct proliferative capacity of visceral WAT. High levels of SORLA activity in precursors of juvenile visceral WAT prime these cells for nutritional stimuli provided through insulin, promoting mitotic expansion of the visceral precursor cell pool in overfed juvenile mice. SORLA activity is low in subcutaneous precursors, blunting their response to insulin and preventing diet-induced proliferation of this cell type. Our findings provide a molecular explanation for the unique proliferative properties of juvenile visceral WAT, and for the genetic association of SORLA with visceral obesity in humans.	SORLA is required for insulin-induced expansion of the adipocyte precursor pool in visceral fat.	The Journal of cell biology	0.0	0
34525372	Chromatin organization plays a crucial role in tissue homeostasis. Heterochromatin relaxation and consequent unscheduled mobilization of transposable elements (TEs) are emerging as key contributors of aging and aging-related pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cancer. However, the mechanisms governing heterochromatin maintenance or its relaxation in pathological conditions remain poorly understood. Here we show that PIN1, the only phosphorylation-specific cis/trans prolyl isomerase, whose loss is associated with premature aging and AD, is essential to preserve heterochromatin. We demonstrate that this PIN1 function is conserved from Drosophila to humans and prevents TE mobilization-dependent neurodegeneration and cognitive defects. Mechanistically, PIN1 maintains nuclear type-B Lamin structure and anchoring function for heterochromatin protein 1alpha (HP1alpha). This mechanism prevents nuclear envelope alterations and heterochromatin relaxation under mechanical stress, which is a key contributor to aging-related pathologies.	The prolyl-isomerase PIN1 is essential for nuclear Lamin-B structure and function and protects heterochromatin under mechanical stress.	Cell reports	2.0	0
35007532	Although diabetes normally causes an elevation of cholesterol biosynthesis and induces hypercholesterolemia in animals and human, the mechanism linking diabetes to the dysregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver is not fully understood. As liver peroxisomal beta-oxidation is induced in the diabetic state and peroxisomal oxidation of fatty acids generates free acetate, we hypothesized that peroxisomal beta-oxidation might play a role in liver cholesterol biosynthesis in diabetes. Here, we used erucic acid, a specific substrate for peroxisomal beta-oxidation, and 10,12-tricosadiynoic acid, a specific inhibitor for peroxisomal beta-oxidation, to specifically induce and suppress peroxisomal beta-oxidation. Our results suggested that induction of peroxisomal beta-oxidation increased liver cholesterol biosynthesis in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. We found that excessive oxidation of fatty acids by peroxisomes generated considerable free acetate in the liver, which was used as a precursor for cholesterol biosynthesis. In addition, we show that specific inhibition of peroxisomal beta-oxidation decreased cholesterol biosynthesis by reducing acetate formation in the liver in diabetic mice, demonstrating a crosstalk between peroxisomal beta-oxidation and cholesterol biosynthesis. Based on these results, we propose that induction of peroxisomal beta-oxidation serves as a mechanism for a fatty acid-induced upregulation in cholesterol biosynthesis and also plays a role in diabetes-induced hypercholesterolemia.	Peroxisomal beta-oxidation stimulates cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver in diabetic mice.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0.0	0
34973339	Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) is a vertebrate protein, normally found within the presynaptic nerve terminal and nucleus, which is known to form somatic and neuritic aggregates in certain neurodegenerative diseases. Disease-associated aggregates of aSyn are heavily phosphorylated at serine-129 (pSyn), while normal aSyn protein is not. Within the nucleus, aSyn can directly bind DNA, but the mechanism of binding and the potential modulatory roles of phosphorylation are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate using a combination of electrophoretic mobility shift assay and atomic force microscopy approaches that both aSyn and pSyn can bind DNA within the major groove, in a DNA length-dependent manner and with little specificity for DNA sequence. Our data are consistent with a model in which multiple aSyn molecules bind a single 300 base pair (bp) DNA molecule in such a way that stabilizes the DNA in a bent conformation. We propose that serine-129 phosphorylation decreases the ability of aSyn to both bind and bend DNA, as aSyn binds 304 bp circular DNA forced into a bent shape, but pSyn does not. Two aSyn paralogs, beta- and gamma-synuclein, also interact with DNA differently than aSyn, and do not stabilize similar DNA conformations. Our work suggests that reductions in aSyn's ability to bind and bend DNA induced by serine-129 phosphorylation may be important for modulating aSyn's known roles in DNA metabolism, including the regulation of transcription and DNA repair.

34496247	Although the roles of initiation factors, RNA binding proteins, and RNA elements in regulating translation are well defined, how the ribosome functionally diversifies remains poorly understood. In their human hosts, poxviruses phosphorylate serine 278 (S(278)) at the tip of a loop domain in the small subunit ribosomal protein RACK1, thereby mimicking negatively charged residues in the RACK1 loops of dicot plants and protists to stimulate translation of transcripts with 5' poly(A) leaders. However, how a negatively charged RACK1 loop affects ribosome structure and its broader translational output is not known. Here, we show that although ribotoxin-induced stress signaling and stalling on poly(A) sequences are unaffected, negative charge in the RACK1 loop alters the swivel motion of the 40S head domain in a manner similar to several internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), confers resistance to various protein synthesis inhibitors, and broadly supports noncanonical modes of translation.	Negative charge in the RACK1 loop broadens the translational capacity of the human ribosome.	Cell reports	0.0	0
34758190	The heterochromatin protein HP1 plays a central role in the maintenance of genome stability but little is known about how HP1 is controlled. Here, we show that the zinc finger protein POGZ promotes the presence of HP1 at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human cells. POGZ depletion delays the resolution of DSBs and sensitizes cells to different DNA-damaging agents, including cisplatin and talazoparib. Mechanistically, POGZ promotes homology-directed DNA repair by retaining the BRCA1/BARD1 complex at DSBs in an HP1-dependent manner. In vivo CRISPR inactivation of Pogz is embryonically lethal. Pogz haploinsufficiency (Pogz(+) /delta) results in developmental delay, impaired intellectual abilities, hyperactive behaviour and a compromised humoral immune response in mice, recapitulating the main clinical features of the White Sutton syndrome (WHSUS). Pogz(+) /delta mice are further radiosensitive and accumulate DSBs in diverse tissues, including the spleen and brain. Altogether, our findings identify POGZ as an important player in homology-directed DNA repair both in vitro and in vivo.	POGZ promotes homology-directed DNA repair in an HP1-dependent manner.

34758299	Memory T cells exhibit considerable diversity that determines their ability to be protective. Here, we examine whether changes in T cell heterogeneity contribute to the age-associated failure of immune memory. By screening for age-dependent T cell-surface markers, we identify CD4 and CD8 memory T cell subsets that are unrelated to previously defined subsets of central and effector memory cells. Memory T cells expressing the ecto-5'-nucleotidase CD73 constitute a functionally distinct subset of memory T cells that declines with age. They resemble long-lived, polyfunctional memory cells but are also poised to display effector functions and to develop into cells resembling tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs). Upstream regulators of differential chromatin accessibility and transcriptomes include transcription factors that facilitate CD73 expression and regulate TRM differentiation. CD73 is not just a surrogate marker of these regulatory networks but is directly involved in T cell survival.

34637755	Methods derived from CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag enable genome-wide mapping of the localization of proteins on chromatin from as few as one cell. These and other mapping approaches focus on one protein at a time, preventing direct measurements of co-localization of different chromatin proteins in the same cells and requiring prioritization of targets where samples are limiting. Here, we describe multi-CUT&Tag, an adaptation of CUT&Tag that overcomes these hurdles by using antibody-specific barcodes to simultaneously map multiple proteins in the same cells. Highly specific multi-CUT&Tag maps of histone marks and RNA Polymerase II uncovered sites of co-localization in the same cells, active and repressed genes, and candidate cis-regulatory elements. Single-cell multi-CUT&Tag profiling facilitated identification of distinct cell types from a mixed population and characterization of cell-type-specific chromatin architecture. In sum, multi-CUT&Tag increases the information content per cell of epigenomic maps, facilitating direct analysis of the interplay of different chromatin proteins.

34469720	B cell clones compete for entry into and dominance within germinal centers (GCs), where the highest-affinity B cell receptors (BCRs) are selected. However, diverse and low-affinity B cells can enter and reside in GCs for extended periods. To reconcile these observations, we hypothesize that a negative feedback loop may operate within B cells to preferentially restrain high-affinity clones from monopolizing the early GC niche. Here, we report a role for the nuclear receptor NUR77/Nr4a1 in this process. We show that NUR77 expression scales with antigen stimulation and restrains B cell expansion. Although NUR77 is dispensable for regulating GC size when GCs are elicited in a largely clonal manner, it serves to curb immunodominance under conditions where diverse clonal populations must compete for a constrained niche. We propose that this is important to preserve early clonal diversity in order to limit holes in the post-immune repertoire and to optimize GC selection.

In a recent issue, Tooley et al. demonstrated that TBK1-dependent activation of downstream kinase Akt is mediated via mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2.

34752143	Neonatal seizures pose a clinical challenge in their early detection, acute management, and long-term comorbidities. They are often caused by hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and are frequently refractory to the first-line antiseizure medication phenobarbital. One proposed mechanism for phenobarbital inefficacy during neonatal seizures is the reduced abundance and function of the neuron-specific K(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter 2 (KCC2), which maintains chloride homeostasis and promotes GABAergic inhibition upon its phosphorylation during postnatal development. Here, we investigated whether this mechanism is causal and whether it can be rescued by KCC2 functional enhancement. In a CD-1 mouse model of refractory ischemic neonatal seizures, treatment with the KCC2 functional enhancer CLP290 rescued phenobarbital efficacy, increased KCC2 abundance, and prevented the development of epileptogenesis, as quantified by video electroencephalogram monitoring. These effects were prevented by knock-in expression of nonphosphorylatable mutants of KCC2 (S940A or T906A and T1007A), indicating that KCC2 phosphorylation regulates both neonatal seizure susceptibility and CLP290-mediated KCC2 functional enhancement. Our findings therefore validate KCC2 as a clinically relevant target for refractory neonatal seizures and provide insights for future drug development.

34793837	SARM1 is a toll/interleukin-1 receptor -domain containing protein, with roles proposed in both innate immunity and neuronal degeneration. Murine SARM1 has been reported to regulate the transcription of chemokines in both neurons and macrophages; however, the extent to which SARM1 contributes to transcription regulation remains to be fully understood. Here, we identify differential gene expression in bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from C57BL/6 congenic 129 ES cell-derived Sarm1(-/-) mice compared with wild type (WT). However, we found that passenger genes, which are derived from the 129 donor strain of mice that flank the Sarm1 locus, confound interpretation of the results, since many of the identified differentially regulated genes come from this region. To re-examine the transcriptional role of SARM1 in the absence of passenger genes, here we generated three Sarm1(-/-) mice using CRISPR/Cas9. Treatment of neurons from these mice with vincristine, a chemotherapeutic drug causing axonal degeneration, confirmed SARM1's function in that process; however, these mice also showed that lack of SARM1 has no impact on transcription of genes previously shown to be affected such as chemokines. To gain further insight into SARM1 function, we generated an epitope-tagged SARM1 mouse. In these mice, we observed high SARM1 protein expression in the brain and brainstem and lower but detectable levels in macrophages. Overall, the generation of these SARM1 knockout and epitope-tagged mice has clarified that SARM1 is expressed in mouse macrophages yet has no general role in macrophage transcriptional regulation and has provided important new models to further explore SARM1 function.

34979097	Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are able to undergo both self-renewal and differentiation. Unlike self-renewal, which replenishes the SSC and progenitor pool, differentiation is an irreversible process committing cells to meiosis. Although the preparations for meiotic events in differentiating spermatogonia (Di-SG) are likely to be accompanied by alterations in chromatin structure, the three-dimensional chromatin architectural differences between SSCs and Di-SG, and the higher-order chromatin dynamics during spermatogonial differentiation, have not been systematically investigated. Here, we performed in situ high-throughput chromosome conformation capture, RNA-seq, and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analyses on porcine undifferentiated spermatogonia (which consist of SSCs and progenitors) and Di-SG. We identified that Di-SG exhibited less compact chromatin structural organization, weakened compartmentalization, and diminished topologically associating domains in comparison with undifferentiated spermatogonia, suggesting that diminished higher-order chromatin architecture in meiotic cells, as shown by recent reports, might be preprogrammed in Di-SG. Our data also revealed that A/B compartments, representing open or closed chromatin regions respectively, and topologically associating domains were related to dynamic gene expression during spermatogonial differentiation. Furthermore, we unraveled the contribution of promoter-enhancer interactions to premeiotic transcriptional regulation, which has not been accomplished in previous studies due to limited cell input and resolution. Together, our study uncovered the three-dimensional chromatin structure of SSCs/progenitors and Di-SG, as well as the interplay between higher-order chromatin architecture and dynamic gene expression during spermatogonial differentiation. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms for SSC self-renewal and differentiation and have implications for diagnosis and treatment of male sub-/infertility.

34686333	WNTs play key roles in development and disease, signaling through Frizzled (FZD) seven-pass transmembrane receptors and numerous co-receptors including ROR and RYK family receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). We describe crystal structures and WNT-binding characteristics of extracellular regions from the Drosophila ROR and RYK orthologs Nrk (neurospecific receptor tyrosine kinase) and Derailed-2 (Drl-2), which bind WNTs though a FZD-related cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and WNT-inhibitory factor (WIF) domain respectively. Our crystal structures suggest that neither Nrk nor Drl-2 can accommodate the acyl chain typically attached to WNTs. The Nrk CRD contains a deeply buried bound fatty acid, unlikely to be exchangeable. The Drl-2 WIF domain lacks the lipid-binding site seen in WIF-1. We also find that recombinant DWnt-5 can bind Drosophila ROR and RYK orthologs despite lacking an acyl chain. Alongside analyses of WNT/receptor interaction sites, our structures provide further insight into how WNTs may recruit RTK co-receptors into signaling complexes.

34942146	Understanding the core replication complex of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential to the development of novel coronavirus-specific antiviral therapeutics. Among the proteins required for faithful replication of the SARS-CoV-2 genome are nonstructural protein 14 (NSP14), a bifunctional enzyme with an N-terminal 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) and a C-terminal N7-methyltransferase, and its accessory protein, NSP10. The difficulty in producing pure and high quantities of the NSP10/14 complex has hampered the biochemical and structural study of these important proteins. We developed a straightforward protocol for the expression and purification of both NSP10 and NSP14 from Escherichia coli and for the in vitro assembly and purification of a stoichiometric NSP10/14 complex with high yields. Using these methods, we observe that NSP10 provides a 260-fold increase in kcat/Km in the exoribonucleolytic activity of NSP14 and enhances protein stability. We also probed the effect of two small molecules on NSP10/14 activity, remdesivir monophosphate and the methyltransferase inhibitor S-adenosylhomocysteine. Our analysis highlights two important factors for drug development: first, unlike other exonucleases, the monophosphate nucleoside analog intermediate of remdesivir does not inhibit NSP14 activity; and second, S-adenosylhomocysteine modestly activates NSP14 exonuclease activity. In total, our analysis provides insights for future structure-function studies of SARS-CoV-2 replication fidelity for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019.

34675409	Aberrant protein glycosylation has been shown to have a significant contribution in aggressive cancer, including pancreatic cancer (PC). Emerging evidence has implicated the involvement of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in PC aggressiveness; however, the contribution of glycosylation on self-renewal properties and maintenance of CSC is understudied. Here, using several in vitro and in vivo models lacking C1GALT1 expression, we identified the role of aberrant O-glycosylation in stemness properties and aggressive PC metastasis. A loss in C1GALT1 was found to result in the truncation of O-glycosylation on several glycoproteins with an enrichment of Tn carbohydrate antigen. Mapping of Tn-bearing glycoproteins in C1GALT1 KO cells identified significant Tn enrichment on CSC glycoprotein CD44. Notably, a loss of C1GALT1 in PC cells was found to enhance CSC features (side population-SP, ALDH1+, and tumorspheres) and self-renewal markers NANOG, SOX9, and KLF4. Furthermore, a loss of CD44 in existing C1GALT1 KO cells decreased NANOG expression and CSC features. We determined that O-glycosylation of CD44 activates ERK/NF-kB signaling, which results in increased NANOG expression in PC cells that facilitated the alteration of CSC features, suggesting that NANOG is essential for PC stemness. Finally, we identified that loss of C1GALT1 expression was found to augment tumorigenic and metastatic potential, while an additional loss of CD44 in these cells reversed the effects. Overall, our results identified that truncation of O-glycans on CD44 increases NANOG activation that mediates increased CSC activation.

34773075	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) serve as critical signals in various cellular processes. Excessive ROS cause cell death or senescence and mediates the therapeutic effect of many cancer drugs. Recent studies showed that ROS increasingly accumulate during G2/M arrest, the underlying mechanism, however, has not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that in cancer cells treated with anticancer agent TH287 or paclitaxel that causes M arrest, mitochondria accumulate robustly and produce excessive mitochondrial superoxide, which causes oxidative DNA damage and undermines cell survival and proliferation. While mitochondrial mass is greatly increased in cells arrested at M phase, the mitochondrial function is compromised, as reflected by reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, increased SUMOylation and acetylation of mitochondrial proteins, as well as an increased metabolic reliance on glycolysis. CHK1 functional disruption decelerates cell cycle, spares the M arrest and attenuates mitochondrial oxidative stress. Induction of mitophagy and blockade of mitochondrial biogenesis, measures that reduce mitochondrial accumulation, also decelerate cell cycle and abrogate M arrest-coupled mitochondrial oxidative stress. These results suggest that cell cycle progression and mitochondrial homeostasis are interdependent and coordinated, and that impairment of mitochondrial homeostasis and the associated redox signaling may mediate the antineoplastic effect of the M arrest-inducing chemotherapeutics. Our findings provide insights into the fate of cells arrested at M phase and have implications in cancer therapy.

34935867	"Cancer patients frequently develop chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), a painful and long-lasting disorder with profound somatosensory deficits. There are no effective therapies to prevent or treat this disorder. Pathologically, CIPN is characterized by a ""dying-back"" axonopathy that begins at intra-epidermal nerve terminals of sensory neurons and progresses in a retrograde fashion. Calcium dysregulation constitutes a critical event in CIPN, but it is not known how chemotherapies such as paclitaxel alter intra-axonal calcium and cause degeneration. Here, we demonstrate that paclitaxel triggers Sarm1-dependent cADPR production in distal axons, promoting intra-axonal calcium flux from both intracellular and extracellular calcium stores. Genetic or pharmacologic antagonists of cADPR signaling prevent paclitaxel-induced axon degeneration and allodynia symptoms, without mitigating the anti-neoplastic efficacy of paclitaxel. Our data demonstrate that cADPR is a calcium-modulating factor that promotes paclitaxel-induced axon degeneration and suggest that targeting cADPR signaling provides a potential therapeutic approach for treating paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN)."

34852227	Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can be maintained in a continuum of cellular states with distinct features. Exogenous lipid supplements can relieve the dependence on de novo lipogenesis and shift global metabolism. However, it is largely unexplored how specific lipid components regulate metabolism and subsequently the pluripotency state. In this study, we report that the metabolic landscape of human PSCs (hPSCs) is shifted by signaling lipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which naturally exists. LPA leads to a distinctive transcriptome profile that is not associated with de novo lipogenesis. Although exogenous lipids such as cholesterol, common free fatty acids, and LPA can affect cellular metabolism, they are not necessary for maintaining primed pluripotency. Instead, LPA induces distinct and reversible phenotypes in cell cycle, morphology, and mitochondria. This study reveals a distinct primed state that could be used to alter cell physiology in hPSCs for basic research and stem cell applications.

34852230	The role of chromatin-associated RNAi components in the nucleus of mammalian cells and in particular in the context of developmental programs remains to be elucidated. Here, we investigate the function of nuclear Argonaute 1 (Ago1) in gene expression regulation during skeletal muscle differentiation. We show that Ago1 is required for activation of the myogenic program by supporting chromatin modification mediated by developmental enhancer activation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Ago1 directly controls global H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) by regulating enhancer RNA (eRNA)-CREB-binding protein (CBP) acetyltransferase interaction, a key step in enhancer-driven gene activation. In particular, we show that Ago1 is specifically required for myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD) and downstream myogenic gene activation, whereas its depletion leads to failure of CBP acetyltransferase activation and blocking of the myogenic program. Our work establishes a role of the mammalian enhancer-associated RNAi component Ago1 in epigenome regulation and activation of developmental programs.

34748727	Transcription factor 4 (TCF4) is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor essential for neurocognitive development. The aberrations in TCF4 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders including schizophrenia, intellectual disability, and Pitt-Hopkins syndrome, an autism-spectrum disorder characterized by developmental delay. Several disease-associated missense mutations in TCF4 have been shown to interfere with TCF4 function, but for many mutations, the impact remains undefined. Here, we tested the effects of 12 functionally uncharacterized disease-associated missense mutations and variations in TCF4 using transient expression in mammalian cells, confocal imaging, in vitro DNA-binding assays, and reporter assays. We show that Pitt-Hopkins syndrome-associated missense mutations within the basic helix-loop-helix domain of TCF4 and a Rett-like syndrome-associated mutation in a transcription activation domain result in altered DNA-binding and transcriptional activity of the protein. Some of the missense variations found in schizophrenia patients slightly increase TCF4 transcriptional activity, whereas no effects were detected for missense mutations linked to mild intellectual disability. We in addition find that the outcomes of several disease-related mutations are affected by cell type, TCF4 isoform, and dimerization partner, suggesting that the effects of TCF4 mutations are context-dependent. Together with previous work, this study provides a basis for the interpretation of the functional consequences of TCF4 missense variants.

34717957	Hepatocytes differ from columnar epithelial cells by their multipolar organization, which follows the initial formation of central lumen-sharing clusters of polarized cells as observed during liver development and regeneration. The molecular mechanism for hepatocyte polarity establishment, however, has been comparatively less studied than those for other epithelial cell types. Here, we show that the tight junction protein Par3 organizes hepatocyte polarization via cooperating with the small GTPase Cdc42 to target atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) to a cortical site near the center of cell-cell contacts. In 3D Matrigel culture of human hepatocytic HepG2 cells, which mimics a process of liver development and regeneration, depletion of Par3, Cdc42, or aPKC results in an impaired establishment of apicobasolateral polarity and a loss of subsequent apical lumen formation. The aPKC activity is also required for bile canalicular (apical) elongation in mouse primary hepatocytes. The lateral membrane-associated proteins Lgl1 and Lgl2, major substrates of aPKC, seem to be dispensable for hepatocyte polarity establishment because Lgl-depleted HepG2 cells are able to form a single apical lumen in 3D culture. On the other hand, Lgl depletion leads to lateral invasion of aPKC, and overexpression of Lgl1 or Lgl2 prevents apical lumen formation, indicating that they maintain proper lateral integrity. Thus, hepatocyte polarity establishment and apical lumen formation are organized by Par3, Cdc42, and aPKC; Par3 cooperates with Cdc42 to recruit aPKC, which plays a crucial role in apical membrane development and regulation of the lateral maintainer Lgl.

34876685	Defective silencing of retrotransposable elements has been linked to inflammageing, cancer and autoimmune diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms are only partially understood. Here we implicate the histone H3.3 chaperone Daxx, a retrotransposable element repressor inactivated in myeloid leukaemia and other neoplasms, in protection from inflammatory disease. Loss of Daxx alters the chromatin landscape, H3.3 distribution and histone marks of haematopoietic progenitors, leading to engagement of a Pu.1-dependent transcriptional programme for myelopoiesis at the expense of B-cell differentiation. This causes neutrophilia and inflammation, predisposing mice to develop an autoinflammatory skin disease. While these molecular and phenotypic perturbations are in part reverted in animals lacking both Pu.1 and Daxx, haematopoietic progenitors in these mice show unique chromatin and transcriptome alterations, suggesting an interaction between these two pathways. Overall, our findings implicate retrotransposable element silencing in haematopoiesis and suggest a cross-talk between the H3.3 loading machinery and the pioneer transcription factor Pu.1.

34480900	Acylation modifications, such as the succinylation of lysine, are post-translational modifications and a powerful means of regulating protein activity. Some acylations occur nonenzymatically, driven by an increase in the concentration of acyl group donors. Lysine succinylation has a profound effect on the corresponding site within the protein, as it dramatically changes the charge of the residue. In eukaryotes, it predominantly affects mitochondrial proteins because the donor of succinate, succinyl-CoA, is primarily generated in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Although numerous succinylated mitochondrial proteins have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a more detailed characterization of the yeast mitochondrial succinylome is still lacking. Here, we performed a proteomic MS analysis of purified yeast mitochondria and detected 314 succinylated mitochondrial proteins with 1763 novel succinylation sites. The mitochondrial nucleoid, a complex of mitochondrial DNA and mitochondrial proteins, is one of the structures whose protein components are affected by succinylation. We found that Abf2p, the principal component of mitochondrial nucleoids responsible for compacting mitochondrial DNA in S. cerevisiae, can be succinylated in vivo on at least thirteen lysine residues. Abf2p succinylation in vitro inhibits its DNA-binding activity and reduces its sensitivity to digestion by the ATP-dependent ScLon protease. We conclude that changes in the metabolic state of a cell resulting in an increase in the concentration of tricarboxylic acid intermediates may affect mitochondrial functions.

34634303	Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is an accurate tool to assess modified ribonucleosides and their dynamics in mammalian cells. However, MS/MS quantification of lowly abundant modifications in non-ribosomal RNAs is unreliable, and the dynamic features of various modifications are poorly understood. Here, we developed a (13)C labeling approach, called (13)C-dynamods, to quantify the turnover of base modifications in newly transcribed RNA. This turnover-based approach helped to resolve mRNA from ncRNA modifications in purified RNA or free ribonucleoside samples and showed the distinct kinetics of the N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) versus 7-methylguanosine (m(7)G) modification in polyA+-purified RNA. We uncovered that N6,N6-dimethyladenosine (m(6)2A) exhibits distinct turnover in small RNAs and free ribonucleosides when compared to known m(6)2A-modified large rRNAs. Finally, combined measurements of turnover and abundance of these modifications informed on the transcriptional versus posttranscriptional sensitivity of modified ncRNAs and mRNAs, respectively, to stress conditions. Thus, (13)C-dynamods enables studies of the origin of modified RNAs at steady-state and subsequent dynamics under nonstationary conditions. These results open new directions to probe the presence and biological regulation of modifications in particular RNAs.	Metabolic turnover and dynamics of modified ribonucleosides by (13)C labeling.

34469722	Alveolar epithelial type 2 cell (AEC2) dysfunction is implicated in the pathogenesis of adult and pediatric interstitial lung disease (ILD), including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF); however, identification of disease-initiating mechanisms has been impeded by inability to access primary AEC2s early on. Here, we present a human in vitro model permitting investigation of epithelial-intrinsic events culminating in AEC2 dysfunction, using patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) carrying an AEC2-exclusive disease-associated variant (SFTPC(I73T)). Comparing syngeneic mutant versus gene-corrected iPSCs after differentiation into AEC2s (iAEC2s), we find that mutant iAEC2s accumulate large amounts of misprocessed and mistrafficked pro-SFTPC protein, similar to in vivo changes, resulting in diminished AEC2 progenitor capacity, perturbed proteostasis, altered bioenergetic programs, time-dependent metabolic reprogramming, and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway activation. Treatment of SFTPC(I73T)-expressing iAEC2s with hydroxychloroquine, a medication used in pediatric ILD, aggravates the observed perturbations. Thus, iAEC2s provide a patient-specific preclinical platform for modeling the epithelial-intrinsic dysfunction at ILD inception.

34597669	Healing of cutaneous wounds requires the collective migration of epithelial keratinocytes to seal the wound bed from the environment. However, the signaling events that coordinate this collective migration are unclear. In this report, we address the role of phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) and attendant gene expression during wound healing. Wounding of human keratinocyte monolayers in vitro led to the rapid activation of the eIF2 kinase GCN2. We determined that deletion or pharmacological inhibition of GCN2 significantly delayed collective cell migration and wound closure. Global transcriptomic, biochemical, and cellular analyses indicated that GCN2 is necessary for maintenance of intracellular free amino acids, particularly cysteine, as well as coordination of RAC1-GTP-driven reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, lamellipodia formation, and focal adhesion dynamics following keratinocyte wounding. In vivo experiments using mice deficient for GCN2 validated the role of the eIF2 kinase during wound healing in intact skin. These results indicate that GCN2 is critical for appropriate induction of collective cell migration and plays a critical role in coordinating the re-epithelialization of cutaneous wounds.

34592156	The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) enters the nucleus to establish infection, but the role of nuclear envelope proteins in this process is incompletely understood. Inner nuclear transmembrane proteins SUN1 and SUN2 connect nuclear lamins to the cytoskeleton and participate in the DNA damage response (DDR). Increased levels of SUN1 or SUN2 potently restrict HIV infection through an unresolved mechanism. Here, we find that the antiviral activities of SUN1 and SUN2 are distinct. HIV-1 and HIV-2 are preferentially inhibited by SUN1 and SUN2, respectively. We identify DNA damage inducers that stimulate HIV-1 infection and show that SUN1, but not SUN2, neutralizes this effect. Finally, we show that chromatin movements and nuclear rotations are associated with the effects of SUN proteins and Lamin A/C on infection. These results reveal an emerging role of chromatin dynamics and the DDR in the control of HIV infection by structural components of the nuclear envelope.	Inhibition of HIV infection by structural proteins of the inner nuclear membrane is associated with reduced chromatin dynamics.	Cell reports	0.0	0
34936880	Pathogenic bacteria can rapidly respond to stresses such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) using reversible redox-sensitive oxidation of cysteine thiol (-SH) groups in regulators. Here, we use proteomics to profile reversible ROS-induced thiol oxidation in Vibrio cholerae, the etiologic agent of cholera, and identify two modified cysteines in ArcA, a regulator of global carbon oxidation that is phosphorylated and activated under low oxygen. ROS abolishes ArcA phosphorylation but induces the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond that promotes ArcA-ArcA interactions and sustains activity. ArcA cysteines are oxidized in cholera patient stools, and ArcA thiol oxidation drives in vitro ROS resistance, colonization of ROS-rich guts, and environmental survival. In other pathogens, such as Salmonella enterica, oxidation of conserved cysteines of ArcA orthologs also promotes ROS resistance, suggesting a common role for ROS-induced ArcA thiol oxidation in modulating ArcA activity, allowing for a balance of expression of stress- and pathogenesis-related genetic programs.

34788615	Brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic activity is tightly regulated by cellular redox status, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Protein S-nitrosylation, the nitric-oxide-mediated cysteine thiol protein modification, plays important roles in cellular redox regulation. Here we show that diet-induced obesity (DIO) and acute cold exposure elevate BAT protein S-nitrosylation, including UCP1. This thermogenic-induced nitric oxide bioactivity is regulated by S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR; alcohol dehydrogenase 5 [ADH5]), a denitrosylase that balances the intracellular nitroso-redox status. Loss of ADH5 in BAT impairs cold-induced UCP1-dependent thermogenesis and worsens obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Adh5 expression is induced by the transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), and administration of an HSF1 activator to BAT of DIO mice increases Adh5 expression and significantly improves UCP1-mediated respiration. Together, these data indicate that ADH5 controls BAT nitroso-redox homeostasis to regulate adipose thermogenesis, which may be therapeutically targeted to improve metabolic health.

34031543	SARS-CoV-2 infection poses a major threat to the lungs and multiple other organs, occasionally causing death. Until effective vaccines are developed to curb the pandemic, it is paramount to define the mechanisms and develop protective therapies to prevent organ dysfunction in patients with COVID-19. Individuals that develop severe manifestations have signs of dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses. Emerging evidence implicates neutrophils and the disbalance between neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and degradation plays a central role in the pathophysiology of inflammation, coagulopathy, organ damage, and immunothrombosis that characterize severe cases of COVID-19. Here, we discuss the evidence supporting a role for NETs in COVID-19 manifestations and present putative mechanisms, by which NETs promote tissue injury and immunothrombosis. We present therapeutic strategies, which have been successful in the treatment of immunomicron-inflammatory disorders and which target dysregulated NET formation or degradation, as potential approaches that may benefit patients with severe COVID-19.

34525362	Secretory cargos are collected at endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites (ERES) before transport to the Golgi apparatus. Decades of research have provided many details of the molecular events underlying ER-Golgi exchanges. Essential questions, however, remain about the organization of the ER-Golgi interface in cells and the type of membrane structures mediating traffic from ERES. To investigate these, we use transgenic tagging in Drosophila flies, 3D-structured illumination microscopy (SIM), and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) to characterize ERES-Golgi units in collagen-producing fat body, imaginal discs, and imaginal discs overexpressing ERES determinant Tango1. Facing ERES, we find a pre-cis-Golgi region, equivalent to the vertebrate ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), involved in both anterograde and retrograde transport. This pre-cis-Golgi is continuous with the rest of the Golgi, not a separate compartment or collection of large carriers, for which we find no evidence. We observe, however, many vesicles, as well as pearled tubules connecting ERES and Golgi.	ER exit sites in Drosophila display abundant ER-Golgi vesicles and pearled tubes but no megacarriers.

34964841	To control their movement, cells need to coordinate actin assembly with the geometric features of their substrate. Here, we uncover a role for the actin regulator WASP in the 3D migration of neutrophils. We show that WASP responds to substrate topology by enriching to sites of inward, substrate-induced membrane deformation. Superresolution imaging reveals that WASP preferentially enriches to the necks of these substrate-induced invaginations, a distribution that could support substrate pinching. WASP facilitates recruitment of the Arp2/3 complex to these sites, stimulating local actin assembly that couples substrate features with the cytoskeleton. Surprisingly, WASP only enriches to membrane deformations in the front half of the cell, within a permissive zone set by WASP's front-biased regulator Cdc42. While WASP KO cells exhibit relatively normal migration on flat substrates, they are defective at topology-directed migration. Our data suggest that WASP integrates substrate topology with cell polarity by selectively polymerizing actin around substrate-induced membrane deformations in the front half of the cell.

34496248	Cancer therapy urges targeting of malignant subsets within self-renewing heterogeneous stem cell populations. We dissect the genetic and functional heterogeneity of human glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) within patients by their innate responses to non-pathogenic mouse parvoviruses that are tightly restrained by cellular physiology. GSC neurospheres accumulate assembled capsids but restrict viral NS1 cytotoxic protein expression by an innate PKR/eIF2alpha-P response counteractable by electric pulses. NS1 triggers a comprehensive DNA damage response involving cell-cycle arrest, neurosphere disorganization, and bystander disruption of GSC-derived brain tumor architecture in rodent models. GSCs and cancer cell lines permissive to parvovirus genome replication require p53-Ser15 phosphorylation (Pp53S15). NS1 expression is enhanced by exogeneous Pp53S15 induction but repressed by wtp53. Consistently, patient-specific GSC subpopulations harboring p53 gain-of-function mutants and/or Pp53S15 are selective viral targets.

34525377	Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) can be maintained in vitro in defined N2B27 medium supplemented with two chemical inhibitors for GSK3 and MEK (2i) and the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which act synergistically to promote self-renewal and pluripotency. Here, we find that genetic deletion of the four genes encoding the TCF/LEF transcription factors confers mESCs with the ability to self-renew in N2B27 medium alone. TCF/LEF quadruple knockout (qKO) mESCs display dysregulation of several genes, including Aire, Dnmt3l, and IcosL, located adjacent to each other within a topologically associated domain (TAD). Aire, Dnmt3l, and IcosL appear to be regulated by TCF/LEF in a beta-catenin independent manner. Moreover, downregulation of Aire and Dnmt3l in wild-type mESCs mimics the loss of TCF/LEF and increases mESC survival in the absence of 2iL. Hence, this study identifies TCF/LEF effectors that mediate exit from the pluripotent state.

34782720	Metastasis is the leading cause of death of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Although an increasing number of studies have demonstrated the involvement of G3BP2 in several human cancers, how G3BP2 interacts with long noncoding RNAs and regulates mRNA transcripts in mediating ESCC metastasis remains unclear. In this study, we uncovered that G3BP2 was upregulated in ESCC. Further analysis revealed that upregulation of G3BP2 was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis, depth of tumor invasion and unfavorable outcomes in ESCC patients. Both in vitro and in vivo functional assays demonstrated that G3BP2 dramatically enhanced ESCC cell migration and invasion. Mechanistically, LINC01554 maintained the high G3BP2 expression in ESCC by protecting G3BP2 from degradation through ubiquitination and the interaction domains within LINC01554 and G3BP2 were identified. In addition, RNA-seq revealed that HDGF was regulated by G3BP2. G3BP2 bound to HDGF mRNA transcript to stabilize its expression. Ectopic expression of HDGF effectively abolished the G3BP2 depletion-mediated inhibitory effect on tumor cell migration. Intriguingly, introduction of compound C108 which can inhibit G3BP2 remarkedly suppressed ESCC cell metastasis in vitro and in vivo.

34465889	The F-box and WD-repeat-containing protein 2 (FBXW2) plays a crucial role as an E3 ligase in regulating tumorigenesis. However, the functions of FBXW2 in breast cancer are still unknown. Here, we find that nuclear factor-kB (NF-kappaB) p65 is a new substrate of FBXW2. FBXW2 directly binds to p65, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation. Interestingly, p300 acetylation of p65 blocks FBXW2 induced p65 ubiquitination. FBXW2-p65 axis is a crucial regulator of SOX2-induced stemness in breast cancer. Moreover, FBXW2 inhibits breast tumor growth by regulating p65 degradation in vitro and in vivo. FBXW2 overexpression abrogates the effects of p65 on paclitaxel resistance in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, FBXW2 induced p65 degradation is also confirmed in FBXW2-knockout mice. Our results identify FBXW2 as an important E3 ligase for p65 degradation, which provide insights into the tumor suppressor functions of FBXW2 in breast cancer.

34294889	Breast cancer heterogeneity has made it challenging to identify mechanisms critical to the initial stages of their genesis in vivo. Here, we sought to interrogate the role of YB-1 in newly arising human breast cancers as well as in established cell lines. In a first series of experiments, we found that short-hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of YB-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells blocked both their local tumour-forming and lung-colonising activity in immunodeficient mice. Conversely, upregulated expression of YB-1 enhanced the poor in vivo tumorigenicity of T47D cells. We then found that YB-1 knockdown also inhibits the initial generation in mice of invasive ductal carcinomas and ductal carcinomas in situ from freshly isolated human mammary cells transduced, respectively, with KRAS(G12D) or myristoylated-AKT1. Interestingly, increased expression of HIF1alpha and G3BP1, two YB-1 translational targets and elements of a stress-adaptive programme, mirrored the levels of YB-1 in both transformed primary and established MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.

34706240	Blood endothelial cells display remarkable plasticity depending on the demands of a malignant microenvironment. While studies in solid tumors focus on their role in metabolic adaptations, formation of high endothelial venules (HEVs) in lymph nodes extends their role to the organization of immune cell interactions. As a response to lymphoma growth, blood vessel density increases; however, the fate of HEVs remains elusive. Here, we report that lymphoma causes severe HEV regression in mouse models that phenocopies aggressive human B cell lymphomas. HEV dedifferentiation occurrs as a consequence of a disrupted lymph-carrying conduit system. Mechanosensitive fibroblastic reticular cells then deregulate CCL21 migration paths, followed by deterioration of dendritic cell proximity to HEVs. Loss of this crosstalk deprives HEVs of lymphotoxin-beta-receptor (LTbetaR) signaling, which is indispensable for their differentiation and lymphocyte transmigration. Collectively, this study reveals a remodeling cascade of the lymph node microenvironment that is detrimental for immune cell trafficking in lymphoma.

34826420	The maintenance of optimal membrane composition under basal and stress conditions is critical for the survival of an organism. High-glucose stress has been shown to perturb membrane properties by decreasing membrane fluidity, and the membrane sensor PAQR-2 is required to restore membrane integrity. However, the mechanisms required to respond to elevated dietary glucose are not fully established. In this study, we used a (13)C stable isotope-enriched diet and mass spectrometry to better understand the impact of glucose on fatty acid dynamics in the membrane of Caenorhabditis elegans. We found a novel role for monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids (mmBCFAs) in mediating the ability of the nematodes to survive conditions of elevated dietary glucose. This requirement of mmBCFAs is unique to glucose stress and was not observed when the nematode was fed elevated dietary saturated fatty acid. In addition, when worms deficient in elo-5, the major biosynthesis enzyme of mmBCFAs, were fed Bacillus subtilis (a bacteria strain rich in mmBCFAs) in combination with high glucose, their survival rates were rescued to wild-type levels. Finally, the results suggest that mmBCFAs are part of the PAQR-2 signaling response during glucose stress. Taken together, we have identified a novel role for mmBCFAs in stress response in nematodes and have established these fatty acids as critical for adapting to elevated glucose.

34525376	During embryogenesis, waves of hematopoietic progenitors develop from hemogenic endothelium (HE) prior to the emergence of self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Although previous studies have shown that yolk-sac-derived erythromyeloid progenitors and HSCs emerge from distinct populations of HE, it remains unknown whether the earliest lymphoid-competent progenitors, multipotent progenitors, and HSCs originate from common HE. In this study, we demonstrate by clonal assays and single-cell transcriptomics that rare HE with functional HSC potential in the early murine embryo are distinct from more abundant HE with multilineage hematopoietic potential that fail to generate HSCs. Specifically, HSC-competent HE are characterized by expression of CXCR4 surface marker and by higher expression of genes tied to arterial programs regulating HSC dormancy and self-renewal. Taken together, these findings suggest a revised model of developmental hematopoiesis in which the initial populations of multipotent progenitors and HSCs arise independently from HE with distinct phenotypic and transcriptional properties.

34800436	The two-pore channels (TPCs) are voltage-gated cation channels consisting of single polypeptides with two repeats of a canonical 6-transmembrane unit. TPCs are known to be regulated by various physiological signals such as membrane voltage and phosphoinositide (PI). The fourth helix in the second repeat (second S4) plays a major role in detecting membrane voltage, whereas the first repeat contains a PI binding site. Therefore, each of these stimuli is detected by a unique repeat to regulate the gating of the TPC central pore. How these various stimuli regulate the dynamic structural rearrangement of the TPC molecule remain unknown. Here, we found that PI binding to the first repeat in TPC3 regulates the movement of the distally located second S4 helix, showing that the PI-binding signal is not confined to the pore gate but also transmitted to the voltage sensor. Using voltage clamp fluorometry, measurement of gating charges, and Cys-accessibility analysis, we observed that PI binding significantly potentiates the voltage dependence of the movement of the second S4 helix. Notably, voltage clamp fluorometry analysis revealed that the voltage-dependent movement of the second S4 helix occurred in two phases, of which the second phase corresponds to the transfer of the gating charges. This movement was observed in the voltage range where gate-opening occurs and was potentiated by PI. In conclusion, this regulation of the second S4 helix by PI indicates a tight inter-repeat coupling within TPC3, a feature which might be conserved among TPC family members to integrate various physiological signals.

34496235	beta5t is a cortical thymic epithelial cell (cTEC)-specific component of the thymoproteasome, which is essential for the optimal production of functionally competent CD8(+) T cells. Our recent analysis showed a specific impact of beta5t on proteasome subunit composition in cTECs, supporting the possibility that the thymoproteasome optimizes CD8(+) T cell development through the production of MHC-I-associated unique self-peptides in cTECs. However, a recent article reports that beta5t regulates the expression of hundreds of cTEC genes and affects both CD4(+) and CD8(+) thymocytes by causing oxidative stress in thymocytes. The authors further analyze our published data and describe that they confirm their conclusions. Here, we examine the issues that they raise and conclude that, rather than regulating hundreds of genes in cTECs, beta5t has a highly specific impact in cTECs on proteasome subunit composition.

34433030	"The relationship between B cells and CD4 T cells has been carefully studied, revealing a collaborative effort in which B cells promote the activation, differentiation, and expansion of CD4 T cells while the so-called ""helper"" cells provide signals to B cells, influencing their class switching and fate. Interactions between B cells and CD8 T cells are not as well studied, although CD8 T cells exhibit an accelerated contraction after certain infections in B-cell-deficient mice. Here, we find that B cells significantly enhance primary CD8 T cell responses after vaccination. Moreover, memory CD8 numbers and function are impaired in B-cell-deficient animals, leading to increased susceptibility to bacterial challenge. We also show that interleukin-27 production by B cells contributes to their impact on primary, but not memory, CD8 responses. Better understanding of the interactions between CD8 T cells and B cells may aid in the design of more effective future vaccine strategies."

34986347	Fibrosis is a major cause of mortality worldwide, characterized by myofibroblast activation and excessive extracellular matrix deposition. Systemic sclerosis is a prototypic fibrotic disease in which CXCL4 is increased and strongly correlates with skin and lung fibrosis. Here we aim to elucidate the role of CXCL4 in fibrosis development. CXCL4 levels are increased in multiple inflammatory and fibrotic mouse models, and, using CXCL4-deficient mice, we demonstrate the essential role of CXCL4 in promoting fibrotic events in the skin, lungs, and heart. Overexpressing human CXCL4 in mice aggravates, whereas blocking CXCL4 reduces, bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Single-cell ligand-receptor analysis predicts CXCL4 to affect endothelial cells and fibroblasts. In vitro, we confirm that CXCL4 directly induces myofibroblast differentiation and collagen synthesis in different precursor cells, including endothelial cells, by stimulating endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Our findings identify a pivotal role of CXCL4 in fibrosis, further substantiating the potential role of neutralizing CXCL4 as a therapeutic strategy.

34615997	Ribosome biogenesis plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis by supporting robust protein translation. We investigate the functional and molecular mechanism of Zinc finger protein 545 (ZNF545), a transcriptional repressor for ribosomal RNA (rRNA), in colorectal cancer (CRC). ZNF545 was silenced in CRC compared to adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.0001), implying a tumor-suppressive role. Colon-specific Znf545 knockout in mice accelerated CRC in Apc(Min/+) and azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium-induced CRC. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that ZNF545 uses its two zinc finger clusters to bind to minimal rDNA promoter, where it assembled transcriptional repressor complex by interacting with KAP1. Znf545 deletion in mouse embryonic fibroblasts not only increased rRNA transcription rate and the nucleolar size and number but also altered the nucleolar composition and architecture with an increased number of fibrillar centers surrounded by net-like dense fibrillar components. Consequently, Znf545 deletion promoted the gene expression of translation machinery, protein translation, and cell growth. Consistent with its tumor-suppressive role, ZNF545 overexpression in CRC cells induced growth arrest and apoptosis. Finally, administration of rRNA synthesis inhibitor, CX-5461, inhibited CRC development in Znf545(Delta/Delta)Apc(Min/+) mice. In conclusion, ZNF545 suppresses CRC through repressing rRNA transcription and protein translation. Targeting rRNA biosynthesis in ZNF545-silenced tumors is a potential therapeutic strategy for CRC.

34450043	The type V-K CRISPR-Cas system, featured by Cas12k effector with a naturally inactivated RuvC domain and associated with Tn7-like transposon for RNA-guided DNA transposition, is a promising tool for precise DNA insertion. To reveal the mechanism underlying target DNA recognition, we determined a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of Cas12k from cyanobacteria Scytonema hofmanni in complex with a single guide RNA (sgRNA) and a double-stranded target DNA. Coupled with mutagenesis and in vitro DNA transposition assay, our results revealed mechanisms for the recognition of the GGTT protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence and the structural elements of Cas12k critical for RNA-guided DNA transposition. These structural and mechanistic insights should aid in the development of type V-K CRISPR-transposon systems as tools for genome editing.

34675408	Small intestine adenocarcinoma is a rare intestinal malignancy with distinct clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics. Recently, a fusion of the intestinal stem-cell marker olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) and the proto-oncogene RET has been identified in a small intestine adenocarcinoma patient. Here we investigated the biological effects of OLFM4-RET fusion and whether it can initiate tumorigenesis in small intestine. OLFM4 expression was found to be frequently lost or reduced in human small intestine adenocarcinoma, and its downregulation correlated with high tumor grade and advanced tumor stage. Expression of OLFM4-RET fusion-induced cellular transformation in HEK293 cells and blocked RET-induced inhibition of colony growth in HuTu 80 small intestine adenocarcinoma cells. Further, expression of OLFM4-RET activated the RAS-RAF-MAPK and STAT3 cell signaling pathways in both HEK293 cells and HuTu 80 cells. OLFM4-RET expression in HEK293 cells upregulated multiple families of genes related to carcinogenesis, cancer progression, and metastasis. Targeted expression of OLFM4-RET in the small intestine led to the development of hyperplasia, adenoma, or adenocarcinoma in transgenic mice. Our study suggests that OLFM4-RET is an oncogenic driver of small intestine tumorigenesis. Therefore, the small intestine adenocarcinoma patients with OLFM4-RET fusion may benefit from treatment with RET kinase inhibitor.

34698427	Aneuploidy is a chromosomal abnormality associated with poor prognosis in many cancer types. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the unfolded protein response (UPR) mechanistically links aneuploidy and local immune dysregulation. Using a single somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) score inclusive of whole-chromosome, chromosome arm, and focal alterations in a pan-cancer analysis of 9,375 samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we found an inverse correlation with a cytotoxicity (CYT) score across disease stages. Co-expression patterns of UPR genes changed substantially between SCNA(low) and SCNA(high) groups. Pathway activity scores showed increased activity of multiple branches of the UPR in response to aneuploidy. The PERK branch showed the strongest association with a reduced CYT score. The conditioned medium of aneuploid cells transmitted XBP1 splicing and caused IL-6 and arginase 1 transcription in receiver bone marrow-derived macrophages and markedly diminished the production of IFN-gamma and granzyme B in activated human T cells. We propose the UPR as a mechanistic link between aneuploidy and immune dysregulation in the tumor microenvironment.	The unfolded protein response links tumor aneuploidy to local immune dysregulation.

34413485	The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) regulates metabolic reprogramming in lung macrophages and the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. Fibrosis progression is associated with apoptosis resistance in lung macrophages; however, the mechanism(s) by which apoptosis resistance occurs is poorly understood. Here, we found a marked increase in mitochondrial B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) in lung macrophages from subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Similar findings were seen in bleomycin-injured wild-type (WT) mice, whereas Bcl-2 was markedly decreased in mice expressing a dominant-negative mitochondrial calcium uniporter (DN-MCU). Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a), the rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid beta-oxidation, directly interacted with Bcl-2 by binding to its BH3 domain, which anchored Bcl-2 in the mitochondria to attenuate apoptosis. This interaction was dependent on Cpt1a activity. Lung macrophages from IPF subjects had a direct correlation between CPT1A and Bcl-2, whereas the absence of binding induced apoptosis. The deletion of Bcl-2 in macrophages protected mice from developing pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, mice had resolution when Bcl-2 was deleted or was inhibited with ABT-199 after fibrosis was established. These observations implicate an interplay between macrophage fatty acid beta-oxidation, apoptosis resistance, and dysregulated fibrotic remodeling.

34922943	DNA N6-adenine methylation (6mA), as a novel adenine modification existing in eukaryotes, shows essential functions in embryogenesis and mitochondrial transcriptions. ALKBH1 is a demethylase of 6mA and plays critical roles in osteogenesis, tumorigenesis, and adaptation to stress. However, the integrated biological functions of ALKBH1 still require further exploration. Here, we demonstrate that knockdown of ALKBH1 inhibits adipogenic differentiation in both human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, while overexpression of ALKBH1 leads to increased adipogenesis. Using a combination of RNA-seq and N6-mA-DNA-IP-seq analyses, we identify hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling as a crucial downstream target of ALKBH1 activity. Depletion of ALKBH1 leads to hypermethylation of both HIF-1alpha and its downstream target GYS1. Simultaneous overexpression of HIF-1alpha and GYS1 restores the adipogenic commitment of ALKBH1-deficient cells. Taken together, our data indicate that ALKBH1 is indispensable for adipogenic differentiation, revealing a novel epigenetic mechanism that regulates adipogenesis.

34461090	A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13) is a multidomain metalloprotease for which until now only a single substrate has been identified. ADAMTS13 cleaves the polymeric force-sensor von Willebrand factor (VWF) that unfolds under shear stress and recruits platelets to sites of vascular injury. Shear force-dependent cleavage at a single Tyr-Met peptide bond in the unfolded VWF A2 domain serves to reduce the size of VWF polymers in circulation. In patients with immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP), a rare life-threatening disease, ADAMTS13 is targeted by autoantibodies that inhibit its activity or promote its clearance. In the absence of ADAMTS13, VWF polymers are not adequately processed, resulting in spontaneous adhesion of blood platelets, which presents as severe, life-threatening microvascular thrombosis. In healthy individuals, ADAMTS13-VWF interactions are guided by controlled conversion of ADAMTS13 from a closed, inactive to an open, active conformation through a series of interdomain contacts that are now beginning to be defined. Recently, it has been shown that ADAMTS13 adopts an open conformation in the acute phase and during subclinical disease in iTTP patients, making open ADAMTS13 a novel biomarker for iTTP. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge on ADAMTS13 conformation and speculate on potential triggers inducing conformational changes of ADAMTS13 and how these relate to the pathogenesis of iTTP.

34965379	Ferroptosis is a unique type of non-apoptotic cell death resulting from the unrestrained occurrence of peroxidized phospholipids, which are subject to iron-mediated production of lethal oxygen radicals. This cell death modality has been detected across many organisms, including in mammals, where it can be used as a defense mechanism against pathogens or even harnessed by T cells to sensitize tumor cells toward effective killing. Conversely, ferroptosis is considered one of the main cell death mechanisms promoting degenerative diseases. Emerging evidence suggests that ferroptosis represents a vulnerability in certain cancers. Here, we critically review recent advances linking ferroptosis vulnerabilities of dedifferentiating and persister cancer cells to the dependency of these cells on iron, a potential Achilles heel for small-molecule intervention. We provide a perspective on the mechanisms reliant on iron that contribute to the persister cancer cell state and how this dependency may be exploited for therapeutic benefits.

34952003	Actinobacterial 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase reversibly catalyzes the thiamine diphosphate-dependent cleavage of 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA to formyl-CoA and acetone. This enzyme has great potential for use in synthetic one-carbon assimilation pathways for sustainable production of chemicals, but lacks details of substrate binding and reaction mechanism for biochemical reengineering. We determined crystal structures of the tetrameric enzyme in the closed conformation with bound substrate, covalent postcleavage intermediate, and products, shedding light on active site architecture and substrate interactions. Together with molecular dynamics simulations of the covalent precleavage complex, the complete catalytic cycle is structurally portrayed, revealing a proton transfer from the substrate acyl Cbeta hydroxyl to residue E493 that returns it subsequently to the postcleavage Calpha-carbanion intermediate. Kinetic parameters obtained for mutants E493A, E493Q, and E493K confirm the catalytic role of E493 in the WT enzyme. However, the 10- and 50-fold reduction in lyase activity in the E493A and E493Q mutants, respectively, compared with WT suggests that water molecules may contribute to proton transfer. The putative catalytic glutamate is located on a short alpha-helix close to the active site. This structural feature appears to be conserved in related lyases, such as human 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase 2. Interestingly, a unique feature of the actinobacterial 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase is a large C-terminal lid domain that, together with active site residues L127 and I492, restricts substrate size to </=C5 2-hydroxyacyl residues. These details about the catalytic mechanism and determinants of substrate specificity pave the ground for designing tailored catalysts for acyloin condensations for one-carbon and short-chain substrates in biotechnological applications.

34750516	The low survival rate of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients is primarily attributed to technical limitations and a lack of insight regarding the molecular mechanisms contributing to its progression. Alterations in epigenetic modulators are critical to cancer development and prognosis. BRD4, a chromatin reader protein, plays an essential role in regulating oncogene expression. Here, we investigated the contributing role of BRD4 and its related mechanisms in the context of ESCC tumor progression. Our observations showed that BRD4 transcript and protein expression levels are significantly increased in ESCC patient tissues. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of BRD4 suppressed ESCC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses were subsequently used to deduce the potential targets of BRD4. Mechanistic studies showed that RCC2 is a downstream target of BRD4. Inhibition of either BRD4 or RCC2 resulted in decreased ESCC cell proliferation. The BRD4-TP73 interaction facilitated the binding of BRD4 complex to the promoter region of RCC2, and subsequently modulated RCC2 transcription. Furthermore, targeting BRD4 with inhibitors significantly decreased tumor volume in ESCC PDX models, indicating that BRD4 expression may contribute to tumor progression. Collectively, these findings suggest that BRD4 inhibition could be a promising strategy to treat ESCC by downregulating RCC2.

34569703	Obesity mainly results from a chronic energy imbalance. Promoting browning of white adipocytes is a promising strategy to enhance energy expenditure and combat obesity. N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant mRNA modification in eukaryotes, plays an important role in regulating adipogenesis. However, whether m6A regulates white adipocyte browning was unknown. Here, we report that adipose tissue-specific deletion of Fto, an m6A demethylase, predisposes mice to prevent high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity by enhancing energy expenditure. Additionally, deletion of FTO in vitro promotes thermogenesis and white-to-beige adipocyte transition. Mechanistically, FTO deficiency increases the m6A level of Hif1a mRNA, which is recognized by m6A-binding protein YTHDC2, facilitating mRNA translation and increasing HIF1A protein abundance. HIF1A activates the transcription of thermogenic genes, including Ppaggc1a, Prdm16, and Pparg, thereby promoting Ucp1 expression and the browning process. Collectively, these results unveil an epigenetic mechanism by which m6A-facilitated HIF1A expression controls browning of white adipocytes and thermogenesis, providing a potential target to counteract obesity and metabolic disease.	m6A methylation promotes white-to-beige fat transition by facilitating Hif1a translation.

34965418	Enteric pathogens overcome barrier immunity within the intestinal environment that includes the endogenous flora. The microbiota produces diverse ligands, and the full spectrum of microbial products that are sensed by the epithelium and prime protective immunity is unknown. Using Drosophila, we find that the gut presents a high barrier to infection, which is partially due to signals from the microbiota, as loss of the microbiota enhances oral viral infection. We report cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) feeding is sufficient to protect microbiota-deficient flies from enhanced oral infection, suggesting that bacterial-derived CDNs induce immunity. Mechanistically, we find CDN protection is dSTING- and dTBK1-dependent, leading to NF-kB-dependent gene expression. Furthermore, we identify the apical nucleoside transporter, CNT2, as required for oral CDN protection. Altogether, our studies define a role for bacterial products in priming immune defenses in the gut.	Orally acquired cyclic dinucleotides drive dSTING-dependent antiviral immunity in enterocytes.

34634304	Golgi-resident bisphosphate nucleotidase 2 (BPNT2) is a member of a family of magnesium-dependent, lithium-inhibited phosphatases that share a three-dimensional structural motif that directly coordinates metal binding to effect phosphate hydrolysis. BPNT2 catalyzes the breakdown of 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphate, a by-product of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) sulfation. KO of BPNT2 in mice leads to skeletal abnormalities because of impaired GAG sulfation, especially chondroitin-4-sulfation, which is critical for proper extracellular matrix development. Mutations in BPNT2 have also been found to underlie a chondrodysplastic disorder in humans. The precise mechanism by which the loss of BPNT2 impairs sulfation remains unclear. Here, we used mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to test the hypothesis that the catalytic activity of BPNT2 is required for GAG sulfation in vitro. We show that a catalytic-dead Bpnt2 construct (D108A) does not rescue impairments in intracellular or secreted sulfated GAGs, including decreased chondroitin-4-sulfate, present in Bpnt2-KO MEFs. We also demonstrate that missense mutations in Bpnt2 adjacent to the catalytic site, which are known to cause chondrodysplasia in humans, recapitulate defects in overall GAG sulfation and chondroitin-4-sulfation in MEF cultures. We further show that treatment of MEFs with lithium (a common psychotropic medication) inhibits GAG sulfation and that this effect depends on the presence of BPNT2. Taken together, this work demonstrates that the catalytic activity of an enzyme potently inhibited by lithium can modulate GAG sulfation and therefore extracellular matrix composition, revealing new insights into lithium pharmacology.

34731601	Neurovascular coupling (NVC), the process that links neuronal activity to cerebral blood flow changes, has been mainly studied in superficial brain areas, namely the neocortex. Whether the conventional, rapid, and spatially restricted NVC response can be generalized to deeper and functionally diverse brain regions remains unknown. Implementing an approach for in vivo two-photon imaging from the ventral surface of the brain, we show that a systemic homeostatic challenge, acute salt loading, progressively increases hypothalamic vasopressin (VP) neuronal firing and evokes a vasoconstriction that reduces local blood flow. Vasoconstrictions are blocked by topical application of a VP receptor antagonist or tetrodotoxin, supporting mediation by activity-dependent, dendritically released VP. Salt-induced inverse NVC results in a local hypoxic microenvironment, which evokes positive feedback excitation of VP neurons. Our results reveal a physiological mechanism by which inverse NVC responses regulate systemic homeostasis, further supporting the notion of brain heterogeneity in NVC responses.	Inverse neurovascular coupling contributes to positive feedback excitation of vasopressin neurons during a systemic homeostatic challenge.	Cell reports	0.0	0
35104164	Social memory enables one to recognize and distinguish specific individuals. It is fundamental to social behaviors that can be mediated by the oxytocin receptor (OXTR), such as forming relationships. We investigated the molecular regulation and function of OXTR in animal behavior involving social memory. We found that Ser(261) in OXTR was phosphorylated by protein kinase D1 (PKD1). Neuronal Ca(2+) signaling and behavior analyses revealed that rats expressing a mutated form of OXTR that cannot be phosphorylated at this residue (OXTR S261A) in the medial amygdala (MeA) exhibited impaired long-term social memory (LTSM). Blocking the phosphorylation of wild-type OXTR in the MeA using an interfering peptide in rats or through conditional knockout of Pkd1 in mice reduced social memory retention, whereas expression of a phosphomimetic mutant of OXTR rescued it. In HEK293A cells, the PKD1-mediated phosphorylation of OXTR promoted its binding to Gq protein and, in turn, OXTR-mediated phosphorylation of PKD1, indicating a positive feedback loop. In addition, OXTR with a single-nucleotide polymorphism found in humans (rs200362197), which has a mutation in the conserved recognition region in the PKD1 phosphorylation site, showed impaired activation and signaling in vitro and in HEK293A cells similar to that of the S216A mutant. Our findings describe a phosphoregulatory loop for OXTR and its critical role in social behavior that might be further explored in associated disorders.

34525374	Filopodia assemble unique integrin-adhesion complexes to sense the extracellular matrix. However, the mechanisms of integrin regulation in filopodia are poorly defined. Here, we report that active integrins accumulate at the tip of myosin-X (MYO10)-positive filopodia, while inactive integrins are uniformly distributed. We identify talin and MYO10 as the principal integrin activators in filopodia. In addition, deletion of MYO10's FERM domain, or mutation of its beta1-integrin-binding residues, reveals MYO10 as facilitating integrin activation, but not transport, in filopodia. However, MYO10's isolated FERM domain alone cannot activate integrins, potentially because of binding to both integrin tails. Finally, because a chimera construct generated by swapping MYO10-FERM by talin-FERM enables integrin activation in filopodia, our data indicate that an integrin-binding FERM domain coupled to a myosin motor is a core requirement for integrin activation in filopodia. Therefore, we propose a two-step integrin activation model in filopodia: receptor tethering by MYO10 followed by talin-mediated integrin activation.

34847358	Accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen triggers an unfolded protein response (UPR) for stress adaptation, the failure of which induces cell apoptosis and tissue/organ damage. The molecular switches underlying how the UPR selects for stress adaptation over apoptosis remain unknown. Here, we discovered that accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins selectively induces N(6)-adenosine-methyltransferase-14 (METTL14) expression. METTL14 promotes C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) mRNA decay through its 3' UTR N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) to inhibit its downstream pro-apoptotic target gene expression. UPR induces METTL14 expression by competing against the HRD1-ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery to block METTL14 ubiquitination and degradation. Therefore, mice with liver-specific METTL14 deletion are highly susceptible to both acute pharmacological and alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency-induced ER proteotoxic stress and liver injury. Further hepatic CHOP deletion protects METTL14 knockout mice from ER-stress-induced liver damage. Our study reveals a crosstalk between ER stress and mRNA m(6)A modification pathways, termed the ERm(6)A pathway, for ER stress adaptation to proteotoxicity.

34496239	Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) possesses glioma stem cells (GSCs) that promote self-renewal, tumor propagation, and relapse. Understanding the mechanisms of GSCs self-renewal can offer targeted therapeutic interventions. However, insufficient knowledge of GSCs' fundamental biology is a significant bottleneck hindering these efforts. Here, we show that patient-derived GSCs recruit elevated levels of proteins that ensure the temporal cilium disassembly, leading to suppressed ciliogenesis. Depleting the cilia disassembly complex components is sufficient to induce ciliogenesis in a subset of GSCs via relocating platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFR-alpha) to a newly induced cilium. Importantly, restoring ciliogenesis enabled GSCs to switch from self-renewal to differentiation. Finally, using an organoid-based glioma invasion assay and brain xenografts in mice, we establish that ciliogenesis-induced differentiation can prevent the infiltration of GSCs into the brain. Our findings illustrate a role for cilium as a molecular switch in determining GSCs' fate and suggest cilium induction as an attractive strategy to intervene in GSCs proliferation.

34461094	Transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels, as important membrane proteins regulating intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)i) signaling, are involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. Activation and regulation of TRPC are more dependent on membrane or intracellular signals. However, how extracellular signals regulate TRPC6 function remains to be further investigated. Here, we suggest that two distinct small molecules, M085 and GSK1702934A, directly activate TRPC6, both through a mechanism of stimulation of extracellular sites formed by the pore helix (PH) and transmembrane (TM) helix S6. In silico docking scanning of TRPC6 identified three extracellular sites that can bind small molecules, of which only mutations on residues of PH and S6 helix significantly reduced the apparent affinity of M085 and GSK1702934A and attenuated the maximal response of TRPC6 to these two chemicals by altering channel gating of TRPC6. Combing metadynamics, molecular dynamics simulations, and mutagenesis, we revealed that W679, E671, E672, and K675 in the PH and N701 and Y704 in the S6 helix constitute an orthosteric site for the recognition of these two agonists. The importance of this site was further confirmed by covalent modification of amino acid residing at the interface of the PH and S6 helix. Given that three structurally distinct agonists M085, GSK1702934A, and AM-0883, act at this site, as well as the occupancy of lipid molecules at this position found in other TRP subfamilies, it is suggested that the cavity formed by the PH and S6 has an important role in the regulation of TRP channel function by extracellular signals.	GSK1702934A and M085 directly activate TRPC6 via a mechanism of stimulating the extracellular cavity formed by the pore helix and transmembrane helix S6.	The Journal of biological chemistry	2.0	0
