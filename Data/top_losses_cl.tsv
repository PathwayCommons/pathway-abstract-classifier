31969690	Neonatal mammalian heart maintains a transient regeneration capacity after birth, whereas this regeneration ability gradually loses in the postnatal heart. Thus, the reactivation of cardiomyocyte proliferation is emerging as a key strategy for inducing heart regeneration in adults. We have reported that a highly conserved long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) LncDACH1 was overexpressed in the failing hearts. Here, we found that LncDACH1 was gradually upregulated in the postnatal hearts. Cardiac-specific overexpression of LncDACH1 (TG) in mice suppressed neonatal heart regeneration and worsened cardiac function after apical resection. Conversely, in vivo cardiac conditional knockout of LncDACH1 (CKO) and adenovirus-mediated silencing of endogenous LncDACH1 reactivated cardiomyocyte-proliferative potential and promoted heart regeneration after myocardial infarction (MI) in juvenile and adult mice. Mechanistically, LncDACH1 was found to directly bind to protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit alpha (PP1A), and in turn, limit its dephosphorylation activity. Consistently, PP1A siRNA or pharmacological blockers of PP1A abrogated cardiomyocyte mitosis induced by LncDACH1 silencing. Furthermore, LncDACH1 enhanced yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) phosphorylation and reduced its nuclear translocation by binding PP1A. Verteporfin, a YAP1 inhibitor decreased LncDACH1 silencing-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation. In addition, targeting a conserved fragment of LncDACH1 caused cell cycle re-entry of human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Collectively, LncDACH1 governs heart regeneration in postnatal and ischemic hearts via regulating PP1A/YAP1 signal, which confers a novel therapeutic strategy for ischemic heart diseases.

31959915	The identification of viability-associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is a means of uncovering therapeutic approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In addition, aberrant genome-wide hypomethylation has been implicated in HCC initiation and progression. However, the relationship between lncRNA dysregulation and genome-wide hypomethylation in hepatocarcinogenesis has not been fully elucidated. A novel lncRNA named LINC00662 was previously demonstrated to play a role in gastrointestinal cancer. In this study, we demonstrated that this lncRNA was correlated with survival and exhibited oncogenic properties, both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we determined that LINC00662 could lead to genome-wide hypomethylation and alter the genomic methylation profile by synchronously reducing the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) level and enhancing the S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) level. Mechanistically, LINC00662 was determined to regulate the key enzymes influencing SAM and SAH levels, namely, methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A) and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AHCY), by RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions. In addition, we demonstrated that some SAM-dependent HCC-promoting genes could be regulated by LINC00662 by altering the methylation status of their promoters via the LINC00662-coupled axes of MAT1A/SAM and AHCY/SAH. Taken together, the results of this this study indicate that LINC00662 could be a potential biomarker for HCC therapy. More importantly, we proposed a new role of lncRNA in regulating genomic methylation to promote oncogene activation.

32127658	Autophagy is a cellular catabolic process that maintains intracellular homeostasis using lysosomal degradation systems. We demonstrate that inhibiting autophagy by depleting essential autophagy elongation proteins, Atg5 or Atg7, induces ISG15 expression through STING-mediated cytosolic dsDNA response. Genome stability is impaired in ATG5- or ATG7-depleted cells, and thus, double-strand breakages of DNA increase and cytosolic dsDNA accumulates. Accumulated cytosolic dsDNA induces the STING pathway to activate type I IFN signals which induce STAT1 activity and downregulate ATF3. When depletion of ATG5 or ATG7 inhibits autophagy, ATF3 is downregulated and STAT1 is upregulated. Furthermore, inhibiting autophagy induces ISG15 expression through STAT1 activation, which promotes acquisition of tumor-associated phenotypes such as migration, invasion, and proliferation. In conclusion, it appears that via the STING-mediated cytosolic dsDNA response, the STAT1-ISG15 axis mediates the relationship between autophagy and the immune system in relation to tumor progression. Moreover, combined with autophagy control, regulating ISG15 expression could be a novel strategy for cancer immunotherapy.

32447347	Senescence is accompanied with histones level alteration; however, the roles and the mechanisms of histone reduction in cellular senescence are largely unknown. Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is the major enzyme that generates monomethyl and asymmetrical dimethyl arginine. Here we showed that abrogation of PRMT1-mediated senescence was accompanied with decreasing histone H4 level. Consistently, under multiple classic senescence models, H4 decreasing was also been found prior to the other 3 core histones. Noticeably, asymmetric demethylation of histone H4 at arginine 3 (H4R3me2as), catalyzed by PRMT1, was decreased prior to histone H4. In addition, we showed that the PRMT1-mediated H4R3me2as maintained H4 stability. Reduction of H4R3me2as level increased the interaction between proteasome activator PA200 and histone H4, which catalyzes the poly-ubiquitin-independent degradation of H4. Moreover, H4 degradation promoted nucleosome decomposition, resulting in increased senescence-associated genes transcription. Significantly, H4 was restored by 3 well-informed anti-aging drugs (metformin, rapamycin, and resveratrol) much earlier than other senescence markers detected under H2O2-induced senescence. Thus, we uncovered a novel function of H4R3me2as in modulation of cellular senescence via regulating H4 stability. This finding also points to the value of histone H4 as a senescence indicator and a potential anti-aging drug screening marker.

32376875	We have previously reported that Monoglyceride Lipase (MGL) expression is absent or reduced in various human malignancies and MGL-deficient mice develop tumors in multiple organs. Evidence also suggests MGL to be a tumor suppressor, however, the mechanisms underlying its tumor-suppressive actions remain to be investigated. Here, we report a novel function of MGL as a negative regulator of XIAP, an important inhibitor of apoptosis. We found that MGL directly interacted with XIAP and enhanced E3-ligase activity and proteasomal degradation of XIAP. MGL overexpression induced cell death that was coupled with caspase activation and reduced XIAP levels. N-terminus of MGL was found to mediate interactions with XIAP and induce cell death. MGL-deficient cells exhibited elevated XIAP levels and exhibited resistance to anticancer drugs. XIAP expression was significantly elevated in tissues of MGL-deficient animals as well as human lung cancers exhibiting reduced MGL expression. Thus, MGL appears to mediate its tumor-suppressive actions by inhibiting XIAP to induce cell death.

32332916	Although the roles of the Hippo pathway in organogenesis and tumorigenesis have been well studied in multiple organs, its role in sperm maturation and male fertility has not been investigated. The initial segment (IS) of the epididymis plays a critical role in sperm maturation. IS differentiation is governed by ERK1/2, but the mechanisms of ERK1/2 activation in IS are not fully understood. Here we show that double knockout (dKO) of mammalian sterile 20-like kinases 1 and 2 (Mst1 and Mst2), homologs of Hippo in Drosophila, in the epididymal epithelium led to male infertility in mice. Sperm in the cauda epididymides of mutant mice were immotile with flagellar angulation and severely disorganized structures. Loss of Mst1/2 activated YAP and increased proliferation and cell death in all the segments of epididymis. The mutant mice showed substantially suppressed MEK/ERK signaling in the IS and failed IS differentiation. Deletion of Yap restored the reduced MEK/ERK signaling, and partially rescued the defective IS differentiation and fertility in Mst1/2 dKO mice. Our results demonstrate that YAP inhibits the MEK/ERK pathway in IS epithelial cells, and MST1/2 control IS differentiation and fertility at least partially by repressing YAP. Taken together, the Hippo pathway is essential for sperm maturation and male fertility.	Hippo kinases MST1 and MST2 control the differentiation of the epididymal initial segment via the MEK-ERK pathway.	Cell death and differentiation	1
32494026	ATR is a master regulator of cell response to replication stress. Adequate activation of ATR is essential for preventing genome aberrance induced by replication defect. However, the mechanism underlying ATR activation is not fully understood. Here, we identify that RBMX is an ssDNA binding protein that orchestrates a novel pathway to activate ATR. Using super-resolution STORM, we observe that RBMX and RPA bind to adjacent but nonoverlapping sites on ssDNA in response to replication stress. RBMX then binds to and facilitates positioning of TopBP1, which activates nearby ATR associated with RPA. In addition, ATR activation by ssDNA-RBMX-TopBP1 is independent of ssDNA-dsDNA junction and 9-1-1 complex. ChIP-seq analysis reveals that RBMX/RPA are highly enriched on repetitive DNAs, which are considered as fragile sites with high replication stress. RBMX depletion leads to defective localization of TopBP1 to replication stressed sites and inadequate activation of ATR. Furthermore, cells with deficient RBMX demonstrate replication defect, leading to formation of micronuclei and a high rate of sister-chromatin exchange, indicative of genome instability. Together, the results identify a new ssDNA-RBMX-TopBP1 pathway that is specifically required for activation of ATR on repetitive DNAs. Therefore, RBMX is a key factor to ensure genome stability during replication.	RBMX is required for activation of ATR on repetitive DNAs to maintain genome stability.	Cell death and differentiation	0
32483381	Posttranslational modifications of nuclear proteins, including transcription factors, nuclear receptors, and their coregulators, have attracted much attention in cancer research. Although phosphorylation of oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (Olig2) may contribute to the notorious resistance of gliomas to radiation and genotoxic drugs, the precise mechanisms remain elusive. We show here that in addition to phosphorylation, Olig2 is also conjugated by small ubiquitin-like modifier-1 (SUMO1) at three lysine residues K27, K76, and K112. SUMOylation is required for Olig2 to suppress p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by genotoxic damage, and to enhance resistance to temozolomide (TMZ) in glioma. Both SUMOylation and triple serine motif (TSM) phosphorylation of Olig2 are required for the antiapoptotic function. Olig2 SUMOylation enhances its genetic targeting ability, which in turn occludes p53 recruitment to Cdkn1a promoter for DNA-damage responses. Our work uncovers a SUMOylation-dependent regulatory mechanism of Olig2 in regulating cancer survival.	Olig2 SUMOylation protects against genotoxic damage response by antagonizing p53 gene targeting.

32587379	Despite recent advances in our understanding of the function of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), their roles and functions in DNA repair pathways remain poorly understood. By screening a panel of uncharacterized lncRNAs to identify those whose transcription is induced by double-strand breaks (DSBs), we identified a novel lncRNA referred to as LRIK that interacts with Ku, which enhances the ability of the Ku heterodimer to detect the presence of DSBs. Here, we show that depletion of LRIK generates significantly enhanced sensitivity to DSB-inducing agents and reduced DSB repair efficiency. In response to DSBs, LRIK enhances the recruitment of repair factors at DSB sites and facilitates gammaH2AX signaling. Our results demonstrate that LRIK is necessary for efficient repairing DSBs via nonhomologous end-joining pathway.	LRIK interacts with the Ku70-Ku80 heterodimer enhancing the efficiency of NHEJ repair.	Cell death and differentiation	0
32555450	Brpf-histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes have important roles in embryonic development and regulating differentiation in ESCs. Among Brpf family, Brpf3 is a scaffold protein of Myst2 histone acetyltransferase complex that plays crucial roles in gene regulation, DNA replication, development as well as maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, its biological functions in ESCs are not elucidated. In this study, we find out that Brpf3 protein level is critical for Myst2 stability and E3 ligase Huwe1 functions as a novel negative regulator of Myst2 via ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Importantly, Brpf3 plays an antagonistic role in Huwe1-mediated degradation of Myst2, suggesting that protein-protein interaction between Brpf3 and Myst2 is required for retaining Myst2 stability. Further, Brpf3 overexpression causes the aberrant upregulation of Myst2 protein levels which in turn induces the dysregulated cell-cycle progression and also delay of early embryonic development processes such as embryoid-body formation and lineage commitment of mouse ESCs. The Brpf3 overexpression-induced phenotypes can be reverted by Huwe1 overexpression. Together, these results may provide novel insights into understanding the functions of Brpf3 in proper differentiation as well as cell-cycle progression of ESCs via regulation of Myst2 stability by obstructing Huwe1-mediated ubiquitination. In addition, we suggest that this is a useful report which sheds light on the function of an unknown gene in ESC field.

32908202	Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-binding protein, tau, and typically feature axon impairment and synaptic dysfunction. Cyclin-dependent kinase5 (Cdk5) is a major tau kinase and its activity requires p35 or p25 regulatory subunits. P35 is subjected to rapid proteasomal degradation in its membrane-bound form and is cleaved by calpain under stress to a stable p25 form, leading to aberrant Cdk5 activation and tau hyperphosphorylation. The type Ib transmembrane protein RPS23RG1 has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, physiological and pathological roles for RPS23RG1 in AD and other tauopathies are largely unclear. Herein, we observed retarded axon outgrowth, elevated p35 and p25 protein levels, and increased tau phosphorylation at major Cdk5 phosphorylation sites in Rps23rg1 knockout (KO) mice. Both downregulation of p35 and the Cdk5 inhibitor roscovitine attenuated tau hyperphosphorylation and axon outgrowth impairment in Rps23rg1 KO neurons. Interestingly, interactions between the RPS23RG1 carboxyl-terminus and p35 amino-terminus promoted p35 membrane distribution and proteasomal degradation. Moreover, P301L tau transgenic (Tg) mice showed increased tau hyperphosphorylation with reduced RPS23RG1 levels and impaired axon outgrowth. Overexpression of RPS23RG1 markedly attenuated tau hyperphosphorylation and axon outgrowth defects in P301L tau Tg neurons. Our results demonstrate the involvement of RPS23RG1 in tauopathy disorders, and implicate a role for RPS23RG1 in inhibiting tau hyperphosphorylation through homeostatic p35 degradation and suppression of Cdk5 activation. Reduced RPS23RG1 levels in tauopathy trigger aberrant Cdk5-p35 activation, consequent tau hyperphosphorylation, and axon outgrowth impairment, suggesting that RPS23RG1 may be a potential therapeutic target in tauopathy disorders.

32764647	Lysosome is a crucial organelle in charge of degrading proteins and damaged organelles to maintain cellular homeostasis. Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is the master transcription factor regulating lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. Under external stimuli such as starvation, dephosphorylated TFEB transports into the nucleus to specifically recognize and bind to the coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) elements at the promotors of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis-related genes. The function of TFEB in the nucleus is fine regulated but the molecular mechanism is not fully elucidated. In this study, we discovered that miR-30b-5p, a small RNA which is known to regulate a series of genes through posttranscriptional regulation in the cytoplasm, was translocated into the nucleus, bound to the CLEAR elements, suppressed the transcription of TFEB-dependent downstream genes, and further inhibited the lysosomal biogenesis and the autophagic flux; meanwhile, knocking out the endogenous miR-30b-5p by CRISPR/Cas9 technique significantly increased the TFEB-mediated transactivation, resulting in the increased expression of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis-related genes. Overexpressing miR-30b-5p in mice livers showed a decrease in lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. These in vitro and in vivo data indicate that miR-30b-5p may inhibit the TFEB-dependent transactivation by binding to the CLEAR elements in the nucleus to regulate the lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. This novel mechanism of nuclear miRNA regulating gene transcription is conducive to further elucidating the roles of miRNAs in the lysosomal physiological functions and helps to understand the pathogenesis of abnormal autophagy-related diseases.

32694652	p53 plays a pivotal role in controlling the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by regulating genes involved in cell cycle and early steps of differentiation process. In the context of osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and bone homeostasis, the osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand/receptor activator of NF-kappaB (OPG/RANKL/RANK) axis is a critical signaling pathway. The absence or loss of function of p53 has been implicated in aberrant osteogenic differentiation of MSCs that results in higher bone formation versus erosion, leading to an unbalanced bone remodeling. Here, we show by microCT that mice with p53 deletion systemically or specifically in mesenchymal cells possess significantly higher bone density than their respective littermate controls. There is a negative correlation between p53 and OPG both in vivo by analysis of serum from p53(+/+), p53(+/-), and p53(-/-) mice and in vitro by p53 knockdown and ChIP assay in MSCs. Notably, high expression of Opg or its combination with low level of p53 are prominent features in clinical cancer lesion of osteosarcoma and prostate cancer respectively, which correlate with poor survival. Intra-bone marrow injection of prostate cancer cells, together with androgen can suppress p53 expression and enhance local Opg expression, leading to an enhancement of bone density. Our results support the notion that MSCs, as osteoblast progenitor cells and one major component of bone microenvironment, represent a cellular source of OPG, whose amount is regulated by the p53 status. It also highlights a key role for the p53-OPG axis in regulating the cancer associated bone remodeling.

32968199	ATP-binding cassette transporters A1 (ABCA1) and G1 (ABCG1) play a vital role in promoting cholesterol efflux. Although, the dysregulation of these transporters was attributed as one of the mechanisms of atherogenesis, what renders their dysfunction is not well explored. Previously, we have reported that thrombin without having any effect on ABCG1 levels depletes ABCA1 levels affecting cholesterol efflux. In this study, we explored the mechanisms underlying thrombin-induced depletion of ABCA1 levels both in macrophages and smooth muscle cells. Under normal physiological conditions, COP9 signalosome subunit 3 (CSN3) was found to exist in complex with ABCA1 and in the presence of proatherogenic stimulants such as thrombin, ABCA1 was phosphorylated and dissociated from CSN3, leading to its degradation. Forced expression of CSN3 inhibited thrombin-induced ABCA1 ubiquitination and degradation, restored cholesterol efflux and suppressed foam cell formation. In Western diet (WD)-fed ApoE(-/-) mice, CSN3 was also disassociated from ABCA1 otherwise remained as a complex in Chow diet (CD)-fed ApoE(-/-) mice. Interestingly, depletion of CSN3 levels in WD-fed ApoE(-/-) mice significantly lowered ABCA1 levels, inhibited cholesterol efflux and intensified foam cell formation exacerbating the lipid laden atherosclerotic plaque formation. Mechanistic studies have revealed the involvement of Par1-Galpha12-Pyk2-Gab1-PKCtheta signaling in triggering phosphorylation of ABCA1 and its disassociation from CSN3 curtailing cholesterol efflux and amplifying foam cell formation. In addition, although both CSN3 and ABCA1 were found to be colocalized in human non-lesion coronary arteries, their levels were decreased as well as dissociated from each other in advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Together, these observations reveal for the first time an anti-atherogenic role of CSN3 and hence, designing therapeutic drugs protecting its interactions with ABCA1 could be beneficial against atherosclerosis.

32929218	The non-canonical inflammasome is an emerging crucial player in the development of inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. It is activated by direct sensing of cytosolic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by caspase-11 (CASP11), which then induces pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of regulated cell death. Here, we report that tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), a cytokine receptor-associated kinase, is a critical upstream regulator of CASP11. Absence of TYK2 or its kinase activity impairs the transcriptional induction of CASP11 in vitro and in vivo and protects mice from LPS-induced lethality. Lack of TYK2 or its enzymatic activity inhibits macrophage pyroptosis and impairs release of mature IL-1beta and IL-18 specifically in response to intracellular LPS. Deletion of TYK2 in myeloid cells reduces LPS-induced IL-1beta and IL-18 production in vivo, highlighting the importance of these cells in the inflammatory response to LPS. In support of our data generated with genetically engineered mice, pharmacological inhibition of TYK2 reduced LPS-induced upregulation of CASP11 in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and of its homolog CASP5 in human macrophages. Our study provides insights into the regulation of CASP11 in vivo and uncovered a novel link between TYK2 activity and CASP11-dependent inflammation.

32929216	Arginylation was previously found to promote stabilization of heat shock protein 70.3 (Hsp70.3) mRNA and cell survival in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) on exposure to heat stress (HS). In search of a factor responsible for these phenomena, the current study identified human antigen R (HuR) as a direct target of arginylation. HS induced arginylation of HuR affected its stability and RNA binding activity. Arginylated HuR failed to bind Hsp70.3 3' UTR, allowing the recruitment of cleavage stimulating factor 64 (CstF64) in the proximal poly-A-site (PAS), generating transcripts with short 3'UTR. However, HuR from Ate1 knock out (KO) MEFs bound to proximal PAS region with higher affinity, thus excluded CstF64 recruitment. This inhibited the alternative polyadenylation (APA) of Hsp70.3 mRNA and generated the unstable transcripts with long 3'UTR. The inhibition of RNA binding activity of HuR was traced to arginylation-coupled phosphorylation of HuR, by check point kinase 2 (Chk2). Arginylation of HuR occurred at the residue D15 and the arginylation was needed for the phosphorylation. Accumulation of HuR also decreased cell viability upon HS. In conclusion, arginylation dependent modifications of HuR maintained its cellular homeostasis, and promoted APA of Hsp70.3 pre-mRNA, during early HS response.	Heat stress induced arginylation of HuR promotes alternative polyadenylation of Hsp70.3 by regulating HuR stability and RNA binding.	Cell death and differentiation	0
32913227	Increasing evidence suggests that miRNAs play important regulatory roles in the nervous system. However, the molecular mechanisms of how specific miRNAs affect neuronal development and functions remain less well understood. In the present study, we provide evidence that the conserved microRNA miR-210 regulates lipid metabolism and prevents neurodegeneration in the Drosophila retina. miR-210 is specifically expressed in the photoreceptor neurons and other sensory organs. Genetic deletion of miR-210 leads to lipid droplet accumulation and photoreceptor degeneration in the retina. These effects are associated with abnormal activation of the Drosophila sterol regulatory element-binding protein signaling. We further identify the acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase (ACS) as one functionally important target of miR-210 in this context. Reduction of ACS in the miR-210 mutant background suppresses the neurodegeneration defects, suggesting that miR-210 acts through regulation of the ACS transcript. Together, these results reveal an unexpected role of miR-210 in controlling lipid metabolism and neuronal functions.

32895487	Oct4 plays a crucial role in the regulation of self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying posttranslational regulation and protein stability of Oct4 remain unclear. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified Kap1 as an Oct4-binding protein. Silencing of Kap1 reduced the protein levels of Oct4 in ESCs, whereas the overexpression of Kap1 stimulated the levels of Oct4. In addition, Kap1 overexpression stimulated the self-renewal of ESCs and attenuated the spontaneous differentiation of ESCs in response to LIF withdrawal. Kap1 overexpression increased the stability of Oct4 by inhibiting the Itch-mediated ubiquitination of Oct4. Silencing of Kap1 augmented Itch-mediated ubiquitination and inhibited the stability of Oct4. We identified the lysine 133 (K133) residue in Oct4 as a ubiquitination site responsible for the Kap1-Itch-dependent regulation of Oct4 stability. Preventing ubiquitination at the lysine residue by mutation to arginine augmented the reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells. These results suggest that Kap1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of the pluripotency of ESCs and somatic cell reprogramming by preventing Itch-mediated ubiquitination and the subsequent degradation of Oct4.

33087875	Selective autophagic degradation of mitochondria (mitophagy) is important in maintaining proper cellular homeostasis. Here, we found that SPATA33 is a novel autophagy mediator for mitophagy in testis. The SPATA33 protein localizes on mitochondria via its binding of the carboxyl terminal with the outer mitochondrial membrane protein VDAC2. Upon starvation induction, SPATA33 is recruited to autophagosome by binding the autophagy machinery ATG16L1 via its N-terminal along with mitochondria. Notably, Spata33 knockout inhibited autophagy and overexpression can promote autophagosome formation for mitochondrial sequestration. Therefore, SPATA33 confers selectivity for mitochondrial degradation and promotes mitophagy in male germline cells.	SPATA33 is an autophagy mediator for cargo selectivity in germline mitophagy.

33082516	CIB1 is a homolog of calmodulin that regulates cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation. It has been considered as an oncogene in many tumor cells; however, its role in lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) has not been studied. In this study, the expression levels of CIB1 in LAC tissues and adjacent normal tissues were examined by immunohistochemistry, and the relationship between CIB1 expression and patient clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed. The effects of CIB1 on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, and metastasis of LAC cells were determined in vitro and vivo. Proteins interacting with CIB1 were identified using electrospray mass spectrometry (LS-MS), and CHIP was selected in the following assays. Carboxyl-terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP) is a ubiquitin E3 ligase. We show that CHIP can degrade CIB1 via promoting polyubiquitination of CIB1 and its subsequent proteasomal degradation. Besides, lysine residue 10 and 65 of CIB1 is the ubiquitinated site of CIB1. Furthermore, CHIP-mediated CIB1 downregulation is critical for the suppression of metastasis and migration of LAC. These results indicated that CHIP-mediated CIB1 ubiquitination could regulate epithelial-mesenchymal and tumor metastasis in LAC.

33082514	Cancer cells undergo complex metabolic alterations. The mechanisms underlying the tuning of cancer metabolism are under active investigation. Here, we identify the uncharacterized deubiquitinase JOSD2 as a positive regulator of cancer cell proliferation by displaying comprehensive effects on glucose catabolism. We found that JOSD2 directly controls a metabolic enzyme complex that includes Aldolase A, Phosphofructokinase-1 and Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, in vitro and in vivo. Further, JOSD2 expression, but not a catalytically inactive mutant, deubiquitinates and stabilizes the enzyme complex, thereby enhancing their activities and the glycolytic rate. This represents a selective JOSD2 feature that is not shared among other Machado-Joseph disease DUBs or observed in nontransformed cells. JOSD2 deficiency displays cytostatic effects and reduces glycolysis in a broad spectrum of tumor cells of distinct origin and its expression correlates with poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer. Overall, our study provides evidence for a previously unknown biological mechanism in which JOSD2 integrates glucose and serine metabolism with potential therapeutic implications.

33024274	Development of renal fibrosis is a hallmark of renal aging and chronic kidney disease of all etiologies and characterized by extensive renal cell injuries and subsequent myofibroblast transdifferentiations (MTDs), which are significantly influenced by aberrant histone deacetylase (HDAC) activities. However, the key HDAC isoforms and effectors that are causally involved in the processes remain poorly understood. Here, we report that aberrant HDAC3 induction and its inhibition of Klotho, a renal epithelium-enriched aging suppressor, contribute significantly to renal fibrogenesis. HDAC3 was preferentially elevated with concomitant Klotho suppression in fibrotic kidneys incurred by unilateral ureter obstruction (UUO) and aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN), whereas Hdac3 knockout resisted the fibrotic pathologies. The HDAC3 elevation is substantially blocked by the inhibitors of TGFbeta receptor and Smad3 phosphorylation, suggesting that TGFbeta/Smad signal activates Hdac3 transcription. Consistently, an HDAC3-selective inhibitor RGFP966 derepressed Klotho and mitigated the renal fibrotic injuries in both UUO and AAN mice. Further, HDAC3 overexpression or inhibition in renal epithelia inversely affected Klotho abundances and HDAC3 was inducibly associated with transcription regulators NCoR and NF-kB and bound to Klotho promoter in fibrotic kidney, supporting that aberrant HDAC3 targets and transcriptionally inhibits Klotho under renal fibrotic conditions. More importantly, the antirenal fibrosis effects of RGFP966 were largely compromised in mice with siRNA-mediated Klotho knockdown. Hence, HDAC3 aberration and the subsequent Klotho suppression constitute an important regulatory loop that promotes MTD and renal fibrosis and uses of HDAC3-selective inhibitors are potentially effective in treating renal fibrotic disorders.

32999468	Receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1; RIPK1) is a key regulator of multiple signaling pathways that mediate inflammatory responses and cell death. TNF-TNFR1 triggered signaling complex formation, subsequent NF-kappaB and MAPK activation and induction of cell death involve RIPK1 ubiquitination at several lysine residues including Lys376 and Lys115. Here we show that mutating the ubiquitination site K376 of RIPK1 (K376R) in mice activates cell death resulting in embryonic lethality. In contrast to Ripk1(K376R/K376R) mice, Ripk1(K115R/K115R) mice reached adulthood and showed slightly higher responsiveness to TNF-induced death. Cell death observed in Ripk1(K376R/K376R) embryos relied on RIPK1 kinase activity as administration of RIPK1 inhibitor GNE684 to pregnant heterozygous mice effectively blocked cell death and prolonged survival. Embryonic lethality of Ripk1(K376R/K376R) mice was prevented by the loss of TNFR1, or by simultaneous deletion of caspase-8 and RIPK3. Interestingly, elimination of the wild-type allele from adult Ripk1(K376R/cko) mice was tolerated. However, adult Ripk1(K376R/cko) mice were exquisitely sensitive to TNF-induced hypothermia and associated lethality. Absence of the K376 ubiquitination site diminished K11-linked, K63-linked, and linear ubiquitination of RIPK1, and promoted the assembly of death-inducing cellular complexes, suggesting that multiple ubiquitin linkages contribute to the stability of the RIPK1 signaling complex that stimulates NF-kappaB and MAPK activation. In contrast, mutating K115 did not affect RIPK1 ubiquitination or TNF stimulated NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling. Overall, our data indicate that selective impairment of RIPK1 ubiquitination can lower the threshold for RIPK1 activation by TNF resulting in cell death and embryonic lethality.

32989241	Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) exhibits poor prognosis due to local recurrence, metastasis, and resistance to targeted therapies. Using clinicopathological analyses of GBC patients along with molecular in vitro and tumor in vivo analysis of GBC cells, we showed that reduction of Dsg2 expression was highly associated with higher T stage, more perineural, and lymphatic invasion. Dsg2-depleted GBC cells exhibited significantly enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasiveness in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo through Src-mediated signaling activation. Interestingly, Dsg2 binding inhibited Src activation, whereas its loss activated cSrc-mediated EGFR plasma membrane clearance and cytoplasmic localization, which was associated with acquired EGFR-targeted therapy resistance and decreased overall survival. Inhibition of Src activity by dasatinib enhanced therapeutic response to anti-EGFR therapy. Dsg2 status can help stratify predicted patient response to anti-EGFR therapy and Src inhibition could be a promising strategy to improve the clinical efficacy of EGFR-targeted therapy.

33288902	Adult mammalian cardiomyocytes (CM) are postmitotic, differentiated cells that cannot re-enter the cell cycle after any appreciable injury. Therefore, understanding the factors required to induce CM proliferation for repair is of great clinical importance. While expression of muscle pyruvate kinase 2 (Pkm2), a cytosolic enzyme catalyzing the final step in glycolysis, is high in end-stage heart failure (HF), the loss of Pkm2 promotes proliferation in some cellular systems, in vivo. We hypothesized that in the adult heart CM proliferation may require low Pkm2 activity. Thus, we investigated the potential for Pkm2 to regulate CM proliferation in a mouse model of myocardial infarction (MI) employing inducible, cardiac-specific Pkm2 gene knockout (Pkm2KOi) mice. We found a lack of cardiac hypertrophy or expression of the fetal gene program in Pkm2KOi mice post MI, as compared to vehicle control animals (P < 0.01), correlating with smaller infarct size, improved mitochondrial (mt) function, enhanced angiogenesis, reduced degree of CM apoptosis, and reduced oxidative stress post MI. There was significantly higher numbers of dividing CM in the infarct zone between 3-9 days post MI (P < 0.001). Mechanistically, we determined that Pkm2 interacts with beta-catenin (Ctnnb1) in the cytoplasm of CM, inhibiting Ctnnb1 phosphorylation at serine 552 and tyrosine 333, by Akt. In the absence of Pkm2, Ctnnb1 translocates to the nucleus leading to transcriptional activation of proliferation-associated target genes. All these effects are abrogated by genetic co-deletion of Pkm2 and Ctnnb1. Collectively, this work supports a novel antiproliferative function for Pkm2 in CM through the sequestration of Ctnnb1 in the cytoplasm of CM whereas loss of Pkm2 is essential for CM proliferation. Reducing cardiac Pkm2 expression may provide a useful strategy for cardiac repair after MI in patients.

33110216	Hepatic ischemic reperfusion injury (IRI) is a common complication of liver surgery. Although an imbalance between mitochondrial fission and fusion has been identified as the cause of IRI, the detailed mechanism remains unclear. Augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR) was reported to prevent mitochondrial fission by inhibiting dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) phosphorylation, contributing partially to its liver protection. Apart from phosphorylation, Drp1 activity is also regulated by small ubiquitin-like modification (SUMOylation), which accelerates mitochondrial fission. This study aimed to investigate whether ALR-mediated protection from hepatic IRI might be associated with an effect on Drp1 SUMOylation. Liver tissues were harvested from both humans and from heterozygous ALR knockout mice, which underwent IRI. The SUMOylation and phosphorylation of Drp1 and their modulation by ALR were investigated. Hepatic Drp1 SUMOylation was significantly increased in human transplanted livers and IRI-livers of mice. ALR-transfection significantly decreased Drp1 SUMOylation, attenuated the IRI-induced mitochondrial fission and preserved mitochondrial stability and function. This study showed that the binding of transcription factor Yin Yang-1 (YY1) to its downstream target gene UBA2, a subunit of SUMO-E1 enzyme heterodimer, was critical to control Drp1 SUMOylation. By interacting with YY1, ALR inhibits its nuclear import and dramatically decreases the transcriptional level of UBA2. Consequently, mitochondrial fission was significantly reduced, and mitochondrial function was maintained. This study showed that the regulation of Drp1 SUMOylation by ALR protects mitochondria from fission, rescuing hepatocytes from IRI-induced apoptosis. These new findings provide a potential target for clinical intervention to reduce the effects of IRI during hepatic surgery.

33097833	Ferroptosis, a form of iron-dependent cell death driven by cellular metabolism and iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, has been implicated as a tumor-suppressor function for cancer therapy. Recent advance revealed that the sensitivity to ferroptosis is tightly linked to numerous biological processes, including metabolism of amino acid and the biosynthesis of glutathione. Here, by using a high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screen in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells to search for metabolic proteins inhibiting ferroptosis, we identified a branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase 2 (BCAT2) as a novel suppressor of ferroptosis. Mechanistically, ferroptosis inducers (erastin, sorafenib, and sulfasalazine) activated AMPK/SREBP1 signaling pathway through iron-dependent ferritinophagy, which in turn inhibited BCAT2 transcription. We further confirmed that BCAT2 as the key enzyme mediating the metabolism of sulfur amino acid, regulated intracellular glutamate level, whose activation by ectopic expression specifically antagonize system Xc(-) inhibition and protected liver and pancreatic cancer cells from ferroptosis in vitro and in vivo. On the contrary, direct inhibition of BCAT2 by RNA interference, or indirect inhibition by blocking system Xc(-) activity, triggers ferroptosis. Finally, our results demonstrate the synergistic effect of sorafenib and sulfasalazine in downregulating BCAT2 expression and dictating ferroptotic death, where BCAT2 can also be used to predict the responsiveness of cancer cells to ferroptosis-inducing therapies. Collectively, these findings identify a novel role of BCAT2 in ferroptosis, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for overcoming sorafenib resistance.

33288903	Foxo1 transcription factor is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of cell metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Activation of Hedgehog/Gli signaling is known to regulate cell growth, differentiation, and immune function. However, the molecular mechanisms by which interactive cell signaling networks restrain oxidative stress response and necroptosis are still poorly understood. Here, we report that myeloid-specific Foxo1 knockout (Foxo1(M-KO)) mice were resistant to oxidative stress-induced hepatocellular damage with reduced macrophage/neutrophil infiltration, and proinflammatory mediators in liver ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). Foxo1(M-KO) enhanced beta-catenin-mediated Gli1/Snail activity, and reduced receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and NIMA-related kinase 7 (NEK7)/NLRP3 expression in IR-stressed livers. Disruption of Gli1 in Foxo1(M-KO) livers deteriorated liver function, diminished Snail, and augmented RIPK3 and NEK7/NLRP3. Mechanistically, macrophage Foxo1 and beta-catenin colocalized in the nucleus, whereby the Foxo1 competed with T-cell factor (TCF) for interaction with beta-catenin under inflammatory conditions. Disruption of the Foxo1-beta-catenin axis by Foxo1 deletion enhanced beta-catenin/TCF binding, activated Gli1/Snail signaling, leading to inhibited RIPK3 and NEK7/NLRP3. Furthermore, macrophage Gli1 or Snail knockout activated RIPK3 and increased hepatocyte necroptosis, while macrophage RIPK3 ablation diminished NEK7/NLRP3-driven inflammatory response. Our findings underscore a novel molecular mechanism of the myeloid Foxo1-beta-catenin axis in regulating Hedgehog/Gli1 function that is key in oxidative stress-induced liver inflammation and necroptosis.

33273695	The receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is a key mediator of regulated cell death and inflammation. Recent studies suggest that RIPK1 inhibition would fundamentally improve the therapy of RIPK1-dependent organ damage in stroke, myocardial infarction, kidney failure, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Additionally, it could ameliorate or prevent multi-organ failure induced by cytokine release in the context of hyperinflammation, as seen in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we searched for a RIPK1 inhibitor and present the aromatic antiepileptic and FDA-approved drug primidone (Liskantin(R)) as a potent inhibitor of RIPK1 activation in vitro and in a murine model of TNFalpha-induced shock, which mimics the hyperinflammatory state of cytokine release syndrome. Furthermore, we detected for the first time RIPK1 activation in the respiratory tract epithelium of hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data provide a strong rationale for evaluating the drug primidone in conditions of hyperinflammation in humans.	Primidone blocks RIPK1-driven cell death and inflammation.

33686256	Although beta-arrestins (ARRBs) regulate diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes, their functions and regulation in Parkinson's disease (PD) remain poorly defined. In this study, we show that the expression of beta-arrestin 1 (ARRB1) and beta-arrestin 2 (ARRB2) is reciprocally regulated in PD mouse models, particularly in microglia. ARRB1 ablation ameliorates, whereas ARRB2 knockout aggravates, the pathological features of PD, including dopaminergic neuron loss, neuroinflammation and microglia activation in vivo, and microglia-mediated neuron damage in vitro. We also demonstrate that ARRB1 and ARRB2 produce adverse effects on inflammation and activation of the inflammatory STAT1 and NF-kappaB pathways in primary cultures of microglia and macrophages and that two ARRBs competitively interact with the activated form of p65, a component of the NF-kappaB pathway. We further find that ARRB1 and ARRB2 differentially regulate the expression of nitrogen permease regulator-like 3 (Nprl3), a functionally poorly characterized protein, as revealed by RNA sequencing, and that in the gain- and loss-of-function studies, Nprl3 mediates the functions of both ARRBs in microglia inflammatory responses. Collectively, these data demonstrate that two closely related ARRBs exert opposite functions in microglia-mediated inflammation and the pathogenesis of PD which are mediated at least in part through Nprl3 and provide novel insights into the understanding of the functional divergence of ARRBs in PD.

33462413	Caspase-8-cleaved Bid (cBid) associates with mitochondria and promotes the activation of BAX, leading to mitochondria outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and apoptosis. However, current structural models of cBid are largely based on studies using membrane vesicles and detergent micelles. Here we employ spin-label ESR and site-directed PEGylation methods to identify conformations of cBid at real mitochondrial membranes, revealing stepwise mechanisms in the activation process. Upon the binding of cBid to mitochondria, its structure is reorganized to expose the BH3 domain while leaving the structural integrity only slightly altered. The mitochondria-bound cBid is in association with Mtch2 and it remains in the primed state until interacting with BAX. The interaction subsequently triggers the fragmentation of cBid, causes large conformational changes, and promotes BAX-mediated MOMP. Our results reveal structural differences of cBid between mitochondria and other lipid-like environments and, moreover, highlight the role of the membrane binding in modifying cBid structure and assisting the inactive-to-active transition in function.

33462405	Ubiquitination by serving as a major degradation signal of proteins, but also by controlling protein functioning and localization, plays critical roles in most key cellular processes. Here, we show that MITF, the master transcription factor in melanocytes, controls ubiquitination in melanoma cells. We identified FBXO32, a component of the SCF E3 ligase complex as a new MITF target gene. FBXO32 favors melanoma cell migration, proliferation, and tumor development in vivo. Transcriptomic analysis shows that FBXO32 knockdown induces a global change in melanoma gene expression profile. These include the inhibition of CDK6 in agreement with an inhibition of cell proliferation and invasion upon FBXO32 silencing. Furthermore, proteomic analysis identifies SMARC4, a component of the chromatin remodeling complexes BAF/PBAF, as a FBXO32 partner. FBXO32 and SMARCA4 co-localize at loci regulated by FBXO32, such as CDK6 suggesting that FBXO32 controls transcription through the regulation of chromatin remodeling complex activity. FBXO32 and SMARCA4 are the components of a molecular cascade, linking MITF to epigenetics, in melanoma cells.	FBXO32 links ubiquitination to epigenetic reprograming of melanoma cells.

33664480	Osteoblast differentiation leading to bone formation requires a coordinated transcriptional program. Osteoblastic cells with low level of microtubule actin crosslinking factor 1 (MACF1) show reduced osteoblast differentiation ability, however, the comprehensive mechanism of MACF1's action remains unexplored. In the current study, we found that MACF1 knockdown suppressed osteoblast differentiation by altering the transcriptome dynamics. We further identified two MACF1-interacted proteins, cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) and MYST/Esa1-associated factor 6 (MEAF6), and two MACF1-interacted transcription factors (TFs), transcription factor 12 (TCF12) and E2F transcription factor 6 (E2F6), which repress osteoblast differentiation by altering the expression of osteogenic TFs and genes. Moreover, we found that MACF1 regulated cytoplasmic-nuclear localization of itself, TCF12 and E2F6 in a concentration-dependent manner. MACF1 oppositely regulates the expression of TCF12 and transcription factor 7 (TCF7), two TFs that drive osteoblast differentiation to opposite directions. This study reveals that MACF1, a cytoskeletal protein, acts as a sponge for repressors of osteoblast differentiation to promote osteoblast differentiation and contributes to a novel mechanistic insight of osteoblast differentiation and transcription dynamics.

33658703	Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the predominant subtype of esophageal cancer with a particularly high prevalence in certain geographical regions and a poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of 15-25%. Despite numerous studies characterizing the genetic and transcriptomic landscape of ESCC, there are currently no effective targeted therapies. In this study, we used an unbiased screening approach to uncover novel molecular precision oncology targets for ESCC and identified the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family member bromodomain testis-specific protein (BRDT) to be uniquely expressed in a subgroup of ESCC. Experimental studies revealed that BRDT expression promotes migration but is dispensable for cell proliferation. Further mechanistic insight was gained through transcriptome analyses, which revealed that BRDT controls the expression of a subset of DeltaNp63 target genes. Epigenome and genome-wide occupancy studies, combined with genome-wide chromatin interaction studies, revealed that BRDT colocalizes and interacts with DeltaNp63 to drive a unique transcriptional program and modulate cell phenotype. Our data demonstrate that these genomic regions are enriched for super-enhancers that loop to critical DeltaNp63 target genes related to the squamous phenotype such as KRT14, FAT2, and PTHLH. Interestingly, BET proteolysis-targeting chimera, MZ1, reversed the activation of these genes. Importantly, we observed a preferential degradation of BRDT by MZ1 compared with BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4. Taken together, these findings reveal a previously unknown function of BRDT in ESCC and provide a proof-of-concept that BRDT may represent a novel therapeutic target in cancer.

33762743	The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear, and there is no disease-modifying agent for PD. Withaferin A (WA), a naturally occurring compound, has emerged as a neuroprotective agent. However, the mechanisms by which WA is neuroprotective in PD are unknown. Here we show that WA protected against loss of dopaminergic neurons, neuroinflammation, and motor deficits in MPTP-induced PD mouse models. Whole-genome deep sequencing analysis combined with Meta-analysis of human PD studies reveal that DJ1, Nrf2, and STING in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are linked to anti-PD effect of WA. We found that WA activated DJ1 and Nrf2, and suppressed STING within SNc; and overexpression of STING in SNc dampened the effect of WA. Using genetically modified mice (DJ1-KO, Nrf2-KO, STING(gt/gt) and STING-KO) and immunolabeling technique, we identified that WA targeted DJ1-Nrf2-STING pathway in dopaminergic neurons; and we demonstrate that STING might be an important factor in PD pathogenesis. In addition, WA alleviated accumulation of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein (p-alpha-syn) and insoluble alpha-syn within SNc in adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated human alpha-syn overexpression PD model. Our comparative analysis on whole-genome transcriptome profiles suggests that STING might be a key target of WA and amantadine in PD treatment. This study highlights a multifaceted role for WA in neuroprotection, and suggests that WA can be a potential candidate for treatment of PD.

33664479	Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is a disease that causes severe blindness and is characterized by the formation of contractile fibrotic subretinal or epiretinal membranes. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is a hallmark of PVR. This work aims to examine the role of a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) named EMT-related lncRNA in RPE (ERLR, LINC01705-201 (ENST00000438158.1)) in PVR and to explore the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we found that ERLR is upregulated in RPE cells stimulated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 as detected by lncRNA microarray and RT-PCR. Further studies characterized full-length ERLR and confirmed that it is mainly expressed in the cytoplasm. In vitro, silencing ERLR in RPE cells attenuated TGF-beta1-induced EMT, whereas overexpressing ERLR directly triggered EMT in RPE cells. In vivo, inhibiting ERLR in RPE cells reduced the ability of cells to induce experimental PVR. Mechanistically, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicated that the transcription factor TCF4 directly binds to the promoter region of ERLR and promotes its transcription. ERLR mediates EMT by directly binding to MYH9 protein and increasing its stability. TCF4 and MYH9 also mediate TGF-beta1-induced EMT in RPE cells. Furthermore, ERLR is also significantly increased in RPE cells incubated with vitreous PVR samples. In clinical samples of PVR membranes, ERLR was detected through fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and colocalized with the RPE marker pancytokeratin (pan-CK). These results indicated that lncRNA ERLR is involved in TGF-beta1-induced EMT of human RPE cells and that it is involved in PVR. This finding provides new insights into the mechanism and treatment of PVR.

34040167	AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a critical sensor of energy status that coordinates cell growth with energy balance. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) the role of AMPKalpha is controversial and its contribution to lung carcinogenesis is not well-defined. Furthermore, it remains largely unknown whether long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the regulation of AMPK-mediated pathways. Here, we found that loss of AMPKalpha in combination with activation of mutant KRAS(G12D) increased lung tumour burden and reduced survival in Kras(LSLG12D/+)/AMPKalpha(fl/fl) mice. In agreement, functional in vitro studies revealed that AMPKalpha silencing increased growth and migration of NSCLC cells. In addition, we identified an AMPKalpha-modulated lncRNA, KIMAT1 (ENSG00000228709), which in turn regulates AMPKalpha activation by stabilizing the lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB). Collectively, our study indicates that AMPKalpha loss promotes KRAS-mediated lung tumorigenesis and proposes a novel KRAS/KIMAT1/LDHB/AMPKalpha axis that could be exploited for therapeutic purposes.

33986463	Here, we provide evidence that high ATP production by the mitochondrial ATP-synthase is a new therapeutic target for anticancer therapy, especially for preventing tumor progression. More specifically, we isolated a subpopulation of ATP-high cancer cells which are phenotypically aggressive and demonstrate increases in proliferation, stemness, anchorage-independence, cell migration, invasion and multi-drug resistance, as well as high antioxidant capacity. Clinically, these findings have important implications for understanding treatment failure and cancer cell dormancy. Using bioinformatic analysis of patient samples, we defined a mitochondrial-related gene signature for metastasis, which features the gamma-subunit of the mitochondrial ATP-synthase (ATP5F1C). The relationship between ATP5F1C protein expression and metastasis was indeed confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Next, we used MDA-MB-231 cells as a model system to functionally validate these findings. Importantly, ATP-high MDA-MB-231 cells showed a nearly fivefold increase in metastatic capacity in vivo. Consistent with these observations, ATP-high cells overexpressed (i) components of mitochondrial complexes I-V, including ATP5F1C, and (ii) markers associated with circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and metastasis, such as EpCAM and VCAM1. Knockdown of ATP5F1C expression significantly reduced ATP-production, anchorage-independent growth, and cell migration, as predicted. Similarly, therapeutic administration of the FDA-approved drug, Bedaquiline, downregulated ATP5F1C expression in vitro and prevented spontaneous metastasis in vivo. In contrast, Bedaquiline had no effect on the growth of non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) or primary tumors in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that mitochondrial ATP depletion is a new therapeutic strategy for metastasis prophylaxis, to avoid treatment failure. In summary, we conclude that mitochondrial ATP5F1C is a promising new biomarker and molecular target for future drug development, for the prevention of metastatic disease progression.	Bedaquiline, an FDA-approved drug, inhibits mitochondrial ATP production and metastasis in vivo, by targeting the gamma subunit (ATP5F1C) of the ATP synthase.	Cell death and differentiation	1
33879857	Chemokines are important regulators of the immune system, inducing specific cellular responses by binding to receptors on immune cells. In SLE patients, decreased expression of CCL2 on mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) prevents inhibition of B-cell proliferation, causing the characteristic autoimmune phenotype. Nevertheless, the intrinsic role of CCL2 on B-cell autoimmunity is unknown. In this study using Ccl2 KO mice, we found that CCL2 deficiency enhanced BCR signaling by upregulating the phosphorylation of the MST1-mTORC1-STAT1 axis, which led to reduced marginal zone (MZ) B cells and increased germinal center (GC) B cells. The abnormal differentiation of MZ and GC B cells were rescued by in vivo inhibition of mTORC1. Additionally, the inhibition of MST1-mTORC1-STAT1 with specific inhibitors in vitro also rescued the BCR signaling upon antigenic stimulation. The deficiency of CCL2 also enhanced the early activation of B cells including B-cell spreading, clustering and signalosome recruitment by upregulating the DOCK8-WASP-actin axis. Our study has revealed the intrinsic role and underlying molecular mechanism of CCL2 in BCR signaling, B-cell differentiation, and humoral response.

34226680	Junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) play a critical role in cell permeability, polarity and migration. JAM-A, a key protein of the JAM family, is altered in a number of conditions including cancer; however, consequences of JAM-A dysregulation on carcinogenesis appear to be tissue dependent and organ dependent with significant implications for the use of JAM-A as a biomarker or therapeutic target. Here, we test the expression and prognostic role of JAM-A downregulation in primary and metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) (n = 947). We show that JAM-A downregulation is observed in ~60% of CRC and correlates with poor outcome in four cohorts of stages II and III CRC (n = 1098). Using JAM-A knockdown, re-expression and rescue experiments in cell line monolayers, 3D spheroids, patient-derived organoids and xenotransplants, we demonstrate that JAM-A silencing promotes proliferation and migration in 2D and 3D cell models and increases tumour volume and metastases in vivo. Using gene-expression and proteomic analyses, we show that JAM-A downregulation results in the activation of ERK, AKT and ROCK pathways and leads to decreased bone morphogenetic protein 7 expression. We identify MIR21 upregulation as the cause of JAM-A downregulation and show that JAM-A rescue mitigates the effects of MIR21 overexpression on cancer phenotype. Our results identify a novel molecular loop involving MIR21 dysregulation, JAM-A silencing and activation of multiple oncogenic pathways in promoting invasiveness and metastasis in CRC.

32203167	Blockade of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) by therapeutic antibodies has shown to be a promising strategy in cancer therapy, yet clinical response in many types of cancer, including prostate cancer (PCa), is limited. Tumor cells secrete PD-L1 through exosomes or splice variants, which has been described as a new mechanism for the resistance to PD-L1 blockade therapy in multiple cancers, including PCa. This suggests that cutting off the secretion or expression of PD-L1 might improve the response rate of PD-L1 blockade therapy in PCa treatment. Here we report that p300/CBP inhibition by a small molecule p300/CBP inhibitor dramatically enhanced the efficacy of PD-L1 blockade treatment in a syngeneic model of PCa by blocking both the intrinsic and IFN-gamma-induced PD-L1 expression. Mechanistically, p300/CBP could be recruited to the promoter of CD274 (encoding PD-L1) by the transcription factor IRF-1, which induced the acetylation of Histone H3 at CD274 promoter followed by the transcription of CD274. A485, a p300/CBP inhibitor, abrogated this process and cut off the secretion of exosomal PD-L1 by blocking the transcription of CD274, which combined with the anti-PD-L1 antibody to reactivate T cells function for tumor attack. This finding reports a new mechanism of how cancer cells regulate PD-L1 expression through epigenetic factors and provides a novel therapeutic approach to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors treatment.	p300/CBP inhibition enhances the efficacy of programmed death-ligand 1 blockade treatment in prostate cancer.

32238882	Despite advances in the systemic treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma using immune checkpoint and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), the majority of stage IV melanoma patients eventually succumb to the disease. We have previously identified the transcription factor Sox10 as a crucial player in melanoma, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms mediating Sox10-dependent tumorigenesis remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we show that MEK and RAF inhibitors do not suppress levels of SOX10 protein in patient-derived cells in vitro, as well as in melanoma patients in vivo. In a search for pharmacological inhibitors of SOX10, we performed a mass spectrometry-based screen in human melanoma cells. Subsequent analysis revealed that SOX10 directly interacts with beta-catenin, which is a key mediator of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. We demonstrate that inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha/beta (GSK3alpha/beta) efficiently abrogate SOX10 protein in human melanoma cells in vitro and in melanoma mouse models in vivo. The mechanism of action of GSK3-mediated SOX10 suppression is transcription-independent and relies on the presence of a proteasome degradable form of beta-catenin. Taken together, we provide evidence that activation of canonical Wnt signaling has a profound effect on melanoma growth and is able to counteract Sox10-dependent melanoma maintenance both in vitro and in vivo.	Temporal activation of WNT/beta-catenin signaling is sufficient to inhibit SOX10 expression and block melanoma growth.	Oncogene	0
32291413	Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) secrete high levels of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) that contributes to the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). TGF-beta1 modulates the expression of L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM), but its role in tumour progression still remains controversial. To clarify L1 function in PDAC and cellular phenotypes, we performed L1CAM cell sorting, silencing and overexpression in several primary pancreatic cancer cells. PSCs silenced for TGF-beta1 were used for crosstalk experiments. We found that TGF-beta1 secreted by PSCs negatively regulates L1CAM expression, through canonical TGF-beta-Smad2/3 signalling, leading to a more aggressive PDAC phenotype. Cells with reduced expression of L1CAM harboured enhanced stemness potential and tumourigenicity. Inactivation of TGF-beta1 signalling in PSCs strongly reduced the aggressiveness of PDAC cells. Our data provide functional proof and mechanistic insights for the tumour-suppressive function of L1CAM via reducing stemness. Rescuing L1CAM expression in cancer cells through targeting of TGF-beta1 reverses stemness and bears the potential to improve the still miserable prognosis of PDAC patients.

32251364	Impaired neuronal differentiation is a feature of neuroblastoma tumorigenesis, and the differentiation grade of neuroblastoma tumors is associated with patient prognosis. Detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying neuroblastoma differentiation will facilitate the development of effective treatment strategies. Recent studies have shown that myelin transcription factor 1 (MYT1) promotes vertebrate neurogenesis by regulating gene expression. We performed quantitative analysis of neuroblastoma samples, which revealed that MYT1 was differentially expressed among neuroblastoma patients with different pathological diagnoses. Analysis of clinical data showed that MYT1 overexpression was associated with a significantly shorter 3-year overall survival rate and poor differentiation in neuroblastoma specimens. MYT1 knockdown inhibited proliferation and promoted the expression of multiple differentiation-associated proteins. Integrated omics data indicated that many genes involved in neuro-differentiation were regulated by MYT1. Interestingly, many of these genes are targets of the REST complex; therefore, we further identified the physical interaction of MYT1 with LSD1/CoREST. Depletion of LSD1 or inhibition of LSD1 by ORY-1001 decreased MYT1 expression, providing an alternative approach to target MYT1. Taken together, our results indicate that MYT1 significantly attenuates cell differentiation by interacting with the LSD1/CoREST complex. MYT1 is, therefore, a promising therapeutic target for enhancing the neurite-inducing effect of retinoic acid and for inhibiting the growth of neuroblastoma.

32350443	Activator protein (AP)-1 transcription factors are essential elements of the pro-oncogenic functions of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta)-SMAD signaling. Here we show that in multiple HER2+ and/or EGFR+ breast cancer cell lines these AP-1-dependent tumorigenic properties of TGFbeta critically rely on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation and expression of the DeltaN isoform of transcriptional regulator p63. EGFR and DeltaNp63 enabled and/or potentiated the activation of a subset of TGFbeta-inducible invasion/migration-associated genes, e.g., ITGA2, LAMB3, and WNT7A/B, and enhanced the recruitment of SMAD2/3 to these genes. The TGFbeta- and EGF-induced binding of SMAD2/3 and JUNB to these gene loci was accompanied by p63-SMAD2/3 and p63-JUNB complex formation. p63 and EGFR were also found to strongly potentiate TGFbeta induction of AP-1 proteins and, in particular, FOS family members. Ectopic overexpression of FOS could counteract the decrease in TGFbeta-induced gene activation after p63 depletion. p63 is also involved in the transcriptional regulation of heparin binding (HB)-EGF and EGFR genes, thereby establishing a self-amplification loop that facilitates and empowers the pro-invasive functions of TGFbeta. These cooperative pro-oncogenic functions of EGFR, AP-1, p63, and TGFbeta were efficiently inhibited by clinically relevant chemical inhibitors. Our findings may, therefore, be of importance for therapy of patients with breast cancers with an activated EGFR-RAS-RAF pathway.

32332923	In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), response to platinum (PT)-based chemotherapy dictates subsequent treatments and predicts patients' prognosis. Alternative splicing is often deregulated in human cancers and can be altered by chemotherapy. Whether and how changes in alternative splicing regulation could impact on the response of EOC to PT-based chemotherapy is still not clarified. We identified the splicing factor proline and glutamine rich (SFPQ) as a critical mediator of response to PT in an unbiased functional genomic screening in EOC cells and, using a large cohort of primary and recurrent EOC samples, we observed that it is frequently overexpressed in recurrent PT-treated samples and that its overexpression correlates with PT resistance. At mechanistic level, we show that, under PT treatment, SFPQ, in complex with p54(nrb), binds and regulates the activity of the splicing factor SRSF2. SFPQ/p54(nrb) complex decreases SRSF2 binding to caspase-9 RNA, favoring the expression of its alternative spliced antiapoptotic form. As a consequence, SFPQ/p54(nrb) protects cells from PT-induced death, eventually contributing to chemoresistance. Overall, our work unveils a previously unreported SFPQ/p54(nrb)/SRSF2 pathway that in EOC cells plays a central role in regulating alternative splicing and PT-induced apoptosis and that could result in the design of new possible ways of intervention to overcome PT resistance.

32313225	Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women, largely due to the progression of a significant fraction of primary tumours to the metastatic stage. Here, we show that zinc-finger protein 750 (ZNF750) opposes the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells by repressing a prometastatic transcriptional programme, which includes genes involved in focal adhesion and extracellular matrix interactions, such as LAMB3 and CTNNAL1. Mechanistically, ZNF750 recruits the epigenetic modifiers KDM1A and HDAC1 to the promoter regions of LAMB3 and CTNNAL1, influencing histone marks and transactivating these genomic sites. Gene expression analysis in cancer patient datasets indicated that ZNF750 and its targets were negative prognostic factors in breast cancer. Together, our findings shed light on the molecular mechanism by which ZNF750 regulates cell migration and invasion, suggesting a role in breast cancer metastasis.

32393835	HER2 is overexpressed in 20-30% of all breast cancers and is associated with an invasive disease and poor clinical outcome. The Ste20-like kinase (SLK) is activated downstream of HER2/Neu and is required for efficient epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cell cycle progression, and migration in the mammary epithelium. Here we show that loss of SLK in a murine model of HER2/Neu-positive breast cancers significantly accelerates tumor onset and decreases overall survival. Transcriptional profiling of SLK knockout HER2/Neu-derived tumor cells revealed a strong induction in the triple-negative breast cancer marker, Sox10, accompanied by an increase in mammary stem/progenitor activity. Similarly, we demonstrate that SLK and Sox10 expression are inversely correlated in patient samples, with the loss of SLK and acquisition of Sox10 marking the triple-negative subtype. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of AKT reduces SLK-null tumor growth in vivo and is rescued by ectopic Sox10 expression, suggesting that Sox10 is a critical regulator of tumor growth downstream of SLK/AKT. These findings highlight a role for SLK in negatively regulating HER2-induced mammary tumorigenesis and provide mechanistic insight into the regulation of Sox10 expression in breast cancer.

32372061	Temozolomide (TMZ) insensitivity and resistance are major causes of treatment failure and poor prognosis for GBM patients. Here, we identify LRRC4 as a novel autophagy inhibitor that restores the sensitivity of GBMs to TMZ. LRRC4 was associated with the DEPTOR/mTOR complex, and this interaction resulted in autophagy inhibition. Further investigation demonstrated that the PDZ binding domain of LRRC4 binds to the PDZ domain of DEPTOR. This binding decreases the half-life of DEPTOR via ubiquitination, thus inhibiting GBM cell autophagy and increasing the TMZ treatment response of GBM. Combined LRRC4 expression and TMZ treatment prolonged the survival of mice with tumour xenografts. Furthermore, the levels of LRRC4, DEPTOR and autophagy are clinically relevant for GBM, indicating that LRRC4 is likely to have significant potential as a therapeutic marker and target for TMZ treatment in glioma patients.

32366908	Breast cancer (BC) is an aggressive cancer that is a leading cause of cancer-associated death in women worldwide. Although increased expression of heat shock protein 47 (HSP47), a collagen-specific chaperone, is associated with the high malignancy of BC, its role in BC remains largely unclear. Here we show that a small population of high-invasive BC cells expresses HSP47 and that HSP47-positive high-invasive BC cells have a high metastatic potential that is completely abolished by disruption of HSP47. HSP47 interacts with non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) via the unfolded protein response transducer IRE1alpha, resulting in enhancement of the metastatic potential of high-invasive BC cells by augmenting the contractile force of actin filaments. Ablation of NMIIA abrogates the metastatic potential of HSP47-positive high-invasive BC cells. We further show that forced expression of NMIIA confers a high metastatic potential on low-invasive BC cells in which HSP47 but not NMIIA is expressed. Overall, our study indicates that HSP47 acts as a stimulator for metastasis of BC cells and suggest that HSP47 may be a candidate for a therapeutic target against BC.

32398866	Klotho is a transmembrane protein, which can be shed and act as a circulating hormone and is involved in regulating cellular calcium levels and inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway. As a longevity hormone, it protects normal cells from oxidative stress, and as a tumor suppressor it inhibits growth of cancer cells. Mechanisms governing these differential activities have not been addressed. Altered cellular metabolism is a hallmark of cancer and dysregulation of mitochondrial activity is a hallmark of aging. We hypothesized that klotho exerts its differential effects through regulation of these two hallmarks. Treatment with klotho inhibited glycolysis, reduced mitochondrial activity and membrane potential only in cancer cells. Accordingly, global metabolic screen revealed that klotho altered pivotal metabolic pathways, amongst them glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle in breast cancer cells. Alteration of metabolic activity and increased AMP/ATP ratio lead to LKB1-dependent AMPK activation. Indeed, klotho induced AMPK phosphorylation; furthermore, inhibition of LKB1 partially abolished klotho's tumor suppressor activity. By diminishing deltapsi (Deltapsi) klotho also inhibited mitochondria Ca(2+) shuttling thereby impairing mitochondria communication with SOCE leading to reduced Ca(2+) influx by SOCE channels. The reduced SOCE was followed by ER Ca(2+) depletion and stress. These data delineate mechanisms mediating the differential effects of klotho toward cancer versus normal cells, and indicate klotho as a potent regulator of metabolic activity.

32439864	Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were demonstrated to play important roles in gene regulation and cancer progression. However, the functional roles of lncRNAs and the detailed mechanisms underlying gastric cancer (GC) progression remain largely unclear. Here, we identified a novel cancer-related lncRNA, termed lncRNA GCMA (Gastric Cancer metastasis-associated lncRNA), which was upregulated in GC tissues with lymph node metastasis (LNM) compared with tissues without LNM. High expression of GCMA was significantly associated with poor prognosis of patients with GC. Luciferase assays, bioinformatics analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicated that SP1 transcription factor directly bound to the GCMA promoter region and activated its transcription. Functionally, upregulation of GCMA dramatically promoted GC cells proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro, whereas knockdown of GCMA elicited the opposite function. Consistently, stable knockdown of GCMA inhibited tumor proliferation, invasion and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, by using bioinformatics analyses, RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays, luciferase assays and western-blot assays, GCMA was demonstrated to function as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) via competitively absorbing miR-124 and miR-34a to upregulate slug and snail, thereby induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and GC cell metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these results demonstrate that GCMA functions as an oncogenic lncRNA that may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker for GC and shed new lights on targeted therapy of GC in the future.

32439863	In response to nutrient deficiency, autophagy degrades cytoplasmic materials and organelles in lysosomes, which is nutrient recycling, whereas activation of EGFR mediates autophagy suppression in response to growth factors. It is unclear whether PPARdelta could be the regulator of autophagy in response to active EGFR. Here we found that EGFR induced PPARdelta phosphorylation at tyrosine-108 leading to increased binding of LC3 to PPARdelta by its LIR (LC3 interacting region) motif, consequently, inhibited autophagic flux. Conversely, EGFR inhibitor treatment reversed this event. Furthermore, EGFR-mediated PPARdelta phosphorylation at tyrosine-108 led to autophagy inhibition and tumor growth. These findings suggest that PPARdelta serves as a regulator of autophagy by its phosphorylation.	PPARdelta is a regulator of autophagy by its phosphorylation.	Oncogene	0
32514152	Bile acids (BAs), well-defined signaling molecules with diverse metabolic functions, play important roles in cellular processes associated with many cancers. As one of the most common BAs, deoxycholic acid (DCA) is originally synthesized in the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and processed in the gut. DCA plays crucial roles in various tumors; however, functions and molecular mechanisms of DCA in gallbladder cancer (GBC) still remain poorly characterized. Here, we analyzed human GBC samples and found that DCA was significantly downregulated in GBC, and reduced levels of DCA was associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with GBC. DCA treatment impeded tumor progression by halting cell proliferation. DCA decreased miR-92b-3p expression in an m(6)A-dependent posttranscriptional modification manner by facilitating dissociation of METTL3 from METTL3-METTL14-WTAP complex, which increased the protein level of the phosphatase and tensin homolog, a newly identified target of miR-92b-3p, and subsequently inactivated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Our findings revealed that DCA might function as a tumor suppressive factor in GBC at least by interfering with miR-92b-3p maturation, and suggested that DCA treatment could provide a new therapeutic strategy for GBC.

32518375	Guanylate-binding protein 2 (GBP2) is an interferon-inducible large GTPase which is crucial to the protective immunity against microorganisms. However, its biological function in cancer remains largely unknown. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and deadly brain tumor in adults. Here we show that GBP2 expression is highly elevated in GBM tumor and cell lines, particularly in those of the mesenchymal subtype. High GBP2 expression is associated with poor prognosis. GBP2 overexpression significantly promotes GBM cell migration and invasion in vitro, and GBP2 silencing by RNA interference exhibits opposite effects. We further show that fibronectin (FN1) is dramatically induced by GBP2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, and FN1 is essential for GBP2-promoted GBM invasiveness. Inhibition of Stat3 pathway prevents GBP2-promoted FN1 induction and cell invasion. Consistently, GBP2 dramatically promotes GBM tumor growth and invasion in mice and significantly reduces the survival time of the mice with tumor. Taken together, these findings establish the role of GBP2/Stat3/FN1 signaling cascade in GBM invasion and suggest GBP2 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for inhibiting GBM invasion.

32546724	Aberrant sphingolipid metabolism has been implicated in chemoresistance, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Herein we revealed a previously unrecognized mechanism of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance contributed by high SphK2-upregulated dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) in colorectal cancer (CRC), which is evidenced from human CRC specimens, animal models, and cancer cell lines. TMA samples from randomly selected 60 CRC specimens firstly identified the clinical correlation between high SphK2 and increased DPD (p < 0.001). Then the regulatory mechanism was explored in CRC models of villin-SphK2 Tg mice, SphK2(-/-)mice, and human CRC cells xenografted nude mice. Assays of ChIP-Seq and luciferase reporter gene demonstrated that high SphK2 upregulated DPD through promoting the HDAC1-mediated H3K56ac, leading to the degradation of intracellular 5-FU into inactive alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL). Lastly, inhibition of SphK2 by SLR080811 exhibited excellent inhibition on DPD expression and potently reversed 5-FU resistance in colorectal tumors of villin-SphK2 Tg mice. Overall, this study manifests that SphK2(high) conferred 5-FU resistance through upregulating tumoral DPD, which highlights the strategies of blocking SphK2 to overcome 5-FU resistance in CRC.

32555329	Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play pivotal roles in cancer development and progression, and some function in a highly cancer-specific manner. However, whether the cause of their expression is an outcome of a specific regulatory mechanism or nonspecific transcription induced by genome reorganization in cancer remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated a group of lncRNAs that we previously identified to be aberrantly expressed in prostate cancer (PC), called TPCATs. Our high-throughput real-time PCR experiments were integrated with publicly available RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data and revealed that the expression of a subset of TPCATs is driven by PC-specific transcription factors (TFs), especially androgen receptor (AR) and ETS-related gene (ERG). Our in vitro validations confirmed that AR and ERG regulated a subset of TPCATs, most notably for EPCART. Knockout of EPCART was found to reduce migration and proliferation of the PC cells in vitro. The high expression of EPCART and two other TPCATs (TPCAT-3-174133 and TPCAT-18-31849) were also associated with the biochemical recurrence of PC in prostatectomy patients and were independent prognostic markers. Our findings suggest that the expression of numerous PC-associated lncRNAs is driven by PC-specific mechanisms and not by random cellular events that occur during cancer development. Furthermore, we report three prospective prognostic markers for the early detection of advanced PC and show EPCART to be a functionally relevant lncRNA in PC.

32587398	Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a malignant disease and is a common cause of death in China. By performing an integrative study investigating public databases and clinical samples collected by our group, we found that HOXC10 (homeobox C10) is upregulated in ESCC tumor tissues compared with nontumor tissues and that the upregulation of HOXC10 is correlated with the poor prognosis of patients with ESCC. The enforced expression of HOXC10 promoted ESCC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Our study revealed that HOXC10 could bind the promoter region of human Erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (ERBB3/HER3) and activate the PI3K/AKT pathway. In addition, by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis, we found that HOXC10 could bind X-ray repair cross complementing 6 (Ku70) and accelerate the DNA repair mechanism via the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway. We further evaluated HOXC10 expression in ESCC patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy or platinum-based chemotherapy. The results demonstrate that HOXC10 upregulation predicts the poor prognosis of ESCC patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Our study reveals that HOXC10 upregulation reflects the poor prognosis of ESCC patients and directs the selection of postoperative therapy regimens.

32616889	The therapeutic strategies for advanced gastric cancer (GC) remain unsatisfying and limited. Therefore, it is still imperative to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying GC metastasis. Here, we report a novel role of SRY-box transcription factor 18 (SOX18), a member of the SOX family, in promoting GC metastasis. The elevated expression of SOX18 was positively correlated with distant metastasis, higher AJCC stage, and poor prognosis in human GC. SOX18 expression was an independent and significant risk factor for the recurrence and survival in GC patients. Up-regulation of SOX18 promoted GC invasion and metastasis, whereas down-regulation of SOX18 decreased GC invasion and metastasis. Melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM) and C-C motif chemokine ligand 7 (CCL7) are direct transcriptional targets of SOX18. Knockdown of MCAM and CCL7 significantly decreased SOX18-mediated GC invasion and metastasis, while the stable overexpression of MCAM and CCL7 reversed the decrease in cell invasion and metastasis that was induced by the inhibition of SOX18. A mechanistic investigation indicated that the upregulation of SOX18 that was mediated by the CCL7-CCR1 pathway relied on the ERK/ELK1 pathway. SOX18 knockdown significantly reduced CCL7-enhanced GC invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, BX471, a specific CCR1 inhibitor, significantly reduced the SOX18-mediated GC invasion and metastasis. In human GC tissues, SOX18 expression was positively correlated with CCL7 and MCAM expression, and patients with positive coexpression of SOX18/CCL7 or SOX18/MCAM had the worst prognosis. In conclusion, we defined a CCL7-CCR1-SOX18 positive feedback loop that played a pivotal role in GC metastasis, and targeting this pathway may be a promising therapeutic option for the clinical management of GC.

32681068	Localized prostate cancer develops very slowly in most men, with the androgen receptor (AR) and MYC transcription factors amongst the most well-characterized drivers of prostate tumorigenesis. Canonically, MYC up-regulation in luminal prostate cancer cells functions to oppose the terminally differentiating effects of AR. However, the effects of MYC up-regulation are pleiotropic and inconsistent with a poorly proliferative phenotype. Here we show that increased MYC expression and activity are associated with the down-regulation of MEIS1, a HOX-family transcription factor. Using RNA-seq to profile a series of human prostate cancer specimens laser capture microdissected on the basis of MYC immunohistochemistry, MYC activity, and MEIS1 expression were inversely correlated. Knockdown of MYC expression in prostate cancer cells increased the expression of MEIS1 and increased the occupancy of MYC at the MEIS1 locus. Finally, we show in laser capture microdissected human prostate cancer samples and the prostate TCGA cohort that MEIS1 expression is inversely proportional to AR activity as well as HOXB13, a known interacting protein of both AR and MEIS1. Collectively, our data demonstrate that elevated MYC in a subset of primary prostate cancers functions in a negative role in regulating MEIS1 expression, and that this down-regulation may contribute to MYC-driven development and progression.

32661324	Increasing evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play vital roles in the tumorigenesis and progression of cancers. However, the functions and regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) are still largely unknown. Our previous lncRNA expression profiles identified that LINC01503 was overexpressed in NPC. Here, we verified that LINC01503 was highly expressed in NPC and correlated with poor prognosis. LINC01503 promoted NPC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, and facilitated tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC01503 recruited splicing factor proline-and glutamine-rich (SFPQ) to activate Fos like 1 (FOSL1) transcription, and ectopic expression of FOSL1 reversed the suppressive effect of LINC01503 knockdown on NPC progression. Moreover, androgen receptor (AR)-mediated transcription activation was responsible for the overexpression of LINC01503, and AR ligand-dependent cell growth, migration, and invasion in NPC cells. Taken together, our findings reveal that AR-induced LINC01503 can promote NPC progression through the SFPQ-FOSL1 axis, which represents a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for NPC patients.

32661323	Cervical cancer (CC) remains highest in the mortality of female reproductive system cancers, while cisplatin (CDDP) resistance is the one of main reasons for the lethality. Preceding evidence has supported that karyopherins are associated with chemoresistance. In this study, we simultaneously compared CDDP-incomplete responders with CDDP-complete responders of CC patients and CDDP-insensitive CC cell lines with CDDP-sensitive group. We finally identified that DNA-PKcs (PRKDC) was related to CDDP sensitivity after overlapping in CC sample tissues and CC cell lines. Further functional assay revealed that targeting PRKDC by shRNA and NU7026 (specific PRKDC inhibitor) could enhance CDDP sensitivity in vitro and in vivo, which was mediated by impairing DNA damage repair pathway in CC. Mechanistically, we found that PRKDC was transcriptionally upregulated by CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta (CEBPD), while intriguingly, CDDP treatment strengthened the transcriptional activity of CEBPD to PRKDC. We further disclosed that Importin 4 (IPO4) augmented the nuclear translocation of CEBPD through nuclear localization signals (NLS) to activate PRKDC-mediated DNA damage repair in response to CDDP. Moreover, we demonstrated that IPO4 and CEBPD knockdown improved CDDP-induced cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Together, we shed the novel insight into the role of IPO4 in chemosensitivity and provide a clinical translational potential to enhance CC chemosensitivity since the IPO4-CEBPD-PRKDC axis is actionable via NU7026 (PRKDC inhibitor) or targeting IPO4 in combination with CDDP.

32724162	Our previous research demonstrated that extracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) could promote breast cancer cell invasion. However, the impact of extracellular ATP on chemoresistance and the mechanisms behind ATP pro-invasion and pro-chemoresistance remain unclear. Here we aimed to determine the molecules or signaling pathways involved. cDNA microarray was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes before and after ATP treatment. As a result, Sex-determining region Y-box 9 (SOX9) was up-regulated after ATP treatment in breast cancer cells. In vitro invasion and migration assays demonstrated that knocking down SOX9 attenuated ATP-driven invasive capability. Mass spectrometry and co-IP revealed that SOX9 interacted with Janus kinase 1 (JAK1). Afterward, IL-6-JAK1-STAT3 signaling was demonstrated to promote SOX9 expression and invasion following ATP treatment. Notably, ATP-IL-6-SOX9 signaling was shown to stimulate chemoresistance in breast cancer cells. ChIP assays identified some potential SOX9 target genes, among which carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5/6 (CEACAM5/6) was demonstrated to mediate ATP pro-invasive function, while ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) mediated ATP-driven chemoresistance. In addition, SOX9-knockdown and apyrase (an ATP hydrolase)-treated MDA-MB-231 cells illustrated decreased tumor growth and enhanced drug sensitivity in nude mice. In vitro spheroid formation assays also proved the significance of ATP-SOX9 in mediating chemoresistance. Moreover, molecules involved in ATP-SOX9 signaling were up-regulated in human breast carcinoma specimens and were associated with poor prognosis. Altogether, SOX9 signaling is vital in ATP-driven invasion and chemoresistance, which may serve as a potential target for breast cancer therapies.

32712628	Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) building blocks for DNA synthesis, and is a well-recognized target for cancer therapy. RNR is a heterotetramer consisting of two large RRM1 subunits and two small RRM2 subunits. RNR activity is greatly stimulated by transcriptional activation of RRM2 during S/G2 phase to ensure adequate dNTP supply for DNA replication. However, little is known about the cell-cycle-dependent regulation of RNR activity through RRM1. Here, we report that RRM1 is phosphorylated at Ser 559 by CDK2/cyclin A during S/G2 phase. And this S559 phosphorylation of RRM1enhances RNR enzymatic activity and is required for maintaining sufficient dNTPs during normal DNA replication. Defective RRM1 S559 phosphorylation causes DNA replication stress, double-strand break, and genomic instability. Moreover, combined targeting of RRM1 S559 phosphorylation and ATR triggers lethal replication stress and profound antitumor effects. Thus, this posttranslational phosphorylation of RRM1 provides an alternative mechanism to finely regulating RNR and therapeutic opportunities for cancer treatment.

32796959	Identification of pro-metastatic genomic alterations is urgently needed to help understand and prevent the fatal course of prostate cancer. Here, we found that the transcription factor EGR3, located at chromosome 8p21.3, is a critical metastasis suppressor. Aberrant deletion of EGR3 was found in up to 59.76% (deep deletions, 16.87%; shallow deletions, 42.89%) of prostate cancer patients. In informatics analysis, EGR3 loss was associated with prostate cancer progression and low survival rates. EGR3 expression inversely correlated with the expressions of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis-related gene sets in prostate cancer tissues. In prostate cancer cells, EGR3 blocked the EMT process and suppressed cell migration and invasion. In a mouse model for cancer metastasis, EGR3 overexpression significantly suppressed bone metastases of PC3 and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, EGR3 transcriptionally activated ZFP36, GADD45B, and SOCS3 genes by directly binding to their promoter regions. The EMT-inhibitory and tumor-suppressive roles of the EGR3 downstream genes were identified through in vitro and in silico analyses. Together, our results showed that EGR3 may be a biomarker to predict clinical outcomes and that it plays an important role in the metastatic progression of prostate cancer.

32778768	TMPRSS2 is an important membrane-anchored serine protease involved in human prostate cancer progression and metastasis. A serine protease physiologically often comes together with a cognate inhibitor for execution of proteolytically biologic function; however, TMPRSS2's cognate inhibitor is still elusive. To identify the cognate inhibitor of TMPRSS2, in this study, we applied co-immunoprecipitation and LC/MS/MS analysis and isolated hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitors (HAIs) to be potential inhibitor candidates for TMPRSS2. Moreover, the recombinant HAI-2 proteins exhibited a better inhibitory effect on TMPRSS2 proteolytic activity than HAI-1, and recombinant HAI-2 proteins had a high affinity to form a complex with TMPRSS2. The immunofluorescence images further showed that TMPRSS2 was co-localized to HAI-2. Both KD1 and KD2 domain of HAI-2 showed comparable inhibitory effects on TMPRSS2 proteolytic activity. In addition, HAI-2 overexpression could suppress the induction effect of TMPRSS2 on pro-HGF activation, extracellular matrix degradation and prostate cancer cell invasion. We further determined that the expression levels of TMPRSS2 were inversely correlated with HAI-2 levels during prostate cancer progression. In orthotopic xenograft animal model, TMPRSS2 overexpression promoted prostate cancer metastasis, and HAI-2 overexpression efficiently blocked TMPRSS2-induced metastasis. In summary, the results together indicate that HAI-2 can function as a cognate inhibitor for TMPRSS2 in human prostate cancer cells and may serve as a potential factor to suppress TMPRSS2-mediated malignancy.

32770142	Avoiding immune destruction is essential for tumorigenesis. Current research into the interaction between tumor and immunological niches complement tumor pathology beyond cancer genetics. Intrinsic host defense immunity is a specialized innate immunity component to restrict viral infection. However, whether intrinsic immunity participates in tumor pathology is unclear. Previously, we identified a zinc-finger antiviral protein ZAP that is commonly downregulated in a panel of clinical cancer specimens. However, whether ZAP has an impact on tumor development was unknown. Here we report ZAP as a genuine tumor suppressor. Pan-caner analysis with TCGA data from 712 patients and large-scale immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays from 1552 patients reveal that ZAP is prevalently downregulated, and associated with poor survival in liver, colon, and bladder cancer patients. Ectopic over-expression of ZAP inhibits the malignant phenotypes of colorectal tumor by cell cycle arrest. Using RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA decay assays, we demonstrate that ZAP directly and specifically binds to and degrades the transcript of TRAILR4, which in turn represses TRAILR4 expression and inhibits the aggressiveness of colorectal cancer cells. Furthermore, our CRISPR-engineered mice models show that loss-of-function of ZAP synergizes with APC-deficiency to drive malignant colorectal cancer in vivo. Overall, we identify a previously unknown function of the antiviral factor ZAP in colorectal tumorigenesis, linking intrinsic immunity to tumor pathogenetics.

32814829	VHL mutations are the most common tumorigenic lesions in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and result in continued activation of the HIF/VEGF pathway and uncontrolled cancer progression. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors such as sunitinib have been demonstrated to target tumorigenic signaling pathways, delay tumor progression, and improve patient prognosis in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Although several mechanisms of sunitinib resistance have been reported, the solutions to overcome this resistance remain unclear. In our study, we found that increased expression of Y-box binding protein 1 (YB1, a multidrug resistance associated protein) and EphA2 (a member of the erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular (Eph) receptor family, belonging to the RTK family) mediated sunitinib resistance and mRCC exhibited a large phenotypic dependence on YB1 and EphA2. In addition, our findings confirm that YB1 promotes the invasion, metastasis and sunitinib resistance of ccRCC by regulating the EphA2 signaling pathway. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of EphA2 through the small molecule inhibitor ALW-II-41-27 reduced the proliferation of sunitinib-resistant tumor cells, suppressed tumor growth in vivo, and restored the sensitivity of sunitinib-resistant tumor cells to sunitinib in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, YB1 increases the protein levels of EphA2 by maintaining the protein stability of EphA2 through inhibition of the proteasomal degradation pathway. Collectively, our findings provide the theoretical rationale that ccRCC metastasis and RTK-directed therapeutic resistance could be prospectively and purposefully targeted.

32811980	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. Exploring the mechanism of HCC and identifying ideal targets is critical. In the present study, we demonstrated metabolism dysfunction might be a key diver for the development of HCC. The mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component 2 (MARC2) as a newly discovered molybdenum enzyme was downregulated in human HCC tissues and HCC cells. Downregulated MARC2 was significantly associated with clinicopathological characteristics of HCC, such as tumor size, AFP levels, and tumor grade and was an independent risk factor of poor prognosis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies suggested that MARC2 suppressed the progression of HCC by regulating the protein expression level of p27. The Hippo signaling pathway and RNF123 were required for this process. Moreover, MARC2 regulated expression of HNF4A via the Hippo signaling pathway. HNF4A was recruited to the promoter of MARC2 forming a feedback loop. MARC2 levels were downregulated by methylation. We demonstrated the prognostic value of MARC2 in HCC and determined the mechanism by which MARC2 suppressed the progression of HCC in this study. These findings may lead to new therapeutic targets for HCC.	A novel mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component 2 is a favorable indicator of cancer and suppresses the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma by regulating the expression of p27.	Oncogene	0
32796958	The long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) abnormally expresses in several cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To better understand the role of key lncRNA involving cancer progress, we conduct a comprehensive data mining on LINC00467 and determine its molecular mechanisms. We identified LINC00467 was the up-regulated lncRNA that common significantly differentially expressed in NSCLC and CRC tissues from GEO database. LINC00467 highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and associated with advanced clinical stages and poor outcome. Knockdown of LINC00467 inhibited cell growth and metastasis via regulating the Akt signaling pathway. Finally, we demonstrated that TDG mediated acetylation is the key factor controlling LINC00467 expression. In conclusion, LINC00467 promotes NSCLC progression via Akt signal pathway. The identified LINC00467 may serve as a valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarker as well as a therapeutic target for NSCLC.

32826951	Hypoxic tumor microenvironment(TME) is a universal feature in solid carcinoma and is associated with unfavorable prognosis. Tumor-derived exosomes are now significantly implicating in mediating cellular communication and interactions in TME. The aim of this study was to identify exosomal miR-301a-3p involved in gastric cancer(GC) progression and metastasis. Here, we found hypoxia promote GC exosomes release and miR-301a-3p expression in an HIF-1alpha-dependent manner. In hypoxic TME, enriched miR-301a-3p could be transmitted between GC cells via exosomes and then contributed to inhibit HIF-1alpha degradation through targeting PHD3, that were capable to hydroxylate HIF-1alpha subunits to ubiquitinate degradation. This synergistical positive feedback loop between HIF-1alpha and miR-301a-3p facilitated GC proliferation, invasion, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In clinical samples, we further discovered circulating exosomal miR-301a-3p in serum was positively related with peritoneal metastasis. Collectively, these data indicate that GC cells could generate miR-301a-3p-rich exosomes in the hypoxic TME, which then help to HIF-1alpha accumulation and promote GC malignant behaviors and metastasis. Exosomal miR-301a-3p/HIF-1alpha signaling axis may serve as a promising predictor and potential therapeutic target of GC with metastasis.

32848212	For many tumor types chemotherapy still represents the therapy of choice and many standard treatments are based on the use of platinum (PT) drugs. However, de novo or acquired resistance to platinum is frequent and leads to disease progression. In Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) patients, PT-resistant recurrences are very common and improving the response to treatment still represents an unmet clinical need. To identify new modulators of PT-sensitivity, we performed a loss-of-function screening targeting 680 genes potentially involved in the response of EOC cells to platinum. We found that SGK2 (Serum-and Glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 2) plays a key role in PT-response. We show here that EOC cells relay on the induction of autophagy to escape PT-induced death and that SGK2 inhibition increases PT sensitivity inducing a block in the autophagy cascade due to the impairment of lysosomal acidification. Mechanistically we demonstrate that SGK2 controls autophagy in a kinase-dependent manner by binding and inhibiting the V-ATPase proton pump. Accordingly, SGK2 phosphorylates the subunit V1H (ATP6V1H) of V-ATPase and silencing or chemical inhibition of SGK2, affects the normal autophagic flux and sensitizes EOC cells to platinum. Hence, we identified a new pathway that links autophagy to the survival of cancer cells under platinum treatment in which the druggable kinase SGK2 plays a central role. Our data suggest that blocking autophagy via SGK2 inhibition could represent a novel therapeutic strategy to improve patients' response to platinum.	Serum- and glucocorticoid- inducible kinase 2, SGK2, is a novel autophagy regulator and modulates platinum drugs response in cancer cells.	Oncogene	0
32848211	Cancer can metastasize from early lesions without detectable tumors. Despite extensive studies on metastasis in cancer cells from patients with detectable primary tumors, mechanisms for early metastatic dissemination are poorly understood. Her2 promotes breast cancer early dissemination by inhibiting p38, but the downstream pathway in this process was unknown. Using early lesion breast cancer models, we demonstrate that the effect of p38 suppression by Her2 on early dissemination is mediated by MK2 and heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27). The early disseminating cells in the MMTV-Her2 breast cancer model are Her2(high)p-p38(low)p-MK2(low)p-Hsp27(low), which also exist in human breast carcinoma tissues. Suppression of p38 and MK2 by Her2 reduces MK2-mediated Hsp27 phosphorylation, and unphosphorylated Hsp27 binds to beta-catenin and enhances its phosphorylation by Src, leading to beta-catenin activation and disseminating phenotypes in early lesion breast cancer cells. Pharmacological inhibition of MK2 promotes, while inhibition of a p38 phosphatase Wip1 suppresses, early dissemination in vivo. These findings identify Her2-mediated suppression of the p38-MK2-Hsp27 pathway as a novel mechanism for cancer early dissemination, and provide a basis for new therapies targeting early metastatic dissemination in Her2(+) breast cancer.

32884116	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a therapeutically challenging disease with poor survival rates, owing to late diagnosis and early dissemination. These tumors frequently undergo perineural invasion, spreading along nerves regionally and to distant sites. The RET receptor tyrosine kinase is implicated in increased aggressiveness, local invasion, and metastasis in multiple cancers, including PDAC. RET mediates directional motility and invasion towards sources of its neurotrophic factor ligands, suggesting that it may enhance perineural invasion of tumor cells towards nerves. RET is expressed as two main isoforms, RET9 and RET51, which differ in their protein interactions and oncogenic potentials, however, the contributions of RET isoforms to neural invasion have not been investigated. In this study, we generated total RET and isoform-specific knockdown PDAC cell lines and assessed the contributions of RET isoforms to PDAC invasive spread. Our data show that RET activity induces cell polarization and actin remodeling through activation of CDC42 and RHOA GTPases to promote directional motility in PDAC cells. Further, we show that RET interacts with the adaptor protein TKS5 to induce invadopodia formation, enhance matrix degradation and promote tumor cell invasion through a SRC and GRB2-dependent mechanism. Finally, we show that RET51 is the predominant isoform contributing to these RET-mediated invasive processes in PDAC. Together, our work suggests that RET expression in pancreatic cancers may enhance tumor aggressiveness by promoting perineural invasion, and that RET expression may be a valuable marker of invasiveness, and a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of these cancers.

32879443	Posttranslational modifications of histone and nonhistone proteins greatly influence numerous molecular events in multiple diseases. Jumonji domain-containing proteins are a family functioning as histone demethylase. Jumonji domain-containing protein 8 (JMJD8) is Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-only member of this family, and its physiological functions remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which aberrant JMJD8 stimulates phosphorylation of AKT and activate AKT/GSK3beta/beta-catenin signaling pathway thereby promotes tumor cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We demonstrated that knockdown of JMJD8 increased the interaction of SETDB1 and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) with AKT1 and resulted in enhanced trimethylation of AKT1 at lysine 142 (K142), which is crucial for cell membrane recruitment, phosphorylation, and activation of AKT. Moreover, the mutation of histidine 200 of JMJD8 (JMJD8-H200Q) disrupted its binding with AKT1 and increased interaction of SETDB1 and PDK1 with AKT1. Furthermore, histone demethylase jumonji domain-containing protein 2B functioned as an adapter to recruit beta-catenin to the methylated AKT1 upon JMJD8 depression, which facilitated the phosphorylation of beta-catenin at Ser552 and its accumulation in cell nucleus where the activated beta-catenin transcriptionally stimulated the expression of genes involved in EMT. In conclusion, our data unraveled a novel role of JMJD8 in regulating the migration and invasion of tumor via modulating AKT methylation and activation. In addition, this study showed that JMJD8 is a potential biomarker and drug design target for tumor EMT.

32929153	Evidence suggests that tripartite motif-containing 2 (TRIM2) is associated with carcinogenic effects in several malignancies. However, the expression patterns and roles of TRIM2 in pancreatic cancer are rarely studied. Our study demonstrated that TRIM2 was expressed in a high percentage of pancreatic tumors. High TRIM2 expression was negatively correlated with the outcome of pancreatic cancer. TRIM2 silencing significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion, and in vivo tumorigenicity of pancreatic cancer cells. Regarding the mechanism involved, TRIM2 activated ROS-related E2-related factor 2 (NRF2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling and the integrin/focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathway. Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine decreased ROS activity and expression level of NRF2 and ITGB7. Increased translocation of NRF2 protein into nucleus further rescued the inhibited ITGB7 transcription. Moreover, NRF2 bound to the potential ARE on the promoter region and enhanced the transcriptional activity of ITGB7, indicating the bridging effect of NRF2 between the two signaling pathways. In summary, our study provides evidence that upregulated TRIM2 in pancreatic cancer predicts short survival for pancreatic cancer patients. TRIM2 accelerates pancreatic cancer progression via the ROS-related NRF2/ITGB7/FAK axis.	Oncogenic function of TRIM2 in pancreatic cancer by activating ROS-related NRF2/ITGB7/FAK axis.	Oncogene	0
32929152	A major clinical challenge of ovarian cancer is the development of malignant ascites accompanied by widespread peritoneal metastasis. In ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC), a challenging subtype of ovarian cancer, this problem is compounded by near-universal primary chemoresistance; patients with advanced stage OCCC thus lack effective therapies and face extremely poor survival rates. Here we show that tumor-cell-expressed serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1) is a key driver of OCCC progression and metastasis. Using cell culture models of human OCCC, we find that shRNA silencing of SPINK1 sensitizes tumor cells to anoikis and inhibits proliferation. Knockdown of SPINK1 in OCCC cells also profoundly suppresses peritoneal metastasis in mouse implantation models of human OCCC. We next identify a novel autocrine signaling axis in OCCC cells whereby tumor-cell-produced interleukin-6 (IL-6) regulates SPINK1 expression to stimulate a common protumorigenic gene expression pattern leading to anoikis resistance and proliferation of OCCC cells. We further demonstrate that this signaling pathway can be successfully interrupted with the IL-6Ralpha inhibitor tocilizumab, sensitizing cells to anoikis in vitro and reducing metastasis in vivo. These results suggest that clinical trials of IL-6 pathway inhibitors in OCCC may be warranted, and that SPINK1 might offer a candidate predictive biomarker in this population.

32917954	Notwithstanding intensified therapy, a considerable fraction of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients face a dismal prognosis due to primary resistance to treatment and relapse, raising the need for more efficient and targeted therapies. Hedgehog (HH) signaling is a major developmental pathway frequently deregulated in cancer, for which a role in T-ALL is emerging. Mounting evidence suggests that ligand-independent activation of HH pathway occurs in cancer including T-ALL, emphasizing the necessity of dissecting the complex interplay between HH and other signaling pathways regulating activation. In this work, we present a therapeutically relevant crosstalk between HH signaling and the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) pathway acting at the level of GLI1 transcription factor. GLI inhibitor GANT61 and dexamethasone were shown to exert a synergistic anti-leukemic effect in vitro in T-ALL cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. Mechanistically, dexamethasone-activated NR3C1 impaired GLI1 function by dynamically modulating the recruitment of PCAF acetyltransferase and HDAC1 deacetylase. Increased GLI1 acetylation was associated with compromised transcriptional activity and reduced protein stability. In summary, our study identifies a novel crosstalk between GLI1 and NR3C1 signaling pathway which could be exploited in HH-dependent malignancies to increase therapeutic efficacy.

32958832	Autophagy can protect stressed cancer cell by degradation of damaged proteins and organelles. However, the regulatory mechanisms behind this cellular process remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that RSK2 (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2) plays a critical role in ER stress-induced autophagy in breast cancer cells. We demonstrated that the promotive effect of RSK2 on autophagy resulted from directly binding of AMPKalpha2 in nucleus and phosphorylating it at Thr172 residue. IRE1alpha, an ER membrane-associated protein mediating unfolded protein response (UPR), is required for transducing the signal for activation of ERK1/2-RSK2 under ER stress. Suppression of autophagy by knockdown of RSK2 enhanced the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to ER stress both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that inhibition of RSK2-mediated autophagy rendered breast cancer cells more sensitive to paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent that induces ER stress-mediated cell death. This study identifies RSK2 as a novel controller of autophagy in tumor cells and suggests that targeting RSK2 can be exploited as an approach to reinforce the efficacy of ER stress-inducing agents against cancer.

32943729	Recent studies indicated that the androgen receptor (AR) plays important roles in modulating metastasis of VHL-mutant clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). However, the precise mechanisms of AR roles in VHL wild-type (VHL-wt) ccRCC, remain unclear. Here we found that AR interacted with VHL to modulate the metastasis of VHL-wt ccRCC via an oxygen-dependent manner. Mechanism dissection revealed that AR could transcriptionally suppress the miR-185-5p expression in the presence of functional VHL-wt protein under a normoxic condition, which might then result in increasing the expression of VEGF-A and VEGF-C via targeting the 3'UTR of mRNAs at a post-transcriptional level. In contrast, under a hypoxic condition, AR could increase miR-185-5p expression to suppress VEGF-C expression, yet this miR-185-5p effect on VEGF-A was reversed via AR's positive regulation on the HIF2alpha-increased VEGF-A expression that resulted in increasing VEGF-A in the VHL-wt RCC cells. These distinct AR functions under different oxygen conditions may involve the VHL-impacted ubiquitination and nuclear localization of AR. The differential regulation of VEGF-A vs VEGF-C by AR may then result in differential impacts on the ccRCC metastatic destinations of VHL-wt ccRCC cells under different oxygen conditions. These finer mechanisms may help in the development of a novel therapy to better suppress the ccRCC progression under different oxygenization conditions.

32934314	Fibroblast growth factor receptor type 2 (FGFR2) has emerged as a key oncogenic factor that regulates gastric cancer (GC) progression, but the underlying mechanism of FGF-FGFR2 signaling pathway remains largely unknown. To identify the potential molecular mechanisms of the oncogenic FGFR2 in gastric carcinogenesis and convey a novel therapeutic strategy, we profiled the FGFR alterations and analyzed their clinical associations in TCGA and Hong Kong GC cohorts. We found that FGFR2 overexpression in GC cell lines and primary tumors predicted poor survival and was associated with advanced stages of GC. Functionally, growth abilities and cell cycle progression of GC were inhibited by inactivation of ERK-MAPK signal transduction after FGFR2 knockdown, while apoptosis was promoted. Meanwhile, the first-line anti-cancer drug sensitivity was enhanced. RNA-seq analysis further revealed that YAP1 signaling serves as a significant downstream modulator and mediates the oncogenic signaling of FGFR2. When stimulating FGFR2 by rhFGF18, we observed intensified F-actin, nuclear accumulation of YAP1, and overexpression of YAP1 targets, but these effects were attenuated by either FGFR2 depletion or AZD4547 administration. Additionally, the FGF18-FGFR2 signaling upregulated YAP1 expression through activating c-Jun, an effector of MAPK signaling. In our cohort, 28.94% of GC cases were characterized as FGFR2, c-Jun, and YAP1 co-positive and demonstrated worse clinical outcomes. Remarkably, we also found that co-targeting FGFR2 and YAP1 by AZD4547 and Verteporfin synergistically enhanced the antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, we have identified the oncogenic FGF-FGFR2 regulates YAP1 signaling in GC. The findings also highlight the translational potential of FGFR2-c-Jun-YAP1 axis, which may serve as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for GC.	FGF18-FGFR2 signaling triggers the activation of c-Jun-YAP1 axis to promote carcinogenesis in a subgroup of gastric cancer patients and indicates translational potential.	Oncogene	0
32978522	Progression through mitosis is balanced by the timely regulation of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events ensuring the correct segregation of chromosomes before cytokinesis. This balance is regulated by the opposing actions of CDK1 and PP2A, as well as the Greatwall kinase/MASTL. MASTL is commonly overexpressed in cancer, which makes it a potential therapeutic anticancer target. Loss of Mastl induces multiple chromosomal errors that lead to the accumulation of micronuclei and multilobulated cells in mitosis. Our analyses revealed that loss of Mastl leads to chromosome breaks and abnormalities impairing correct segregation. Phospho-proteomic data for Mastl knockout cells revealed alterations in proteins implicated in multiple processes during mitosis including double-strand DNA damage repair. In silico prediction of the kinases with affected activity unveiled NEK2 to be regulated in the absence of Mastl. We uncovered that, RAD51AP1, involved in regulation of homologous recombination, is phosphorylated by NEK2 and CDK1 but also efficiently dephosphorylated by PP2A/B55. Our results suggest that MastlKO disturbs the equilibrium of the mitotic phosphoproteome that leads to the disruption of DNA damage repair and triggers an accumulation of chromosome breaks even in noncancerous cells.

32978520	The transcription factor NRF2 is the major mediator of oxidative stress responses and is closely connected to therapy resistance in tumors harboring activating mutations in the NRF2 pathway. In melanoma, such mutations are rare, and it is unclear to what extent melanomas rely on NRF2. Here we show that NRF2 suppresses the activity of the melanocyte lineage marker MITF in melanoma, thereby reducing the expression of pigmentation markers. Intriguingly, we furthermore identified NRF2 as key regulator of immune-modulating genes, linking oxidative stress with the induction of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) in an ATF4-dependent manner. COX2 is critical for the secretion of prostaglandin E2 and was strongly induced by H2O2 or TNFalpha only in presence of NRF2. Induction of MITF and depletion of COX2 and PGE2 were also observed in NRF2-deleted melanoma cells in vivo. Furthermore, genes corresponding to the innate immune response such as RSAD2 and IFIH1 were strongly elevated in absence of NRF2 and coincided with immune evasion parameters in human melanoma datasets. Even in vitro, NRF2 activation or prostaglandin E2 supplementation blunted the induction of the innate immune response in melanoma cells. Transcriptome analyses from lung adenocarcinomas indicate that the observed link between NRF2 and the innate immune response is not restricted to melanoma.

32973331	Wnt signaling dysregulation promotes tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC). We investigated the role of PTPRF, a receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase, in regulating Wnt signaling in CRC. Knockdown of PTPRF decreased cell proliferation in patient-derived primary colon cancer cells and established CRC cell lines. In addition, the rate of proliferation as well as colony formation ability were significantly decreased in tumor organoids grown in 3D, whereas the number of differentiated tumor organoids were markedly increased. Consistently, knockdown of PTPRF resulted in a decrease in the expression of genes associated with cancer stem cells downstream of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Treating PTPRF knockdown cells with GSK3 inhibitor rescued the expression of Wnt target genes suggesting that PTPRF functions upstream of the beta-catenin destruction complex. PTPRF was found to interact with LRP6 and silencing PTPRF largely decreased the activation of LRP6. Interestingly, this PTPRF-mediated activation of Wnt signaling was blocked in cells treated with clathrin endocytosis inhibitor. Furthermore, knockdown of PTPRF inhibited xenograft tumor growth in vivo and decreased the expression of Wnt target genes. Taken together, our studies identify a novel role of PTPRF as an oncogenic protein phosphatase in supporting the activation of Wnt signaling in CRC.

32978516	RNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification. Recent studies on RNA methylation mainly focus on the m(6)A modification of mRNA, but very little is known about the m(5)C modification. NSUN2 is an RNA methyltransferase responsible for the m(5)C modification of multiple RNAs. In this study, we knocked down the NSUN2 gene in HepG2 cells by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and performed high-throughput RNA-BisSeq. An important tumor-related lncRNA H19 was identified to be targeted by NSUN2. Studies have shown that the expression of H19 lncRNA is abnormally elevated and has a carcinogenic effect in many types of tumors. Our results demonstrated that m(5)C modification of H19 lncRNA can increase its stability. Interestingly, m(5)C-modified H19 lncRNA can be specifically bound by G3BP1, a well-known oncoprotein which further leads to MYC accumulation. This may be a novel mechanism by which lncRNA H19 exerts its oncogenic effect. Besides, both the m(5)C methylation level and the expression level of H19 lncRNA in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues were significantly higher than those in adjacent non-cancer tissues, which were closely associated with poor differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In conclusion, we found that H19 RNA is a specific target for the NSUN2 modifier. The m(5)C-modified H19 lncRNA may promote the occurrence and development of tumors by recruiting the G3BP1 oncoprotein. Our findings may provide a potential target and biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of HCC.

33067576	Based on Stephen Paget's well-established theory, both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms are crucial for metastasis. Although the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) has been suggested to be involved in breast cancer (BC) progression via cell-autonomous mechanisms, whether it assists the metastasis of BC cells through non-cell-autonomous mechanisms remains unclear. This study aimed to demonstrate that the MCU regulates BC metastatic colonization via non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. The results suggested that extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from MCU-downregulated MDA-MB-231 cells suppressed angiogenesis in the metastatic niche in a nude mouse model, thereby hindering the colonization of BC cells. Mechanistically, we revealed that the MCU negatively correlated with miR-4488 in EVs derived from BC cells. Significantly, miR-4488 was determined to suppress angiogenesis of vascular endothelial cells by directly targeting angiogenic CX3CL1. Furthermore, we identified miR-4488 as being significantly downregulated in serum EVs from patients with triple-negative BC. Hence, this study suggests that MCU-dependent negative sorting of miR-4488 to EVs enhances angiogenesis in the metastatic niche and, thus, favors the metastatic colonization of BC cells.

32989256	Multiple RNA processing events including transcription, mRNA splicing, and export are delicately coordinated by the TREX complex. As one of the essential subunits, DDX39B couples the splicing and export machineries by recruiting ALYREF onto mRNA. In this study, we further explore the functions of DDX39B in handling damaged DNA, and unexpectedly find that DDX39B facilitates DNA repair by homologous recombination through upregulating BRCA1. Specifically, DDX39B binds to and stabilizes BRCA1 mRNA. DDX39B ensures ssDNA formation and RAD51 accumulation at DSB sites by maintaining BRCA1 levels. Without DDX39B being present, ovarian cancer cells exhibit hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents like platinum or PARPi. Moreover, DDX39B-deficient mice show embryonic lethality or developmental retardation, highly reminiscent of those lacking BRCA1. High DDX39B expression is correlated with worse survival in ovarian cancer patients. Thus, DDX39B suppression represents a rational approach for enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy in BRCA1-proficient ovarian cancers.

33009487	"The mechanism underlying EZH2 overexpression in breast cancer and its involvement in tumorigenesis remain poorly understood. In this study, we developed an approach to systematically identify the trans-acting factors regulating the EZH2 expression, and identified more than 20 such factors. We revealed reciprocal regulation of early growth response 1 (EGR1) and EZH2: EGR1 activates the expression of EZH2, and EZH2 represses EGR1 expression. Using CRISPR-mediated genome/epigenome editing, we demonstrated that EHZ2 represses EGR1 expression through a silencer downstream of the EGR1 gene. Deletion of the EGR1 silencer resulted in reduced cell growth, invasion, tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells, and extensive changes in gene expression, such as upregulation of GADD45, DDIT3, and RND1; and downregulation of genes encoding cholesterol biosynthesis pathway enzymes. We hypothesize that EZH2/PRC2 acts as a ""brake"" for EGR1 expression by targeting the EGR1 silencer, and EZH2 overexpression dampens tumor-suppressive signals mediated by EGR1 to drive breast tumorigenesis."

33082558	Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant tumor suppressor syndrome, characterized by tumor development in multiple organs, including renal angiomyolipoma. Biallelic loss of TSC1 or TSC2 is a known genetic driver of angiomyolipoma development, however, whether an altered transcriptional repertoire contributes to TSC-associated tumorigenesis is unknown. RNA-seq analyses showed that MITF A isoform (MITF-A) was consistently highly expressed in angiomyolipoma, immunohistochemistry showed microphthalmia-associated transcription factor nuclear localization, and Chromatin immuno-Precipitation Sequencing analysis showed that the MITF-A transcriptional start site was highly enriched with H3K27ac marks. Using the angiomyolipoma cell line 621-101, MITF knockout (MITF.KO) and MITF-A overexpressing (MITF.OE) cell lines were generated. MITF.KO cells showed markedly reduced growth and invasion in vitro, and were unable to form xenografted tumors. In contrast, MITF.OE cells grew faster in vitro and as xenografted tumors compared to control cells. RNA-Seq analysis showed that both ID2 and Cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61) expression levels were increased in the MITF.OE cells and reduced in the MITF.KO cells, and luciferase assays showed this was due to transcriptional effects. Importantly, CYR61 overexpression rescued MITF.KO cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. These findings suggest that MITF-A is a transcriptional oncogenic driver of angiomyolipoma tumor development, acting through regulation of CYR61.

33051595	Hepatitis B x protein (HBx) affects cellular protein expression and participates in the tumorigenesis and progression of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Metabolic reprogramming contributed to the HCC development, but its role in HBV-related HCC remains largely unclear. Tyrosine-protein phosphatase nonreceptor type 13 (PTPN13) is a significant regulator in tumor development, however, its specific role in hepatocarcinogenesis remains to be explored. Here, we found that decreased PTPN13 expression was associated with HBV/HBx. Patients with low PTPN13 expression showed a poor prognosis. Functional assays revealed that PTPN13 inhibited proliferation and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Further mechanistic studies indicated that HBx inhibited PTPN13 expression by upregulating the expression of DNMT3A and interacting with DNMT3A. Furthermore, we found that DNMT3A bound to the PTPN13 promoter (-343 to -313 bp) in an epigenetically controlled manner associated with elevated DNA methylation and then inhibited PTPN13 transcription. In addition, we identified IGF2BP1 as a novel PTPN13-interacting gene and demonstrated that PTPN13 influences c-Myc expression by directly and competitively binding to IGF2BP1 to decrease the intracellular concentration of functional IGF2BP1. Overexpressing PTPN13 promoted c-Myc mRNA degradation independent of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity of PTPN13. Importantly, we discovered that the PTPN13-IGF2BP1-c-Myc axis was important for cancer cell growth through promoting metabolic reprogramming. We verified the significant negative correlations between PTPN13 expression and c-Myc, PSPH, and SLC7A1 expression in clinical HCC tissue samples. In summary, our findings demonstrate that PTPN13 is a novel regulator of HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis and may play an important role in HCC. PTPN13 may serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in HBV-related HCC patients.

33149280	Paxillin (PXN), a key component of the focal adhesion complex, has been associated with cancer progression, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to elucidate mechanisms by which PXN affects cancer growth and progression, which we addressed using cancer patient data, cell lines, and orthotopic mouse models. We demonstrated a previously unrecognized mechanism whereby nuclear PXN enhances angiogenesis by transcriptionally regulating SRC expression. SRC, in turn, increases PLAT expression through NF-kB activation; PLAT promotes angiogenesis via LRP1 in endothelial cells. PXN silencing in ovarian cancer mouse models reduced angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis. These findings provide a new understanding of the role of PXN in regulating tumor angiogenesis and growth.	The hidden role of paxillin: localization to nucleus promotes tumor angiogenesis.	Oncogene	0
33191406	Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which is a heterodimeric tetramer composed of RRM1 and RRM2 subunits, is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) and essential for both DNA replication and the repair of DNA damage. The activity of RNR is coordinated with the cell cycle and regulated by fluctuations in the level of the RRM2 subunit. Multiple cancer types, including Ewing sarcoma tumors, are sensitive to inhibitors of RNR or a reduction in the levels of either the RRM1 or RRM2 subunits of RNR. Here, we show that the expression of the RRM2 protein is dependent on active protein synthesis and that 4E-BP1, a repressor of cap-dependent protein translation, specifically regulates the level of the RRM2 protein. Furthermore, inhibition of mTORC1/2, but not mTORC1, activates 4E-BP1, inhibits protein synthesis, and reduces the level of the RRM2 protein in multiple sarcoma cell lines. This effect of mTORC1/2 inhibitors on protein synthesis and RRM2 levels was rescued in cell lines with the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of 4E-BP1. In addition, the inducible expression of a mutant 4E-BP1 protein that cannot be phosphorylated by mTOR blocked protein synthesis and inhibited the growth of Ewing sarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo in a xenograft. Overall, these results provide insight into the multifaceted regulation of RRM2 protein levels and identify a regulatory link between protein translation and DNA replication.

33188295	Cadherins form a large and pleiotropic superfamily of membranous proteins sharing Ca(2+)-binding repeats. While the importance of classic cadherins such as E- or N-cadherin for tumorigenesis is acknowledged, there is much less information about other cadherins that are merely considered as tissue-specific adhesion molecules. Here, we focused on the atypical cadherin MUCDHL that stood out for its unusual features and unique function in the gut. Analyses of transcriptomic data sets (n > 250) established that MUCDHL mRNA levels are down-regulated in colorectal tumors. Importantly, the decrease of MUCDHL expression is more pronounced in the worst-prognosis subset of tumors and is associated with decreased survival. Molecular characterization of the tumors indicated a negative correlation with proliferation-related processes (e.g., nucleic acid metabolism, DNA replication). Functional genomic studies showed that the loss of MUCDHL enhanced tumor incidence and burden in intestinal tumor-prone mice. Extensive structure/function analyses revealed that the mode of action of MUCDHL goes beyond membrane sequestration of ss-catenin and targets through its extracellular domain key oncogenic signaling pathways (e.g., EGFR, AKT). Beyond MUCDHL, this study illustrates how the loss of a gene critical for the morphological and functional features of mature cells contributes to tumorigenesis by dysregulating oncogenic pathways.	The atypical cadherin MUCDHL antagonizes colon cancer formation and inhibits oncogenic signaling through multiple mechanisms.	Oncogene	1
33293694	The tumor suppressor SMAD4 is frequently mutated in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, no effective targeted therapies exist for CRC with SMAD4 loss. Here, we employed a synthetic lethality drug screening in isogenic SMAD4(+/+) and SMAD4(-/-) HCT116 CRC cells and found that bromodomain and extra-terminal motif (BET) inhibitors, as selective drugs for the growth of SMAD4(-/-) HCT116 cells. BET inhibition selectively induced G1 cell cycle arrest in SMAD4(-/-) cells and this effect was accompanied by the reprogramming of the MYC-p21 axis. Mechanistically, SMAD4 is a transcription repressor of MYC, and MYC in turn represses p21 transcription. SMAD4(-/-) cells lost MYC repression ability, thereby causing the cells addicted to the MYC oncogenic signaling. BET inhibition significantly reduced MYC level and restored p21 expression in SMAD4(-/-) cells, inducing the selective growth arrest. The ectopic overexpression of MYC or the silencing of p21 could rescue the BET inhibitor-induced growth arrest in SMAD4(-/-) cells, verifying this model. Tumor xenograft mouse experiments further demonstrated the synthetic lethality interaction between BET and SMAD4 in vivo. Taken together, our data suggest that BET could be a potential drug target for the treatment of SMAD4-deficient CRC.	Bromodomain and extra-terminal motif (BET) inhibition is synthetic lethal with loss of SMAD4 in colorectal cancer cells via restoring the loss of MYC repression.	Oncogene	0
33323974	Metastatic melanoma is hallmarked by its ability of phenotype switching to more slowly proliferating, but highly invasive cells. Here, we tested the impact of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) on melanoma progression in association with melanocyte inducing transcription factor (MITF) expression levels. We established a mouse melanoma model for deleting Stat3 in melanocytes with specific expression of human hyperactive NRAS(Q61K) in an Ink4a-deficient background, two frequent driver mutations in human melanoma. Mice devoid of Stat3 showed early disease onset with higher proliferation in primary tumors, but displayed significantly diminished lung, brain, and liver metastases. Whole-genome expression profiling of tumor-derived cells also showed a reduced invasion phenotype, which was further corroborated by 3D melanoma model analysis. Notably, loss or knockdown of STAT3 in mouse or human cells resulted in the upregulation of MITF and induction of cell proliferation. Mechanistically we show that STAT3-induced CAAT Box Enhancer Binding Protein (CEBP) expression was sufficient to suppress MITF transcription. Epigenetic analysis by ATAC-seq confirmed that CEBPa/b binding to the MITF enhancer region silenced the MITF locus. Finally, by classification of patient-derived melanoma samples, we show that STAT3 and MITF act antagonistically and hence contribute differentially to melanoma progression. We conclude that STAT3 is a driver of the metastatic process in melanoma and able to antagonize MITF via direct induction of CEBP family member transcription.	STAT3 promotes melanoma metastasis by CEBP-induced repression of the MITF pathway.	Oncogene	1
33323967	Dysregulated androgen receptor (AR) plays a crucial role in prostate cancer (PCa) development, though further factors involved in its regulation remain to be identified. Recently, paradoxical results were reported on the implication of the MEN1 gene in PCa. To dissect its role in prostate luminal cells, we generated a mouse model with inducible Men1 disruption in Nkx3.1-deficient mice in which mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN) occur. Prostate glands from mutant and control mice were analyzed pathologically and molecularly; cellular and molecular analyses were carried out in PCa cell lines after MEN1 knockdown (KD) by siRNA. Double-mutant mice developed accelerated mPIN and later displayed microinvasive adenocarcinoma. Markedly, early-stage lesions exhibited a decreased expression of AR and its target genes, accompanied by reduced CK18 and E-cadherin expression, suggesting a shift from a luminal to a dedifferentiated epithelial phenotype. Intriguingly, over 60% of menin-deficient cells expressed CD44 at a later stage. Furthermore, MEN1 KD led to the increase in CD44 expression in PC3 cells re-expressing AR. Menin bound to the proximal AR promoter and regulated AR transcription via the H3K4me3 histone mark. Interestingly, the cell proliferation of AR-dependent cells (LNCaP, 22Rv1, and VCaP), but not of AR-independent cells (DU145, PC3), responded strongly to MEN1 silencing. Finally, menin expression was found reduced in some human PCa. These findings highlight the regulation of the AR promoter by menin and the crosstalk between menin and the AR pathway. Our data could be useful for better understanding the increasingly reported AR-negative/NE-negative subtype of PCa and the mechanisms underlying its development.

33420374	Arginine methylation is an important posttranslational modification catalyzed by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs). However, the role of PRMTs in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression is not well understood. Here we report that non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein (NONO) is overexpressed in CRC tissue and is a potential marker for poor prognosis in CRC patients. NONO silencing resulted in decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells, whereas overexpression had the opposite effect. In a xenograft model, tumors derived from NONO-deficient CRC cells were smaller than those derived from wild-type (WT) cells, and PRMT1 inhibition blocked CRC xenograft progression. A mass spectrometry analysis indicated that NONO is a substrate of PRMT1. R251 of NONO was asymmetrically dimethylated by PRMT1 in vitro and in vivo. Compared to NONO WT cells, NONO R251K mutant-expressing CRC cells showed reduced proliferation, migration, and invasion, and PRMT1 knockdown or pharmacological inhibition abrogated the malignant phenotype associated with NONO asymmetric dimethylation in both KRAS WT and mutant CRC cells. Compared to adjacent normal tissue, PRMT1 was highly expressed in the CRC zone in clinical specimens, which was correlated with poor overall survival in patients with locally advanced CRC. These results demonstrate that PRMT1-mediated methylation of NONO at R251 promotes CRC growth and metastasis, and suggest that PRMT1 inhibition may be an effective therapeutic strategy for CRC treatment regardless of KRAS mutation status.

33420360	TAS4464, a potent, selective small molecule NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor, leads to inactivation of cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) and consequent accumulations of its substrate proteins. Here, we investigated the antitumor properties and action mechanism of TAS4464 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). TAS4464 induced apoptotic cell death in various AML cell lines. TAS4464 treatments resulted in the activation of both the caspase-9-mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathway and caspase-8-mediated extrinsic apoptotic pathway in AML cells; combined treatment with inhibitors of these caspases markedly diminished TAS4464-induced apoptosis. In each apoptotic pathway, TAS4464 induced the mRNA transcription of the intrinsic proapoptotic factor NOXA and decreased that of the extrinsic antiapoptotic factor c-FLIP. RNA-sequencing analysis showed that the signaling pathway of the CRL substrate c-Myc was enriched after TAS4464 treatment. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed that TAS4464-induced c-Myc bound to the PMAIP1 (encoding NOXA) and CFLAR (encoding c-FLIP) promoter regions, and siRNA-mediated c-Myc knockdown neutralized both TAS4464-mediated NOXA induction and c-FLIP downregulation. TAS4464 activated both caspase-8 and caspase-9 along with an increase in NOXA and a decrease in c-FLIP, resulting in complete tumor remission in a human AML xenograft model. These findings suggest that NAE inhibition leads to anti-AML activity via a novel c-Myc-dependent apoptosis induction mechanism.

33452460	High Mobility Group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) is a chromatin modifier and its overexpression has been found in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Level of Hmga2 expression is fine-tuned by Lin28b-Let-7 axis and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, in which deletion of Ezh2 leads to activation of Hmga2 expression in hematopoietic stem cells. To elucidate the mechanisms by which the overexpression of HMGA2 helps transformation of stem cells harboring a driver mutation of TET2, we generated an Hmga2-expressing Tet2-deficient mouse model showing the progressive phenotypes of MDS and AML. The overexpression of Hmga2 remodeled the transcriptional program of Tet2-deficient stem and progenitor cells, leading to the impaired differentiation of myeloid cells. Furthermore, Hmga2 was bound to a proximal region of Igf2bp2 oncogene, and activated its transcription, leading to enhancing self-renewal of Tet2-deficient stem cells that was suppressed by inhibition of the DNA binding of Hmga2. These combinatory effects on the transcriptional program and cellular function were not redundant to those in Tet2-deficient cells. The present results elucidate that Hmga2 targets key oncogenic pathways during the transformation and highlight the Hmga2-Igf2bp2 axis as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

33510354	While the androgen receptor (AR) may influence the progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), its role to impact vasculogenic mimicry (VM) to alter the ccRCC progression and metastasis remains obscure. Here, we demonstrated that elevated AR expression was positively correlated with tumor-originated vasculogenesis in ccRCC patients. Consistently, in vitro research revealed AR promoted VM formation in ccRCC cell lines via modulating lncRNA-TANAR/TWIST1 signals. Mechanism dissection showed that AR could increase lncRNA-TANAR (TANAR) expression through binding to the androgen response elements (AREs) located in its promoter region. Moreover, we found that TANAR could impede nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) of TWIST1 mRNA by direct interaction with TWIST1 5'UTR. A preclinical study using in vivo mouse model with orthotopic xenografts of ccRCC cells further confirmed the in vitro data. Together, these results illustrated that AR-mediated TANAR signals might play a crucial role in ccRCC VM formation and metastasis, and targeting this newly identified AR/TANAR/TWIST1 signaling may help in the development of a novel anti-angiogenesis therapy to better suppress the ccRCC progression.

33564074	Metastasis is the fundamental cause of cancer mortality, but there are still very few anti-metastatic drugs available. Endosomal trafficking has been implicated in tumor metastasis, and we have previously found that small chemical vacuolin-1 (V1) potently inhibits autophagosome-lysosome fusion and general endosomal-lysosomal degradation. Here, we assessed the anti-metastatic activity of V1 both in vitro and in vivo. V1 significantly inhibits colony formation, migration, and invasion of various cancer cells in vitro. It also compromises the assembly-disassembly dynamics of focal adhesions (FAs) by inhibiting the recycling and degradation of integrins. In various experimental or transgenic mouse models, V1 significantly suppresses the metastasis and/or tumor growth of breast cancer or melanoma. We further identified capping protein Zbeta (CapZbeta) as a V1 binding protein and showed that it is required for the V1-mediated inhibition of migration and metastasis of cancer cells. Collectively, our results indicate that V1 targets CapZbeta to inhibit endosomal trafficking and metastasis.	Vacuolin-1 inhibits endosomal trafficking and metastasis via CapZbeta.	Oncogene	1
33603169	Uncovering the mechanisms that underpin how tumor cells adapt to microenvironmental stress is essential to better understand cancer progression. The HACE1 (HECT domain and ankyrin repeat-containing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase) gene is a tumor suppressor that inhibits the growth, invasive capacity, and metastasis of cancer cells. However, the direct regulatory pathways whereby HACE1 confers this tumor-suppressive effect remain to be fully elucidated. In this report, we establish a link between HACE1 and the major stress factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1alpha). We find that HACE1 blocks the accumulation of HIF1alpha during cellular hypoxia through decreased protein stability. This property is dependent on HACE1 E3 ligase activity and loss of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1), an established target of HACE1 mediated ubiquitinylation and degradation. In vivo, genetic deletion of Rac1 reversed the increased HIF1alpha expression observed in Hace1(-/-) mice in murine KRas(G12D)-driven lung tumors. An inverse relationship was observed between HACE1 and HIF1alpha levels in tumors compared to patient-matched normal kidney tissues, highlighting the potential pathophysiological significance of our findings. Together, our data uncover a previously unrecognized function for the HACE1 tumor suppressor in blocking HIF1alpha accumulation under hypoxia in a RAC1-dependent manner.

33603163	Tumor-stroma interactions are important determinants for the disease course in cancer. While stromal influence has been known to often play a tumor-promoting role, incomplete mechanistic insight into this phenomenon has prevented its therapeutic targeting. Stromal fibroblasts can be activated by tumor cells to differentiate into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), that exhibit the traits of myofibroblasts, and in turn, they increase cancer aggressiveness. Here, we report the crosstalk between the cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts that leads to tumor progression. The process is initiated by secretion of a chemokine like protein, osteopontin (OPN) from the cancer cells that differentiates the fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. Tumor-derived OPN achieves this transition by engaging CD44 and alphavbeta3 integrins on the fibroblast surface, which mediates signaling via Akt and ERK to induce Twist1-dependent gene expression. The OPN-driven CAFs then secrete CXCL12, which in turn triggers epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the tumor cells. OPN, produced by the cancer cells, and CXCL12, secreted by activated fibroblasts, are necessary and sufficient to perpetuate the crosstalk. Knocking out OPN in carcinogen-induced mammary tumors or knocking down OPN in cancer cells and fibroblast co-implanted xenografts abrogates myofibroblast differentiation, Twist1, and CXCL12 expression. OPN expression is correlated with CAF-specific gene signature as shown by breast tumor tissue microarray consisting of 100 patient specimens. Bioinformatics analyses have confirmed that the expression of OPN is significantly correlated with the expression of myofibroblast-specific markers as demonstrated in human breast carcinoma dataset of 2509 patients. Our findings describe OPN and CXCL12 act as compelling targets to curb the tumor-promoting features of the stromal components and further suggested that OPN-regulated CXCL12 network might act as potential therapeutic target for the management of CAF-mediated breast cancer progression.

33654196	Progression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes a major unresolved clinical challenge, and effective targeted therapies are lacking. Because microtubule dynamics play pivotal roles in breast cancer metastasis, we performed RNA sequencing on 245 samples from TNBC patients to characterize the landscape of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). Here, our transcriptome analyses revealed that low expression of one MAP, tektin4, indicated poor patient outcomes. Tektin4 loss led to a marked increase in TNBC migration, invasion, and metastasis and a decrease in microtubule stability. Mechanistically, we identified a novel microtubule-associated complex containing tektin4 and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Tektin4 loss increased the interaction between HDAC6 and alpha-tubulin, thus decreasing microtubule stability through HDAC6-mediated tubulin deacetylation. Significantly, we found that tektin4 loss sensitized TNBC cells, xenograft models, and patient-derived organoid models to the HDAC6-selective inhibitor ACY1215. Furthermore, tektin4 expression levels were positively correlated with microtubule stability levels in clinical samples. Together, our findings uncover a metastasis suppressor function of tektin4 and support clinical development of HDAC6 inhibition as a new therapeutic strategy for tektin4-deficient TNBC patients.

33649538	Mdm2 antagonizes the tumor suppressor p53. Targeting the Mdm2-p53 interaction represents an attractive approach for the treatment of cancers with functional p53. Investigating mechanisms underlying Mdm2-p53 regulation is therefore important. The scaffold protein beta-arrestin2 (beta-arr2) regulates tumor suppressor p53 by counteracting Mdm2. beta-arr2 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling displaces Mdm2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm resulting in enhanced p53 signaling. beta-arr2 is constitutively exported from the nucleus, via a nuclear export signal, but mechanisms regulating its nuclear entry are not completely elucidated. beta-arr2 can be SUMOylated, but no information is available on how SUMO may regulate beta-arr2 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. While we found beta-arr2 SUMOylation to be dispensable for nuclear import, we identified a non-covalent interaction between SUMO and beta-arr2, via a SUMO interaction motif (SIM), that is required for beta-arr2 cytonuclear trafficking. This SIM promotes association of beta-arr2 with the multimolecular RanBP2/RanGAP1-SUMO nucleocytoplasmic transport hub that resides on the cytoplasmic filaments of the nuclear pore complex. Depletion of RanBP2/RanGAP1-SUMO levels result in defective beta-arr2 nuclear entry. Mutation of the SIM inhibits beta-arr2 nuclear import, its ability to delocalize Mdm2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and enhanced p53 signaling in lung and breast tumor cell lines. Thus, a beta-arr2 SIM nuclear entry checkpoint, coupled with active beta-arr2 nuclear export, regulates its cytonuclear trafficking function to control the Mdm2-p53 signaling axis.	The RanBP2/RanGAP1-SUMO complex gates beta-arrestin2 nuclear entry to regulate the Mdm2-p53 signaling axis.	Oncogene	0
33627783	Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL) is a ubiquitin ligase (E3) that becomes activated upon Tyr371-phosphorylation and targets receptor protein tyrosine kinases for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Deregulation of CBL and its E3 activity is observed in myeloproliferative neoplasms and other cancers, including breast, colon, and prostate cancer. Here, we explore the oncogenic mechanism of E3-inactive CBL mutants identified in myeloproliferative neoplasms. We show that these mutants bind strongly to CIN85 under normal growth conditions and alter the CBL interactome. Lack of E3 activity deregulates CIN85 endosomal trafficking, leading to an altered transcriptome that amplifies signaling events to promote oncogenesis. Disruption of CBL mutant interactions with EGFR or CIN85 reduces oncogenic transformation. Given the importance of the CBL-CIN85 interaction in breast cancers, we examined the expression levels of CIN85, CBL, and the status of Tyr371-phosphorylated CBL (pCBL) in human breast cancer tissue microarrays. Interestingly, pCBL shows an inverse correlation with both CIN85 and CBL, suggesting that high expression of inactivated CBL could coordinate with CIN85 for breast cancer progression. Inhibition of the CBL-CIN85 interaction with a proline-rich peptide of CBL that binds CIN85 reduced the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. Together, these results provide a rationale for exploring the potential of targeting the EGFR-CBL-CIN85 axis in CBL-inactivated mutant cancers.

33658628	Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have successfully revealed many common risk variants for bladder cancer, the heritability is still largely unexplained. We hypothesized that low-frequency variants involved in bladder cancer risk could reveal the unexplained heritability. Next-generation sequencing of 113 patients and 118 controls was conducted on 81 genes/regions of known bladder cancer GWAS loci. A two-stage validation comprising 3,350 cases and 4,005 controls was performed to evaluate the effects of low-frequency variants on bladder cancer risk. Biological experiments and techniques, including electrophoretic mobility shift assays, CRISPR/Cas9, RNA-Seq, and bioinformatics approaches, were performed to assess the potential functions of low-frequency variants. The low-frequency variant rs28898617 was located in the first exon of UGT1A3 and was significantly associated with increased bladder cancer risk (odds ratio = 1.50, P = 3.10 x 10(-6)). Intriguingly, rs28898617 was only observed in the Asian population, but monomorphism was observed in the European population. The risk-associated G allele of rs28898617 increased UGT1A3 expression, facilitated UGT1A3 transcriptional activity, and enhanced the binding activity. In addition, UGT1A3 deletion significantly inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration of bladder cancer cells and xenograft tumor growth. Mechanistically, UGT1A3 induced LAMC2 expression by binding CBP and promoting histone acetylation, which remarkably promoted the progression of bladder cancer. This is the first targeted sequencing study to reveal that the novel low-frequency variant rs28898617 and its associated gene UGT1A3 are involved in bladder cancer development, providing new insights into the genetic architecture of bladder cancer.

33658627	Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are effective in MYCN-driven cancers, because of a unique need for HDAC recruitment by the MYCN oncogenic signal. However, HDAC inhibitors are much more effective in combination with other anti-cancer agents. To identify novel compounds which act synergistically with HDAC inhibitor, such as suberanoyl hydroxamic acid (SAHA), we performed a cell-based, high-throughput drug screen of 10,560 small molecule compounds from a drug-like diversity library and identified a small molecule compound (SE486-11) which synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic effects of SAHA. Effects of drug combinations on cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis and colony forming were assessed in a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines. Treatment with SAHA and SE486-11 increased MYCN ubiquitination and degradation, and markedly inhibited tumorigenesis in neuroblastoma xenografts, and, MYCN transgenic zebrafish and mice. The combination reduced ubiquitin-specific protease 5 (USP5) levels and increased unanchored polyubiquitin chains. Overexpression of USP5 rescued neuroblastoma cells from the cytopathic effects of the combination and reduced unanchored polyubiquitin, suggesting USP5 is a therapeutic target of the combination. SAHA and SE486-11 directly bound to USP5 and the drug combination exhibited a 100-fold higher binding to USP5 than individual drugs alone in microscale thermophoresis assays. MYCN bound to the USP5 promoter and induced USP5 gene expression suggesting that USP5 and MYCN expression created a forward positive feedback loop in neuroblastoma cells. Thus, USP5 acts as an oncogenic cofactor with MYCN in neuroblastoma and the novel combination of HDAC inhibitor with SE486-11 represents a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma.

33654198	Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma (PPARG) is one of the three members of the PPAR family of transcription factors. Besides its roles in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism, we recently demonstrated an association between PPARG and metastasis in prostate cancer. In this study a functional effect of PPARG on AKT serine/threonine kinase 3 (AKT3), which ultimately results in a more aggressive disease phenotype was identified. AKT3 has previously been shown to regulate PPARG co-activator 1 alpha (PGC1alpha) localisation and function through its action on chromosome maintenance region 1 (CRM1). AKT3 promotes PGC1alpha localisation to the nucleus through its inhibitory effects on CRM1, a known nuclear export protein. Collectively our results demonstrate how PPARG over-expression drives an increase in AKT3 levels, which in turn has the downstream effect of increasing PGC1alpha localisation within the nucleus, driving mitochondrial biogenesis. Furthermore, this increase in mitochondrial mass provides higher energetic output in the form of elevated ATP levels which may fuel the progression of the tumour cell through epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and ultimately metastasis.

33686242	LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) is a serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase that is predominantly located in the cytoplasm. In our study, nuclear translocation of LIMK1 in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples was demonstrated for the first time, especially in samples from those with intravascular tumour thrombus. LIMK1 was overexpressed in HCC tissues, and nuclear LIMK1 expression was associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. Although the effects of cytoplasmic LIMK1 on cofilin phosphorylation and actin filament dynamics have been well studied, the function of nuclear LIMK1 is still unclear. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed both in vitro and in vivo and demonstrated a correlation between nuclear LIMK1 and the enhanced aggressive phenotype of HCC. EGF could drive the nuclear translocation of LIMK1 by activating the interaction of p-ERK and LIMK1 and facilitating their roles in nuclear shuttling. Moreover, nuclear LIMK1 could directly bind to the promoter region of c-Myc and stimulate c-Myc transcription. Although the EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab has a poor therapeutic effect on advanced HCC patients, in vivo animal study showed that cetuximab achieved a significant inhibitory effect on the progression of nuclear LIMK1-overexpressing HCC cells. In addition, recent data have demonstrated the potential of cetuximab in combination therapy for HCC patients with LIMK1 nuclear translocation.

33686240	Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignancy of the bone that predominantly affects children and adolescents. Hippo pathway is a crucial regulator of organ size and tumorigenesis. However, how Hippo pathway regulates the occurrence of osteosarcoma is largely unknown. Here, we reported the regulator of G protein signaling protein 12 (RGS12) is a novel Hippo pathway regulator and tumor suppressor of osteosarcoma. Depletion of Rgs12 promotes osteosarcoma progression and lung metastasis in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model. Our data showed that the knockdown of RGS12 upregulates Ezrin expression through promoting the GNA12/13-RhoA-YAP pathway. Moreover, RGS12 negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of YAP/TEAD1 complex through its PDZ domain function to inhibit the expression and function of the osteosarcoma marker Ezrin. PDZ domain peptides of RGS12 can inhibit the development of intratibial tumor and lung metastases. Collectively, this study identifies that the RGS12 is a novel tumor suppressor in osteosarcoma through inhibiting YAP-TEAD1-Ezrin signaling pathway and provides a proof of principle that targeting RGS12 may be a therapeutic strategy for osteosarcoma.

33714984	Emerging evidence has demonstrated that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play critical roles in the development and progression of human cancer. However, the biological functions and underlying mechanisms of circRNAs in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain to be investigated. In our present study, we found that the novel circRNA circHIF1A was significantly overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and that it was associated with metastasis, poor prognosis, and the TNBC subtype. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were conducted to investigate the biological roles of circHIF1A in TNBC. Overexpression of circHIF1A significantly promoted TNBC growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo, while knockdown of circHIF1A exerted the opposite effects. Mechanistically, circHIF1A modulated the expression and translocation of NFIB through posttranscriptional and posttranslational modifications, resulting in the activation of the AKT/STAT3 signaling pathway and inhibition of P21. The RNA binding protein FUS could regulate the biogenesis of circHIF1A by interacting with the flanking intron, and FUS was transcriptionally regulated by NFIB, thus forming the circHIF1A/NFIB/FUS positive feedback loop. Moreover, circHIF1A could be packaged into exosomes and was upregulated in the plasma of breast cancer patients. Our findings indicated that circHIF1A played a critical role in the growth and metastasis of TNBC via a positive feedback loop and that circHIF1A could be a promising biomarker for breast cancer diagnosis and a potential therapeutic target for TNBC treatment.

33712705	Cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy is the recommended treatment for local advanced cervical cancer, but radioresistance remains one of the most important and unresolved clinical problems. Investigations have revealed aberrant epigenetic modifications as one of the chief culprits for the development of radioresistance. Here, we attempt to identify a radiosensitizer from an epigenetic drug synergy screen and explore the underlying mechanism. We integrated epigenetic inhibitors and radiotherapy in cervical cancer cell lines to identify potential radiosensitizers. We further verified the sensitization effect of the drug and the function of its target gene both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we validated the clinical significance of its target gene in clinical cervical cancer specimens. We identified JQ1, a BRD4 inhibitor, as a potent radiosensitizer. Functional assays demonstrated that repressing BRD4 activity led to significant radiosensitization and potentiation of DNA damage in cervical cancer cell lines. By using RNA-seq to determine JQ1-mediated changes in transcription, we identified RAD51AP1 as a major BRD4 target gene involved in radiosensitivity. A dual-luciferase reporter assay and ChIP-qPCR showed that BRD4 binds to the promoter region of RAD51AP1 and promotes its transcription, whereas this activity was attenuated by BRD4 inhibition. The in vivo experiments also suggested a synergy between BRD4 inhibition and radiotherapy. High BRD4 expression was found to be related to a worse prognosis and radiation resistance. BRD4 inhibition sensitizes cervical cancer to radiotherapy by inhibiting RAD51AP1 transcription. The combination of JQ1 with radiotherapy merits further evaluation as a therapeutic strategy for improving local control in cervical cancer.

33742125	Tumor angiogenesis plays vital roles in tumorigenesis and development; regulatory mechanism of angiogenesis is still not been fully elucidated. NSD2, a histone methyltransferase catalyzing di-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36, has been proved a critical molecule in proliferation, metastasis, and tumorigenesis. But its role in tumor angiogenesis remains unknown. Here we demonstrated that NSD2 promoted tumor angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we confirmed that the angiogenic function of NSD2 was mediated by STAT3. Momentously, we found that NSD2 promoted the methylation and activation of STAT3. In addition, mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis assays revealed that NSD2 methylated STAT3 at lysine 163 (K163). Meanwhile, K to R mutant at K163 of STAT3 attenuated the activation and angiogenic function of STAT3. Taken together, we conclude that methylation of STAT3 catalyzed by NSD2 promotes the activation of STAT3 pathway and enhances the ability of tumor angiogenesis. Our findings investigate a NSD2-dependent methylation-phosphorylation regulation pattern of STAT3 and reveal that NSD2/STAT3/VEGFA axis might be a potential target for tumor therapy.

33742122	Cancer stem cells (CSC) play a pivotal role in cancer metastasis and resistance to therapy. Previously, we compared the phosphoproteomes of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) enriched subpopulation and non-BCSCs sorted from breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX), and identified a function unknown protein, transmembrane and coiled-coil domain family 3 (TMCC3) to be a potential enrichment marker for BCSCs. We demonstrated greater expression of TMCC3 in BCSCs than non-BCSCs and higher expression of TMCC3 in metastatic lymph nodes and lungs than in primary tumor of breast cancer PDXs. TMCC3 silencing suppressed mammosphere formation, ALDH activity and cell migration in vitro, along with reduced tumorigenicity and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that AKT activation was reduced by TMCC3 silencing, but enhanced by TMCC3 overexpression. We further demonstrated that TMCC3 interacted directly with AKT through its 1-153 a.a. domain by cell-free biochemical assay in vitro and co-immunoprecipitation and interaction domain mapping assays in vivo. Based on domain truncation studies, we showed that the AKT-interacting domain of TMCC3 was essential for TMCC3-induced AKT activation, self-renewal, and metastasis. Clinically, TMCC3 mRNA expression in 202 breast cancer specimens as determined by qRT-PCR assay showed that higher TMCC3 expression correlated with poorer clinical outcome of breast cancer, including early-stage breast cancer. Multivariable analysis identified TMCC3 expression as an independent risk factor for survival. These findings suggest that TMCC3 is crucial for maintenance of BCSCs features through AKT regulation, and TMCC3 expression has independent prognostic significance in breast cancer. Thus, TMCC3 may serve as a new target for therapy directed against CSCs.	Transmembrane and coiled-coil domain family 3 (TMCC3) regulates breast cancer stem cell and AKT activation.	Oncogene	0
33742120	Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a highly fatal malignancy characterized by a vast amount of intra-tumoral fibroblasts. These fibroblasts are potentially implicated in maintaining the high aggressiveness of ICC, whereas its pro-cancer mechanisms remain scarcely reported. Here, by establishing co-culture models of ICC cells and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), we identified that HSCs triggered the expression of nuclear receptor family 4 subgroup A member 2 (NR4A2), a transcription factor previously reported as a molecular switch between inflammation and cancer, in ICC cells. Functionally, NR4A2 promotes tumor proliferation, metastatic potentiality and represents an independent prognostic indicator for overall survival in ICC patients. Mechanistically, NR4A2 upregulates osteopontin (OPN) expression through transcriptional activation and thereby augments the activity of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Intriguingly, in the context of co-culture, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a previously proved NR4A2 stimulus, not only enhances NR4A2 expression, but also can be blunted by the interference of the NR4A2-OPN axis. Altogether, this study suggests the NR4A2/OPN/Wnt signaling axis to be a pivotal executor of HSC-instigated cancer-promoting roles in ICC, and the NR4A2/OPN/VEGF positive feedback loop may help to reinforce the effect.	Hepatic stellate cells promote intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma progression via NR4A2/osteopontin/Wnt signaling axis.	Oncogene	0
33850265	Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase domain constitutively activate EGFR resulting in lung tumorigenesis. Activated EGFR modulates downstream signaling by altering phosphorylation-driven interactions that promote growth and survival. Secretory carrier membrane proteins (SCAMPs) are a family of transmembrane proteins that regulate recycling of receptor proteins, including EGFR. The potential role of SCAMPs in mutant EGFR function and tumorigenesis has not been elucidated. Using quantitative mass-spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics, we identified SCAMP3 as a target of mutant EGFRs in lung adenocarcinoma and sought to further investigate the role of SCAMP3 in the regulation of lung tumorigenesis. Here we show that activated EGFR, either directly or indirectly phosphorylates SCAMP3 at Y86 and this phosphorylation increases the interaction of SCAMP3 with both wild-type and mutant EGFRs. SCAMP3 knockdown increases lung adenocarcinoma cell survival and increases xenograft tumor growth in vivo, demonstrating a tumor suppressor role of SCAMP3 in lung tumorigenesis. The tumor suppressor function is a result of SCAMP3 promoting EGFR degradation and attenuating MAP kinase signaling pathways. SCAMP3 knockdown also increases multinucleated cells in culture, suggesting that SCAMP3 is required for efficient cytokinesis. The enhanced growth, increased colony formation, reduced EGFR degradation and multinucleation phenotype of SCAMP3-depleted cells were reversed by re-expression of wild-type SCAMP3, but not SCAMP3 Y86F, suggesting that Y86 phosphorylation is critical for SCAMP3 function. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that SCAMP3 functions as a novel tumor suppressor in lung cancer by modulating EGFR signaling and cytokinesis that is partly Y86 phosphorylation-dependent.	SCAMP3 is a mutant EGFR phosphorylation target and a tumor suppressor in lung adenocarcinoma.	Oncogene	0
33767435	In solid cancers, high expression of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) is associated with stemness, invasiveness, and resistance to chemotherapy, but the role of PrPC in tumor response to radiotherapy is unknown. Here, we show that, in neuroblastoma, breast, and colorectal cancer cell lines, PrPC expression is increased after ionizing radiation (IR) and that PrPC deficiency increases radiation sensitivity and decreases radiation-induced radioresistance in tumor cells. In neuroblastoma cells, IR activates ATM that triggers TAK1-dependent phosphorylation of JNK and subsequent activation of the AP-1 transcription factor that ultimately increases PRNP promoter transcriptional activity through an AP-1 binding site in the PRNP promoter. Importantly, we show that this ATM-TAK1-PrPC pathway mediated radioresistance is activated in all tumor cell lines studied and that pharmacological inhibition of TAK1 activity recapitulates the effects of PrPC deficiency. Altogether, these results unveil how tumor cells activate PRNP to acquire resistance to radiotherapy and might have implications for therapeutic targeting of solid tumors radioresistance.	Tumor resistance to radiotherapy is triggered by an ATM/TAK1-dependent-increased expression of the cellular prion protein.	Oncogene	0
33931741	TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway plays an important role in EMT during cancer progression. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in various behaviors of cancer cells, including EMT. Here, we report a novel lncRNA adjacent to Smad3, named Smad3-associated long non-coding RNA (SMASR). SMASR is downregulated by TGF-beta via Smad2/3 in lung cancer cells. Knockdown of SMASR induces EMT and increases the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells. Moreover, knockdown of SMASR promotes the phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Mechanistically, SMASR interacts with Smad2/3 and inhibits the expression of TGFBR1, the TGF-beta type I receptor responsible for phosphorylation of Smad2/3, thus leading to inactivation of TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway. Clinically, SMASR is downregulated in lung cancer tissues. Collectively, our findings prove a critical role of SMASR in EMT of lung cancer by forming a negative feedback loop with TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway.	Long non-coding RNA SMASR inhibits the EMT by negatively regulating TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway in lung cancer.	Oncogene	0
33911205	Lung cancer is one of the most intractable diseases with high incidence and mortality worldwide. Adenylate cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1), a well-known actin depolymerization factor, is recently reported to be an oncogene accelerating cancer cell proliferation. However, the physiological significance of CAP1 in lung cancer is incompletely understood and the novel functions of CAP1 in transcriptional regulation remain unknown. Here we found that CAP1 was highly expressed in lung cancer tissues and cells, which was also negatively associated with prognosis in lung cancer patients. Moreover, CAP1 promoted A549 cells proliferation by promoting protein synthesis to accelerate cell cycle progression. Mechanistically, we revealed that CAP1 facilitated cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9)-mediated RNA polymerases (Pol) II-Ser2 phosphorylation and subsequent transcription elongation, and CAP1 performed its function in this progress depending on its actin-depolymerization activity in nucleoplasm. Furthermore, our in vivo findings confirmed that CAP1-promoted A549 xenograft tumor growth was associated with CDK9-mediated Pol II-Ser2 phosphorylation. Our study elucidates a novel role of CAP1 in modulating transcription by promoting polymerase II phosphorylation and suggests that CAP1 is a newly identified biomarker for lung cancer treatment and prognosis prediction.

33972683	N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most abundant internal mRNA modification in eukaryotes and plays an important role in tumorigenesis. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. Here, we established a cell model of rapamycin-induced autophagy to screen m(6)A-modifying enzymes. We found that m(6)A demethylase fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) plays a key role in regulating autophagy and tumorigenesis by targeting the gene encoding eukaryotic translation initiation factor gamma 1 (eIF4G1) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Knocked down of FTO expression in OSCC cell lines, resulting in downregulation of eIF4G1 along with enhanced autophagic flux and inhibition of tumorigenesis. Rapamycin inhibited FTO activity, and directly targeted eIF4G1 transcripts and mediated their expression in an m(6)A-dependent manner. Dual-luciferase reporter and mutagenesis assays confirmed that YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA-binding protein 2 (YTHDF2) targets eIF4G1. Conclusively, after FTO silencing, YTHDF2 captured eIF4G1 transcripts containing m(6)A, resulting in mRNA degradation and decreased expression of eIF4G1 protein, thereby promoting autophagy and reducing tumor occurrence. Therefore, rapamycin may regulate m(6)A levels, determining the autophagic flux of OSCC, thereby affecting the biological characteristics of cancer cells. This insight expands our understanding of the crosstalk between autophagy and RNA methylation in tumorigenesis, which is essential for therapeutic strategy development for OSCC.

33958720	Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of human mortality around the world. We have previously shown that Galphai1 (the inhibitory subunit 1 of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein) recruitment to ligand-activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is essential for signaling. Testing its role in GC cancer-promoting functions, we found that Galphai1 is upregulated in human GC, correlating with poor overall survival. In established and primary human GC cells, Galphai1 shRNA (small hairpin RNA) or knockout produced significant anti-GC cell activity, proliferation and migration was inhibited, and apoptosis was activated. Conversely, ectopic Galphai1 overexpression promoted proliferation and migration of GC cells in vitro. By examining the tumor-suppressive miRNA microRNA-200a (miR-200a), we found that miR-200a directly silenced Galphai1 to induce anti-GC cell activity. The expression of miR-200a was downregulated in human GC, correlating with upregulation of a novel miR-200a-targeting long non-coding RNA (LncRNA), PINK1 (PTEN Induced Kinase 1)-AS. RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA-pull down, and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization assays confirmed that PINK1-AS directly binds to miR-200a. Silencing PINK1-AS in GC cells led to miR-200a accumulation, Galphai1 downregulation, and inhibition of GC cell progression in vitro, whereas PINK1-AS upregulation produced the converse results. Significantly, anti-GC cell activity induced by PINK1-AS shRNA was ameliorated by the expression of miR-200a antisense or the 3'-UTR (untranslated region)-depleted Galphai1. In vivo, the growth of subcutaneous MGC-803 xenografts in nude mice was inhibited by PINK1-AS shRNA, but accelerated by PINK1-AS overexpression. Patient-derived GC xenograft growth in nude mice was largely inhibited after intratumoral injection of PINK1-AS shRNA lentivirus. In conclusion, PINK1-AS promotes Galphai1-driven GC progression by sponging miR-200a.	LncRNA PINK1-AS promotes Galphai1-driven gastric cancer tumorigenesis by sponging microRNA-200a.	Oncogene	0
33990700	5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC) but is hampered by chemoresistance. Despite its impact on patient survival, the mechanism underlying chemoresistance against 5-FU remains poorly understood. Here, we identified serine hydroxymethyltransferase-2 (SHMT2) as a critical regulator of 5-FU chemoresistance in CRC. SHMT2 inhibits autophagy by binding cytosolic p53 instead of metabolism. SHMT2 prevents cytosolic p53 degradation by inhibiting the binding of p53 and HDM2. Under 5-FU treatment, SHMT2 depletion promotes autophagy and inhibits apoptosis. Autophagy inhibitors decrease low SHMT2-induced 5-FU resistance in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the lethality of 5-FU treatment to CRC cells was enhanced by treatment with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine in patient-derived and CRC cell xenograft models. Taken together, our findings indicate that autophagy induced by low SHMT2 levels mediates 5-FU resistance in CRC. These results reveal the SHMT2-p53 interaction as a novel therapeutic target and provide a potential opportunity to reduce chemoresistance.

33986510	The mortality rate of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is higher than that of other cancers worldwide owing to a lack of therapeutic targets and related drugs. This study aimed to find new drugs by targeting an efficacious therapeutic target in ESCC patients. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is hyperactive in ESCC. Herein, we identified a novel STAT3 inhibitor, periplogenin, which strongly inhibited phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705. Docking models and pull-down assays revealed that periplogenin bound directly and specifically to STAT3, leading to significant suppression of subsequent dimerization, nuclear import, and transcription activities. In addition, STAT3 knockdown cell lines were insensitive to periplogenin, whereas in contrast, STAT3-overexpressing cells were more sensitive to periplogenin, indicating that STAT3 was a target of periplogenin. Intraperitoneally administered periplogenin exhibited efficacious therapeutic effects in ESCC patient-derived xenograft models and dramatically impaired the phosphorylation of STAT3 and expression levels of STAT3-mediated downstream genes. Thus, our study demonstrated that periplogenin acted as a new STAT3 inhibitor, suppressing the growth of ESCC in vitro and in vivo, providing a basis for its potential application in ESCC treatment and prevention.

33981001	The heat shock protein GRP78 typically resides in the endoplasmic reticulum in normal tissues, but it has been shown to be expressed on the cell surface of several cancer cells, and some stem cells, where it can act as a signaling molecule by not-yet-fully defined mechanisms. Although cell surface GRP78 (sGRP78) has emerged as an attractive chemotherapeutic target, understanding how sGRP78 is functioning in cancer has been complicated by the fact that sGRP78 can function in a cell-context dependent manner, with a diverse array of reported binding partners, to regulate a variety of cellular responses. We had previously shown that sGRP78 was important in regulating pluripotent stem cell (PSC) functions, and hypothesized that embryonic-like mechanisms of GRP78 were critical to regulating aggressive breast cancer cell functions. Here, using proteomics we identify Dermcidin (DCD) as a novel sGRP78 binding partner common to both PSCs and breast cancer cells. We show that GRP78 and DCD cooperate to regulate stem cell and cancer cell migration that is dependent on the cell surface functions of these proteins. Finally, we identify Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, a critical pathway in stem cell and cancer cell biology, as an important downstream intermediate in regulating this migration phenotype.

34079084	Invasion and metastasis are the leading causes of death in patients with breast cancer (BC), and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) plays an essential role in this process. Here, we found that Lnc-408, a novel long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), is significantly upregulated in BC cells undergoing EMT and in BC tumor with lymphatic metastases compared with those without lymphatic metastases. Lnc-408 can enhance BC invasion and metastasis by regulating the expression of LIMK1. Mechanistically, Lnc-408 serves as a sponge for miR-654-5p to relieve the suppression of miR-654-5p on its target LIMK1. Knockdown or knockout of Lnc-408 in invasive BC cells clearly decreased LIMK1 levels, and ectopic Lnc-408 in MCF-7 cells increased LIMK1 expression to promote cell invasion. Lnc-408-mediated enhancement of LIMK1 plays a key role in cytoskeletal stability and promotes invadopodium formation in BC cells via p-cofilin/F-actin. In addition, the increased LIMK1 also facilitates the expression of MMP2, ITGB1, and COL1A1 by phosphorylating CREB. In conclusion, our findings reveal that Lnc-408 promotes BC invasion and metastasis via the Lnc-408/miR-654-5p/LIMK1 axis, highlighting a novel promising target for the diagnosis and treatment of BC.

34017079	Presence of inflammatory factors in the tumor microenvironment is well-documented yet their specific role in tumorigenesis is elusive. The core inflammatory pathways like the Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) and the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) pathway are conserved in Drosophila. We induced GFP-marked epithelial tumors by expressing activated oncogenic forms of Ras(V12) or Yorkie (Yki(3SA), mammalian YAP) in scribble deficient cells (scrib(RNAi), mammalian SCRIB) to study the role of inflammatory factors in tumorigenesis. Similar to Ras(V12)scrib(RNAi), we found that Yki(3SA)scrib(RNAi) form invasive neoplastic lethal tumors that induce a systemic inflammatory response. We identified Cactus (Cact, mammalian IkappaBalpha), the negative regulator of TLR, as a key player in tumor growth. Cact accumulates in the cytoplasm in Drosophila tumor models, similar to squamous cell carcinoma in mice models and human patients where cytoplasmic IkappaBalpha favors oncogenic transformation. Further, cact is transcriptionally upregulated in tumors, and downregulation of Cact affects tumor growth. We investigated if TLR or TNF pathway affect tumor growth through activation of Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) pathway and its target Matrix Metalloprotease1 (MMP1). Genetically manipulating levels of TLR components or TNF receptors showed that Cact acts upstream of JNK signaling and regulates JNK via a non-canonical mechanism during tumorigenesis. Further, Hippo coactivator Yki transcriptionally regulates cact expression, and downregulation of Yki or Cact is sufficient to cause downregulation of JNK-mediated signaling that promotes tumorigenesis. Here, we report a link between Hippo, IkappaBalpha and JNK signaling that may induce inflammation and innate immune response in tumorigenesis.

34017078	ING2 (Inhibitor of Growth 2) is a tumor suppressor gene that has been implicated in critical biological functions (cell-cycle regulation, replicative senescence, DNA repair and DNA replication), most of which are recognized hallmarks of tumorigenesis occurring in the cell nucleus. As its close homolog ING1 has been recently observed in the mitochondrial compartment, we hypothesized that ING2 could also translocate into the mitochondria and be involved in new biological functions. In the present study, we demonstrate that ING2 is imported in the inner mitochondrial fraction in a redox-sensitive manner in human cells and that this mechanism is modulated by 14-3-3eta protein expression. Remarkably, ING2 is necessary to maintain mitochondrial ultrastructure integrity without interfering with mitochondrial networks or polarization. We observed an interaction between ING2 and mtDNA under basal conditions. This interaction appears to be mediated by TFAM, a critical regulator of mtDNA integrity. The loss of mitochondrial ING2 does not impair mtDNA repair, replication or transcription but leads to a decrease in mitochondrial ROS production, suggesting a detrimental impact on OXPHOS activity. We finally show using multiple models that ING2 is involved in mitochondrial respiration and that its loss confers a protection against mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibition in vitro. Consequently, we propose a new tumor suppressor role for ING2 protein in the mitochondria as a metabolic shift gatekeeper during tumorigenesis.	ING2 tumor suppressive protein translocates into mitochondria and is involved in cellular metabolism homeostasis.	Oncogene	0
34103685	Despite a high clinical need for the treatment of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, targeted therapies are still limited. The multifunctional enzyme Transglutaminase 2 (TGM2), which harbors transamidation and GTPase activity, has been implicated in the development and progression of different types of human cancers. However, the mechanism and role of TGM2 in colorectal cancer are poorly understood. Here, we present TGM2 as a promising drug target.In primary patient material of CRC patients, we detected an increased expression and enzymatic activity of TGM2 in colon cancer tissue in comparison to matched normal colon mucosa cells. The genetic ablation of TGM2 in CRC cell lines using shRNAs or CRISPR/Cas9 inhibited cell expansion and tumorsphere formation. In vivo, tumor initiation and growth were reduced upon genetic knockdown of TGM2 in xenotransplantations. TGM2 ablation led to the induction of Caspase-3-driven apoptosis in CRC cells. Functional rescue experiments with TGM2 variants revealed that the transamidation activity is critical for the pro-survival function of TGM2. Transcriptomic and protein-protein interaction analyses applying various methods including super-resolution and time-lapse microscopy showed that TGM2 directly binds to the tumor suppressor p53, leading to its inactivation and escape of apoptosis induction.We demonstrate here that TGM2 is an essential survival factor in CRC, highlighting the therapeutic potential of TGM2 inhibitors in CRC patients with high TGM2 expression. The inactivation of p53 by TGM2 binding indicates a general anti-apoptotic function, which may be relevant in cancers beyond CRC.

34108621	Research over the past decade has suggested important roles for pseudogenes in glioma. This study aimed to show that pseudogene PRELI domain-containing 1 pseudogene 6 (PRELID1P6) promotes glioma progression. Aberrant expression of genes was screened using The Cancer Genome Atlas database. We found that mRNA level of PRELID1P6 was highly upregulated in glioma and was associated with a shorter survival time. Functional studies showed that the knockdown of PRELID1P6 decreased cell proliferation, sphere formation, and clone formation ability and blocked the cell cycle transition at G0/G1, while overexpression of PRELID1P6 had the opposite effects. Mechanistically, knockdown of PRELID1P6 changed the cellular localization of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (hnRNPH1) from nucleus to cytoplasm, which promoted ubiquitin-mediated degradation of hnRNPH1. RNA-sequence and gene set enrichment analysis suggested that knockdown of PRELID1P6 regulates the apoptosis signaling pathway. Western blotting showed that PRELID1P6 increased TRF2 expression by hnRNPH1-mediated alternative splicing effect and activated the Akt/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, Akt inhibitor MK2206 treatment reversed the oncogenic function of PRELID1P6. PRELID1P6 was also found to be negatively regulated by miR-1825. Our result showed that PRELID1P6 promotes glioma progression through the hnHNPH1-Akt/mTOR pathway. These findings shed new light on the important role of PRELID1P6 as a novel oncogene for glioma.

34163028	The polybromo-associated PBAF (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex, which includes PBRM1, ARID2, and BRD7, regulates cell differentiation and genomic integrity. MUC1-C is an oncogenic protein that drives lineage plasticity in prostate cancer (PC) progression. The present work demonstrates that MUC1-C induces PBRM1, ARID2, and BRD7 expression by the previously unrecognized E2F1-mediated activation of their respective promoters. The functional significance of the MUC1-C-->PBAF pathway is supported by demonstrating involvement of MUC1-C in associating with nuclear PBAF and driving the NRF2 antioxidant gene transcriptome in PC cells. Mechanistically, MUC1-C forms a complex with NRF2 and PBRM1 on the NRF2 target SLC7A11 gene that encodes the xCT cystine-glutamate antiporter, increases chromatin accessibility and induces SLC7A11/xCT expression. We also show that MUC1-C and PBRM1 are necessary for induction of other NRF2 target genes, including G6PD and PGD that regulate the pentose phosphate pathway. Our results further demonstrate that MUC1-C integrates activation of PBRM1 with the regulation of antioxidant genes, ROS levels, pluripotency factor expression and the cancer stem cell (CSC) state. These findings reveal a role for MUC1-C in regulating PBAF, redox balance and lineage plasticity of PC CSC progression. Our findings also uncover involvement of MUC1-C in integrating the PBAF and BAF pathways in cancer.

34155345	The incidence of thyroid cancer is growing rapidly during the past decades worldwide. Although most thyroid tumors are curable, some patients diagnosed with distant metastases are associated with poor prognosis. The molecular mechanisms underlying these cases are still largely unknown. Here we found that the upregulated O-Linked N-Acetylglucosamine Transferase (OGT) expression and O-GlcNAcylation (O-GlcNAc) modification in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) were essential in tumor growth and metastasis. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that YAP was the effector protein modified by OGT. In details, YAP Ser109 O-GlcNAcylation promoted the malignant phenotypes in PTC cells by inducing YAP Ser127 dephosphorylation and activation. Our work clearly showed the critical role of OGT and YAP played in PTC tumors and made it possible for us to seek the clinical potential of manipulating OGT/YAP activity in PTC targeted therapies. These findings also confirmed OGT worked in collaboration with classical Hippo pathway kinases as an upstream regulator of YAP in PTC tumors.

34218271	"Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), an N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) demethylase, participates in tumor progression and metastasis in many malignancies, but its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) is still unclear. Here, we found that FTO protein levels, but not RNA levels, were downregulated in CRC tissues. Reduced FTO protein expression was correlated with a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis in resectable CRC patients. Moreover, we demonstrated that hypoxia restrained FTO protein expression, mainly due to an increase in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. The serine/threonine kinase receptor associated protein (STRAP) might served as the E3 ligase and K216 was the major ubiquitination site responsible for hypoxia-induced FTO degradation. FTO inhibited CRC metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, FTO exerted a tumor suppressive role by inhibiting metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) expression in an m(6)A-dependent manner. Methylated MTA1 transcripts were recognized by an m(6)A ""reader"", insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2), which then stabilized its mRNA. Together, our findings highlight the critical role of FTO in CRC metastasis and reveal a novel epigenetic mechanism by which the hypoxic tumor microenvironment promotes CRC metastasis."

34244606	Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) formation, which participates in the process of neovascularization, is highly activated in p53-mutated triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Here, we show that Chk2 is negatively correlated with VM formation in p53-mutated TNBC. Its activation by DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin, etoposide, and DPT reduces VM formation. Mechanistically, the Chk2-PKM2 axis plays an important role in the inhibition of VM formation at the level of metabolic regulation. Chk2 promotes the Chk2-PKM2 interaction through the Chk2 SCD (SQ/TQ cluster domain) and the PKM2 C domain. Furthermore, Chk2 promotes the nuclear export of PKM2 by phosphorylating PKM2 at Ser100. P-PKM2 S100 reduces VM formation by decreasing glucose flux, and the PKM2 S100A mutation abolishes the inhibition of glucose flux and VM formation induced by Chk2 activation. Overall, this study proposes a novel strategy of VM suppression through Chk2 induction, which prevents PKM2-mediated glucose flux in p53-mutated TNBC.

34274947	LncRNAs play essential roles in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Pseudogene UBE2CP3 is an antisense intronic lncRNA. However, the biological function of UBE2CP3 in gastric cancer (GC) remains unknown. In this study, we revealed that lncRNA UBE2CP3 was aberrantly upregulated in multiple independent gastric cancer cohorts, and its overexpression was clinically associated with poor prognosis in GC. UBE2CP3 was mainly located in cytoplasm and promoted migratory and invasive capacities of GC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanismly, a novel dysregulated ceRNA network UB2CP3/miR-138-5p/ITGA2 was identified in GC by transcriptome sequencing. Furthermore, rescue assay further confirmed that UBE2CP3 mainly promoted GC progression through miR-138-5p/ITGA2 axis. More importantly, our data proved that UBE2CP3/IGFBP7 could form an RNA duplex, thereby directly interacting with the ILF3 protein. In turn, this RNA-RNA interaction between IGFBP7 mRNA and UBE2CP3 mediated by ILF3 protein plays an essential role in protecting the mRNA stability of UBE2CP3. In addition, transcription factor ELF3 was identified to be a direct repressor of lncRNA UBE2CP3 in GC. Taken together, overexpression of UBE2CP3 promotes tumor progression via cascade amplification of ITGA2 upregulation in GC. Our finding has revealed that the dysregulation of UBE2CP3 is probably due to the downregulation of ELF3 and/or the overexpression of IGFBP7 mRNA in GC. Our findings reveal, for the first time, that UBE2CP3 plays crucial a role in GC progression by modulating miR-138-5p/ITGA2 axis, suggesting that UBE2CP3 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in GC.	The ELF3-regulated lncRNA UBE2CP3 is over-stabilized by RNA-RNA interactions and drives gastric cancer metastasis via miR-138-5p/ITGA2 axis.	Oncogene	0
34267330	Large tumour suppressor (LATS) 1/2, the core kinases of Hippo signalling, are critical for maintaining tissue homeostasis. Here, we investigate the role of SUMOylation in the regulation of LATS activation. High cell density induces the expression of components of the SUMOylation machinery and enhances the SUMOylation and activation of Lats1 but not Lats2, whereas genetic deletion of the SUMOylation E2 ligase, Ubc9, abolishes this Lats1 activation. Moreover, SUMOylation occurs at the K830 (mouse K829) residue to activate LATS1 and depends on the PIAS1/2 E3 ligase. Whereas the K830 deSUMOylation mutation of LATS1 found in the human metastatic prostate cancers eliminates the kinase activity by attenuating the formation of the phospho-MOB1/phospho-LATS1 complex. As a result, the LATS1(K830R) transgene phenocopies Yap transgene to cause the oversized livers in mice, whereas Lats1(K829R) knock-in phenocopies the deletion of Lats1 in causing the reproductive and endocrine defects and ovary tumours in mice. Thus, SUMOylation-mediated LATS1 activation is an integral component of Hippo signalling in the regulation of tissues homeostasis.

34294847	In response to oncogenic signals, Alternative Splicing (AS) regulators such as SR and hnRNP proteins show altered expression levels, subnuclear distribution and/or post-translational modification status, but the link between signals and these changes remains unknown. Here, we report that a cytosolic scaffold protein, IQGAP1, performs this task in response to heat-induced signals. We show that in gastric cancer cells, a nuclear pool of IQGAP1 acts as a tethering module for a group of spliceosome components, including hnRNPM, a splicing factor critical for the response of the spliceosome to heat-shock. IQGAP1 controls hnRNPM's sumoylation, subnuclear localisation and the relevant response of the AS machinery to heat-induced stress. Genome-wide analyses reveal that IQGAP1 and hnRNPM co-regulate the AS of a cell cycle-related RNA regulon in gastric cancer cells, thus favouring the accelerated proliferation phenotype of gastric cancer cells. Overall, we reveal a missing link between stress signals and AS regulation.	The scaffold protein IQGAP1 links heat-induced stress signals to alternative splicing regulation in gastric cancer cells.

34294845	Research has indicated that hypoxia profoundly contributes to chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer (PC), while the precise mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we report a hypoxic exosomal circular RNA (circRNA)-mediated mechanism of conferred chemoresistance in PC cells. Gemcitabine (GEM) resistance was enhanced in normoxic PC cells incubated with exosomes derived from hypoxic PC cells. CircRNA microarray displayed that circZNF91 was remarkably increased in hypoxic exosomes of PC cells compared with normoxic exosomes. Overexpression of circZNF91 obviously stimulated chemoresistance in PC cells, while knockdown of circZNF91 retarded the hypoxic exosome-transmitted chemoresistance. Mechanistically, the hypoxic-induced exosomal circZNF91 transmitted into normoxic PC cells could competitively bind to miR-23b-3p, which deprives the inhibition of miR-23b-3p on expression of deacetylase Sirtuin1 (SIRT1). Consequently, the upregulated SIRT1 enhanced deacetylation-dependent stability of HIF-1alpha protein, leading to glycolysis and GEM chemoresistance of recipient PC cells. In addition, we revealed that the increased circZNF91 in hypoxic exosome was attributed to the transcriptional regulation by HIF-1alpha. Coincidently, transmission of hypoxic exosomes into subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice obviously facilitated the chemoresistance of transplanted PC tumor, which could be reversed by depletion of circZNF91 or upregulation of miR-23b-3p. Furthermore, clinical data showed that circZNF91 was significantly upregulated in PC tissues and correlated with overexpression of glycolytic enzymes and short overall survival time. Collectively, exosomal circZNF91 can function as a cargo mediating the signal transmission between hypoxic and normoxic tumor cells to promote GEM chemoresistance of PC and may potentially serve as a therapeutic target.	Hypoxic exosomal HIF-1alpha-stabilizing circZNF91 promotes chemoresistance of normoxic pancreatic cancer cells via enhancing glycolysis.	Oncogene	1
34304250	We have previously reported that the differentiation-inducing factor-1 (DIF-1), a compound identified in Dictyostelium discoideum, suppresses the growth of MCF-7 breast cancer cells by inactivating p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70(S6K)). Therefore, we first examined whether the same mechanism operates in other breast cancer cells, especially triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive and refractory phenotype of breast cancer. We also investigated the mechanism by which DIF-1 suppresses p70(S6K) by focusing on the AMPK-mTORC1 system. We found that DIF-1 induces phosphorylation of AMPK and Raptor and dephosphorylation of p70(S6K) in multiple TNBC cell lines. Next, we examined whether AMPK-mediated inhibition of p70(S6K) leads to the suppression of proliferation and migration/infiltration of TNBC cells. DIF-1 significantly reduced the expression levels of cyclin D1 by suppressing the translation of STAT3 and strongly suppressed the expression levels of Snail, which led to the suppression of growth and motility, respectively. Finally, we investigated whether DIF-1 exerts anticancer effects on TNBC in vivo. Intragastric administration of DIF-1 suppressed tumor growth and spontaneous lung metastasis of 4T1-Luc cells injected into the mammary fat pad of BALB/c mice. DIF-1 is expected to lead to the development of anticancer drugs, including anti-TNBC, by a novel mechanism.

34331012	Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains a major cause of cancer-related deaths primarily due to its inherent potential of therapy resistance. Checkpoint inhibitors have emerged as promising anti-cancer agents when used in combination with conventional anti-cancer therapies. Recent studies have highlighted a critical role of the Greatwall kinase (microtubule-associated serine/threonine-protein kinase-like (MASTL)) in promoting oncogenic malignancy and resistance to anti-cancer therapies; however, its role in PC remains unknown. Based on a comprehensive investigation involving PC patient samples, murine models of PC progression (Kras;PdxCre-KC and Kras;p53;PdxCre-KPC), and loss and gain of function studies, we report a previously undescribed critical role of MASTL in promoting cancer malignancy and therapy resistance. Mechanistically, MASTL promotes PC by modulating the epidermal growth factor receptor protein stability and, thereupon, kinase signaling. We further demonstrate that combinatorial therapy targeting MASTL promotes the efficacy of the cell-killing effects of Gemcitabine using both genetic and pharmacological inhibitions. Taken together, this study identifies a key role of MASTL in promoting PC progression and its utility as a novel target in promoting sensitivity to the anti-PC therapies.

34345016	Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is an aggressive bone and soft tissue tumor of children and young adults in which the principal driver is a fusion gene, EWSR1-FLI1. Although the essential role of EWSR1-FLI1 protein in the regulation of oncogenesis, survival, and tumor progression processes has been described in-depth, little is known about the regulation of chimeric fusion-gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that the active nuclear HDAC6 in EWS modulates the acetylation status of specificity protein 1 (SP1), consequently regulating the SP1/P300 activator complex binding to EWSR1 and EWSR1-FLI1 promoters. Selective inhibition of HDAC6 impairs binding of the activator complex SP1/P300, thereby inducing EWSR1-FLI1 downregulation and significantly reducing its oncogenic functions. In addition, sensitivity of EWS cell lines to HDAC6 inhibition is higher than other tumor or non-tumor cell lines. High expression of HDAC6 in primary EWS tumor samples from patients correlates with a poor prognosis in two independent series accounting 279 patients. Notably, a combination treatment of a selective HDAC6 and doxorubicin (a DNA damage agent used as a standard therapy of EWS patients) dramatically inhibits tumor growth in two EWS murine xenograft models. These results could lead to suitable and promising therapeutic alternatives for patients with EWS.

34471235	Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a key player in the Hippo pathway, has been shown to play a critical role in tumor progression. However, the role of YAP1 in prostate cancer cell invasion, migration, and metastasis is not well defined. Through functional, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic analyses, we showed that prolyl hydroxylation of YAP1 plays a critical role in the suppression of cell migration, invasion, and metastasis in prostate cancer. Knockdown (KD) or knockout (KO) of YAP1 led to an increase in cell migration, invasion, and metastasis in prostate cancer cells. Microarray analysis showed that the EMT pathway was activated in Yap1-KD cells. ChIP-seq analysis showed that YAP1 target genes are enriched in pathways regulating cell migration. Mass spectrometry analysis identified P4H prolyl hydroxylase in the YAP1 complex and YAP1 was hydroxylated at multiple proline residues. Proline-to-alanine mutations of YAP1 isoform 3 identified proline 174 as a critical residue, and its hydroxylation suppressed cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. KO of P4ha2 led to an increase in cell migration and invasion, which was reversed upon Yap1 KD. Our study identified a novel regulatory mechanism of YAP1 by which P4HA2-dependent prolyl hydroxylation of YAP1 determines its transcriptional activities and its function in prostate cancer metastasis.

34385595	N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) is a key regulator that interacts with many classic tumor signaling pathways, including some molecules downstream of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, whether NDRG1 is involved in the mechanism of resistance to cetuximab (CTX), the first monoclonal antibody targeting the EGFR has not been reported. Here, we found that NDRG1 enhanced the sensitivity of CTX in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines. Afterwards, we determined the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon. We demonstrated that NDRG1 inhibited the expression of EGFR; blocked EGFR phosphorylation and reduced the EGFR distribution in the cell membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus. And then, NDRG1 suppressed the EGFR downstream signaling: RAS/RAF/ERK and PI3k/AKT/mTOR pathways. Moreover, we discovered that NDRG1 attenuated the endocytosis and degradation of EGFR induced by caveolin-1 (Cav1). Additionally, our findings were further observed in an animal model and human tissues. Our results represent a potentially significant discovery that explains the mechanisms of NDRG1 in CTX resistance. NDRG1 could be a promising biomarker to predict optimum responses to CTX, and a key target to enhance CTX activity in the treatment of metastatic CRC (mCRC).

34489551	The leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 6 (LGR6) is considered to be a stem cell marker in many normal tissues and promotes tissue development, regeneration, and repair. LGR6 is also related to the initiation and progression of some malignant tumors. However, the role of LGR6 in cervical cancer has not been reported. Here, immunohistochemistry and western blotting showed that LGR6 was significantly upregulated in cervical cancer, compared with the normal cervix. By analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas database, LGR6 was found to be correlated with a poor prognosis of cervical cancer. Then, a small population of LGR6(high) cells isolated by using the fluorescence-activated cell sorting exhibited enhanced properties of cancer stem cells including self-renewal, differentiation, and tumorigenicity. Moreover, RNA sequencing revealed that LGR6 was correlated with the Wnt signaling pathway and TOP/FOP, reverse transcription-PCR, and western blotting further proved that LGR6 could activate the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Interestingly, LGR6 upregulated the expression of TCF7L2 by activating the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Then, TCF7L2 combining with beta-catenin in the nucleus enhanced LGR6 transcription by binding the promoter of LGR6, which further activated the Wnt signaling to form a positive feedback loop. Thus, our study demonstrated that LGR6 activated a novel beta-catenin/TCF7L2/LGR6-positive feedback loop in LGR6(high) cervical cancer stem cells (CSCs), which provided a new therapeutic strategy for targeting cervical CSCs to improve the prognosis of cervical cancer patients.

34545187	"Canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is an established regulator of cellular state and its critical contributions to tumor initiation, malignant tumor progression and metastasis formation have been demonstrated in various cancer types. Here, we investigated how the binding of beta-catenin to the transcriptional coactivators B-cell CLL/lymphoma 9 (Bcl9) and Bcl9-Like (Bcl9L) affected mammary gland carcinogenesis in the MMTV-PyMT transgenic mouse model of metastatic breast cancer. Conditional knockout of both Bcl9 and Bcl9L resulted into tumor cell death. In contrast, disrupting the interaction of Bcl9/Bcl9L with beta-catenin, either by deletion of their HD2 domains or by a point mutation in the N-terminal domain of beta-catenin (D164A), diminished primary tumor growth and tumor cell proliferation and reduced tumor cell invasion and lung metastasis. In comparison, the disruption of HD1 domain-mediated binding of Bcl9/Bcl9L to Pygopus had only moderate effects. Interestingly, interfering with the beta-catenin-Bcl9/Bcl9L-Pygo chain of adapters only partially impaired the transcriptional response of mammary tumor cells to Wnt3a and TGFbeta treatments. Together, the results indicate that Bcl9/Bcl9L modulate but are not critically required for canonical Wnt signaling in its contribution to breast cancer growth and malignant progression, a notion consistent with the ""just-right"" hypothesis of Wnt-driven tumor progression."

34535770	Liver metastasis (LM) severely affects gastric cancer (GC) patients' prognosis. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) play key roles in intercellular communication. Specific sEV-miRNAs from several types of cancer were found to induce a premetastatic niche in target organs before tumor cell arrive. However, whether the primary GC affects hepatic microenvironment or the role of sEV-miRNAs in GC-LM is yet unclear. We report that GC-derived sEVs are primarily absorbed by Kupffer cells (KCs). sEV-miR-151a-3p is highly expressed in GC-LM patients' plasma and presents poor prognosis. Treating mice with sEVs-enriched in miR-151a-3p promotes GC-LM, whereas has no influence on the proliferation of GC cells in situ. Mechanistically, sEV-miR-151a-3p inhibits SP3 in KCs. Simultaneously, sEV-miR-151a-3p targets YTHDF3 to decrease the transcriptional inhibitory activity of SP3 by reducing SUMO1 translation in a N6-methyladenosine-dependent manner. These factors contribute to TGF-beta1 transactivation in KCs, subsequently activating the SMAD2/3 pathway and enhancing the stem cell-like properties of incoming GC cells. Furthermore, sEV-miR-151a-3p induces miR-151a-3p transcription in KCs to form a positive feedback loop. In summary, our results reveal a previously unidentified regulatory axis initiated by sEV-miR-151a-3p that establishes a hepatic stemness-permissive niche to support GC-LM. sEV-miR-151a-3p could be a promising diagnostic biomarker and preventive treatment candidate for GC-LM.	miR-151a-3p-rich small extracellular vesicles derived from gastric cancer accelerate liver metastasis via initiating a hepatic stemness-enhancing niche.

32398349	Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that dictates whether cells survive or die in response to the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and other inflammatory stimuli. The activity of RIPK1 is tightly controlled by multiple posttranslational modification mechanisms, including ubiquitination and phosphorylation. Here, we report that sensitivity to TNF-induced, RIPK1-dependent cell death was tunable by the pH environment. We found that an acidic extracellular pH, which led to a concomitant decrease in intracellular pH, impaired the kinase activation of RIPK1 and autophosphorylation at Ser(166) Consequently, formation of the cytosolic death-inducing complex II and subsequent RIPK1-dependent necroptosis and apoptosis were inhibited. By contrast, low pH did not affect the formation of membrane-anchored TNFR1-containing signaling complex (complex I), RIPK1 ubiquitination, and NF-kappaB activation. TNF-induced cell death in Ripk1 (-/-) cells was not sensitive to pH changes. Furthermore, mutation of the conserved His(151) abolished the pH dependence of RIPK1 activation, suggesting that this histidine residue functions as a proton acceptor to modulate RIPK1 activity in response to pH changes. These results revealed an unexpected environmental factor that controls the death-inducing activity of RIPK1.	The death-inducing activity of RIPK1 is regulated by the pH environment.

32457113	Although insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling promotes tumor growth and cancer progression, therapies that target the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) have shown poor clinical efficacy. To address IGF-1R activity in cancer cells and how it differs from that of the closely related insulin receptor (IR), we focused on two tyrosines in the IGF-1R C-terminal tail that are not present in the IR and are essential for IGF-1-mediated cancer cell survival, migration, and tumorigenic growth. We found that Tyr(1250) and Tyr(1251) (Tyr(1250/1251)) were autophosphorylated in a cell adhesion-dependent manner. To investigate the consequences of this phosphorylation, we generated phosphomimetic Y1250E/Y1251E (EE) and nonphosphorylatable Y1250F/Y1251F (FF) mutant forms of IGF-1R. Although fully competent in kinase activity and signaling, the EE mutant was more rapidly internalized and degraded than either the wild-type or FF receptor. IGF-1 promoted the accumulation of wild-type and EE IGF-1R within the Golgi apparatus, whereas the FF mutant remained at the plasma membrane. Golgi-associated IGF-1R signaling was a feature of migratory cancer cells, and Golgi disruption impaired IGF-1-induced signaling and cell migration. Upon the formation of new cell adhesions, IGF-1R transiently relocalized to the plasma membrane from the Golgi. Thus, phosphorylation at Tyr(1250/1251) promoted IGF-1R translocation to and signaling from the Golgi to support an aggressive cancer phenotype. This process distinguishes IGF-1R from IR signaling and could contribute to the poor clinical efficacy of antibodies that target IGF-1R on the cell surface.

32576681	Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are often overexpressed or mutated in cancers and drive tumor growth and metastasis. In the current model of RTK signaling, including that of MET, downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) mediates both cell proliferation and cell migration, whereas the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rac1 mediates cell migration. However, in cultured NIH3T3 and glioblastoma cells, we found that class I PI3K mediated oncogenic MET-induced cell migration but not anchorage-independent growth. In contrast, Rac1 regulated both processes in distinct ways. Downstream of PI3K, Rac1 mediated cell migration through its GTPase activity, whereas independently of PI3K, Rac1 mediated anchorage-independent growth in a GTPase-independent manner through an adaptor function. Through its RKR motif, Rac1 formed a complex with the kinase mTOR to promote its translocation to the plasma membrane, where its activity promoted anchorage-independent growth of the cell cultures. Inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin suppressed the growth of subcutaneous MET-mutant cell grafts in mice, including that of MET inhibitor-resistant cells. These findings reveal a GTPase-independent role for Rac1 in mediating a PI3K-independent MET-to-mTOR pathway and suggest alternative or combined strategies that might overcome resistance to RTK inhibitors in patients with cancer.

32817372	Disruption of the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway results in the transactivation of NRF2 target genes, consequently inducing cell proliferation and other phenotypic changes in cancer cells. Here, we demonstrated that GULP1 was a KEAP1-binding protein that maintained actin cytoskeleton architecture and helped KEAP1 to sequester NRF2 in the cytoplasm. In urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB), silencing of GULP1 facilitated the nuclear accumulation of NRF2, led to constitutive activation of NRF2 signaling, and conferred resistance to the platinum drug cisplatin. Knockdown of GULP1 in UCB cells promoted tumor cell proliferation in vitro and enhanced tumor growth in vivo. In primary UCB, GULP1 silencing was more prevalent in muscle-invasive UCB compared to nonmuscle-invasive UCB. GULP1 knockdown cells showed resistance to cisplatin treatment. In parallel with decreased GULP1 expression, we observed increased expression of NRF2, HMOX1, and other candidate antioxidant genes in cisplatin-resistant cells. Furthermore, low or no expression of GULP1 was observed in most cisplatin nonresponder cases. Silencing of GULP1 was associated with GULP1 promoter hypermethylation in cell lines and primary tumors, and a high frequency of GULP1 promoter methylation was observed in multiple sets of primary clinical UCB samples. Together, our findings demonstrate that GULP1 is a KEAP1-binding protein that regulates KEAP1-NRF2 signaling in UCB and that promoter hypermethylation of GULP1 is a potential mechanism of GULP1 silencing.	GULP1 regulates the NRF2-KEAP1 signaling axis in urothelial carcinoma.	Science signaling	1
32873726	C3G is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that regulates cell adhesion and migration by activating the GTPase Rap1. The GEF activity of C3G is stimulated by the adaptor proteins Crk and CrkL and by tyrosine phosphorylation. Here, we uncovered mechanisms of C3G autoinhibition and activation. Specifically, we found that two intramolecular interactions regulate the activity of C3G. First, an autoinhibitory region (AIR) within the central domain of C3G binds to and blocks the catalytic Cdc25H domain. Second, the binding of the protein's N-terminal domain to its Ras exchanger motif (REM) is required for its GEF activity. CrkL activated C3G by displacing the AIR/Cdc25HD interaction. Two missense mutations in the AIR found in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, Y554H and M555K, disrupted the autoinhibitory mechanism. Expression of C3G-Y554H or C3G-M555K in Ba/F3 pro-B cells caused constitutive activation of Rap1 and, consequently, the integrin LFA-1. Our findings suggest that sustained Rap1 activation by deregulated C3G might promote progression of lymphomas and that designing therapeutics to target C3G might treat these malignancies.

33051258	Small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) of the RAS superfamily signal by directly binding to multiple downstream effector proteins. Effectors are defined by a folded RAS-association (RA) domain that binds exclusively to GTP-loaded (activated) RAS, but the binding specificities of most RA domains toward more than 160 RAS superfamily GTPases have not been characterized. Ten RA domain family (RASSF) proteins comprise the largest group of related effectors and are proposed to couple RAS to the proapoptotic Hippo pathway. Here, we showed that RASSF1-6 formed complexes with the Hippo kinase ortholog MST1, whereas RASSF7-10 formed oligomers with the p53-regulating effectors ASPP1 and ASPP2. Moreover, only RASSF5 bound directly to activated HRAS and KRAS, and RASSFs did not augment apoptotic induction downstream of RAS oncoproteins. Structural modeling revealed that expansion of the RASSF effector family in vertebrates included amino acid substitutions to key residues that direct GTPase-binding specificity. We demonstrated that the tumor suppressor RASSF1A formed complexes with the RAS-related GTPases GEM, REM1, REM2, and the enigmatic RASL12. Furthermore, interactions between RASSFs and RAS GTPases blocked YAP1 nuclear localization. Thus, these simple scaffolds link the activation of diverse RAS family small G proteins to Hippo or p53 regulation.	RASSF effectors couple diverse RAS subfamily GTPases to the Hippo pathway.

33563698	Trypanosoma brucei, an important human parasite, has a flagellum that controls cell motility, morphogenesis, proliferation, and cell-cell communication. Inheritance of the newly assembled flagellum during the cell cycle requires the Polo-like kinase homolog TbPLK and the kinetoplastid-specific protein phosphatase KPP1, although whether TbPLK acts on KPP1 or vice versa has been unclear. Here, we showed that dephosphorylation of TbPLK on Thr(125) by KPP1 maintained low TbPLK activity in the flagellum-associated hook complex structure, thereby ensuring proper flagellum positioning and attachment. This dephosphorylation event required the recognition of phosphorylated Thr(198) in the activation loop of TbPLK by the N-terminal Plus3 domain of KPP1 and the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated Thr(125) in TbPLK by the C-terminal catalytic domain of KPP1. Dephosphorylation of TbPLK by KPP1 prevented hyperphosphorylation of the hook complex protein TbCentrin2, thereby allowing timely dephosphorylation of phosphorylated TbCentrin2 for hook complex duplication and flagellum positioning and attachment. Thus, KPP1 attenuates TbPLK activity by dephosphorylating TbPLK to facilitate flagellum inheritance.

33824181	The myeloperoxidase (MPO) system of myeloid-derived cells (MDCs) is central to cellular innate immunity. Upon MDC activation, MPO is secreted into phagosomes where it catalyzes the production of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a potent chlorinating oxidant. Here, we demonstrated that the myeloid lineage-restricted MPO-HOCl system had antitumor effects in early melanoma growth in aged mice. Orthotopic melanomas grew more slowly in immunocompetent MPO(+/+) host mice compared to age-matched syngeneic MPO(-/-) mice. Real-time intravital tumor imaging in vivo and in cell cocultures revealed a cell-cell proximity-dependent association between MDC-derived MPO enzyme activity and blockade of ligand-induced IkappaBalpha degradation in tumor cells. HOCl directly trans-inhibited IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity in tumor cells, thereby decreasing nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcriptional activation and inducing changes in the expression of genes involved in metabolic pathways, cell cycle progression, and DNA replication. By contrast, HOCl induced transcriptional changes in CD8(+) T cells related to ion transport and the MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways that are associated with T cell activation. MPO increased the circulating concentrations of the myeloid cell-attracting cytokines CXCL1 and CXCL5, enhanced local infiltration by CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells, and decreased tumor growth. Overall, these data reveal a role for MDC-derived HOCl as a small-molecule paracrine signaling factor that trans-inhibits IKK in melanoma tumor cells, mediating antitumor responses during early tumor progression.	Myeloid cell-derived HOCl is a paracrine effector that trans-inhibits IKK/NF-kappaB in melanoma cells and limits early tumor progression.	Science signaling	1
33879602	Chloride intracellular channels 1 (CLIC1) and 4 (CLIC4) are expressed in endothelial cells and regulate angiogenic behaviors in vitro, and the expression of Clic4 is important for vascular development and function in mice. Here, we found that CLIC1 and CLIC4 in endothelial cells regulate critical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways associated with vascular development and disease. In cultured endothelial cells, we found that CLIC1 and CLIC4 transiently translocated to the plasma membrane in response to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). Both CLIC1 and CLIC4 were essential for mediating S1P-induced activation of the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rac1 downstream of S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1). In contrast, only CLIC1 was essential for S1P-induced activation of the small GTPase RhoA downstream of S1PR2 and S1PR3. Neither were required for other S1P-S1PR signaling outputs. Rescue experiments revealed that CLIC1 and CLIC4 were not functionally interchangeable, suggesting distinct and specific functions for CLICs in transducing GPCR signaling. These CLIC-mediated mechanisms were critical for S1P-induced stimulation of the barrier function in endothelial cell monolayers. Our results define CLICs as previously unknown players in the pathways linking GPCRs to small GTPases and vascular endothelial function.

33947796	The dual-specificity phosphatase PTEN functions as a tumor suppressor by hydrolyzing PI(3,4,5)P3 to PI(4,5)P2 to inhibit PI3K-AKT signaling and cellular proliferation. P-Rex2 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho GTPases and can be activated by Gbetagamma subunits downstream of G protein-coupled receptor signaling and by PI(3,4,5)P3 downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases. The PTEN:P-Rex2 complex is a commonly mutated signaling node in metastatic cancer. Assembly of the PTEN:P-Rex2 complex inhibits the activity of both proteins, and its dysregulation can drive PI3K-AKT signaling and cellular proliferation. Here, using cross-linking mass spectrometry and functional studies, we gained mechanistic insights into PTEN:P-Rex2 complex assembly and coinhibition. We found that PTEN was anchored to P-Rex2 by interactions between the PDZ-interacting motif in the PTEN C-terminal tail and the second PDZ domain of P-Rex2. This interaction bridged PTEN across the P-Rex2 surface, preventing PI(3,4,5)P3 hydrolysis. Conversely, PTEN both allosterically promoted an autoinhibited conformation of P-Rex2 and blocked its binding to Gbetagamma. In addition, we observed that the PTEN-deactivating mutations and P-Rex2 truncations combined to drive Rac1 activation to a greater extent than did either single variant alone. These insights enabled us to propose a class of gain-of-function, cancer-associated mutations within the PTEN:P-Rex2 interface that uncouple PTEN from the inhibition of Rac1 signaling.	Structural analysis of the PTEN:P-Rex2 signaling complex reveals how cancer-associated mutations coordinate to hyperactivate Rac1.	Science signaling	0
34006608	Developing hippocampal neurons undergo rapid synaptogenesis in response to neurotrophic signals to form and refine circuit connections. The adipokine leptin is a satiety factor with neurotrophic actions, which potentiates both glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptogenesis in the hippocampus during neonatal development. Brief exposure to leptin enhances GABAA receptor-dependent synaptic currents in hippocampal neurons. Here, using molecular and electrophysiological techniques, we found that leptin increased the surface localization of GABAA receptors and the number of functional GABAergic synapses in hippocampal cultures from male and female rat pups. Leptin increased the interaction between GABAA receptors and the Rho guanine exchange factor beta-PIX (a scaffolding protein at GABAergic postsynaptic sites) in a manner dependent on the kinase CaMKK. We also found that the leptin receptor and beta-PIX formed a complex, the amount of which transiently increased upon leptin receptor activation. Furthermore, Tyr(985) in the leptin receptor and the SH3 domain of beta-PIX are crucial for this interaction, which was required for the developmental increase in GABAergic synaptogenesis. Our results suggest a mechanism by which leptin promotes GABAergic synaptogenesis in hippocampal neurons and reveal further complexity in leptin receptor signaling and its interactome.

34285131	Murine gammadelta(17) cells, which are T cells that bear the gammadelta T cell receptor (TCRgammadelta) and secrete interleukin-17A (IL-17A), are generated in the thymus and are critical for various immune responses. Although strong TCRgammadelta signals are required for the development of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-secreting gammadelta cells (gammadelta(IFN) cells), the generation of gammadelta(17) cells requires weaker TCRgammadelta signaling. Here, we demonstrated that constrained activation of the kinase Syk downstream of TCRgammadelta was required for the thymic development of gammadelta(17) cells. Increasing or decreasing Syk activity by stimulating TCRgammadelta or inhibiting Syk, respectively, substantially reduced gammadelta(17) cell numbers. This delimited Syk activity optimally engaged the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway, which maintained the expression of master regulators of the IL-17 program, RORgammat and c-Maf. Inhibition of PI3K not only abrogated gammadelta(17) cell development but also augmented the development of a distinct, previously undescribed subset of gammadelta T cells. These CD8(+)Ly6a(+) gammadelta T cells had a type-I IFN gene expression signature and expanded in response to stimulation with IFN-beta. Collectively, these studies elucidate how weaker TCRgammadelta signaling engages distinct signaling pathways to specify the gammadelta(17) cell fate and identifies a role for type-I IFNs in gammadelta T cell development.	Constrained TCRgammadelta-associated Syk activity engages PI3K to facilitate thymic development of IL-17A-secreting gammadelta T cells.	Science signaling	1
34315807	Mutations in the kinase LRRK2 and impaired endocytic trafficking are both implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Expression of the PD-associated LRRK2 mutant in mouse dopaminergic neurons was shown to disrupt clathrin-mediated endocytic trafficking. Here, we explored the molecular mechanism linking LRRK2 to endocytosis and found that LRRK2 bound to and phosphorylated the mu2 subunit of the adaptor protein AP2 (AP2M1), a core component of the clathrin-mediated endocytic machinery. Analysis of human SH-SY5Y cells and mouse neurons and tissues revealed that loss of LRRK2 abundance or kinase function resulted in decreased phosphorylation of AP2M1, which is required for the initial formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). In contrast, overexpression of LRRK2 or expression of a Parkinson's disease-associated gain-of-function mutant LRRK2 (G2019S) inhibited the uncoating of AP2M1 from CCVs at later stages and prevented new cycles of CCV formation. Thus, the abundance and activity of LRRK2 must be calibrated to ensure proper endocytosis. Dysregulated phosphorylation of AP2M1 from the brain but not thyroid tissues of LRRK2 knockout and G2019S-knockin mice suggests a tissue-specific regulatory mechanism of endocytosis. Furthermore, we found that LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of AP2M1 mediated dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of PD. Together, our findings provide a mechanistic link between LRRK2, AP2, and endocytosis in the pathogenesis of PD.	Dysregulation of the AP2M1 phosphorylation cycle by LRRK2 impairs endocytosis and leads to dopaminergic neurodegeneration.	Science signaling	0
34404752	The pleiotropic chemokine CXCL12 is involved in diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes, including embryogenesis, hematopoiesis, leukocyte migration, and tumor metastasis. It is known to engage the classical receptor CXCR4 and the atypical receptor ACKR3. Differential receptor engagement can transduce distinct cellular signals and effects as well as alter the amount of free, extracellular chemokine. CXCR4 binds both monomeric and the more commonly found dimeric forms of CXCL12, whereas ACKR3 binds monomeric forms. Here, we found that CXCL12 also bound to the atypical receptor ACKR1 (previously known as Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines or DARC). In vitro nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that dimeric CXCL12 bound to the extracellular N terminus of ACKR1 with low nanomolar affinity, whereas the binding affinity of monomeric CXCL12 was orders of magnitude lower. In transfected MDCK cells and primary human Duffy-positive erythrocytes, a dimeric, but not a monomeric, construct of CXCL12 efficiently bound to and internalized with ACKR1. This interaction between CXCL12 and ACKR1 provides another layer of regulation of the multiple biological functions of CXCL12. The findings also raise the possibility that ACKR1 can bind other dimeric chemokines, thus potentially further expanding the role of ACKR1 in chemokine retention and presentation.	The dimeric form of CXCL12 binds to atypical chemokine receptor 1.	Science signaling	1

32351028	Neuronal activity is responsible for the high energy consumption in the brain. However, the cellular mechanisms draining ATP upon the arrival of a stimulus are yet to be explored systematically at the post-synapse. Here, we provide evidence that a significant fraction of ATP is consumed upon glutamate stimulation to energize mGluR-induced protein synthesis. We find that both mGluR and NMDAR alter protein synthesis and ATP consumption with distinct kinetics at the synaptic-dendritic compartments. While mGluR activation leads to a rapid and sustained reduction in neuronal ATP levels, NMDAR activation has no immediate impact on the same. ATP consumption correlates inversely with the kinetics of protein synthesis for both receptors. We observe a persistent elevation in protein synthesis within 5 minutes of mGluR activation and a robust inhibition of the same within 2 minutes of NMDAR activation, assessed by the phosphorylation status of eEF2 and metabolic labeling. However, a delayed protein synthesis-dependent ATP expenditure ensues after 15 minutes of NMDAR stimulation. We identify a central role for AMPK in the correlation between protein synthesis and ATP consumption. AMPK is dephosphorylated and inhibited upon mGluR activation, while it is phosphorylated upon NMDAR activation. Perturbing AMPK activity disrupts receptor-specific modulations of eEF2 phosphorylation and protein synthesis. Our observations, therefore, demonstrate that the regulation of the AMPK-eEF2 signaling axis by glutamate receptors alters neuronal protein synthesis and bioenergetics.

32270908	Centrosome amplification is a hallmark of cancer, and centrosome clustering is essential for cancer cell survival. The mitotic kinesin HSET is an essential contributor to this process. Recent studies have highlighted novel functions for intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins in regulating motors and mitotic processes. Here, using siRNA knock-down of various IFT proteins or AID-inducible degradation of endogenous IFT88 in combination with small-molecule inhibition of HSET, we show that IFT proteins together with HSET are required for efficient centrosome clustering. We identify a direct interaction between the kinesin HSET and IFT proteins, and we define how IFT proteins contribute to clustering dynamics during mitosis using high-resolution live imaging of centrosomes. Finally, we demonstrate the requirement of IFT88 for efficient centrosome clustering in a variety of cancer cell lines naturally harboring supernumerary centrosomes and its importance for cancer cell proliferation. Overall, our data unravel a novel role for the IFT machinery in centrosome clustering during mitosis in cells harboring supernumerary centrosomes.

32484313	Nuclear accessibility of transcription factors controls gene expression, co-regulated by Ran-dependent nuclear localization and a competitive regulatory network. Here, we reveal that nuclear import factor-facilitated transcriptional repression attenuates ribosome biogenesis under chronic salt stress. Kap114p, one of the karyopherin-betas (Kap-betas) that mediates nuclear import of yeast TATA-binding protein (yTBP), exhibits a yTBP-binding affinity four orders of magnitude greater than its counterparts and suppresses binding of yTBP with DNA. Our crystal structure of Kap114p reveals an extensively negatively charged concave surface, accounting for high-affinity basic-protein binding. KAP114 knockout in yeast leads to a high-salt growth defect, with transcriptomic analyses revealing that Kap114p modulates expression of genes associated with ribosomal biogenesis by suppressing yTBP binding to target promoters, a trans-repression mechanism we attribute to reduced nuclear Ran levels under salinity stress. Our findings reveal that Ran integrates the nuclear transport pathway and transcription regulatory network, allowing yeast to respond to environmental stresses.	Karyopherin Kap114p-mediated trans-repression controls ribosomal gene expression under saline stress.	EMBO reports	1
32510763	Recently, de novo mutations of transcription factor 20 (TCF20) were found in patients with autism by large-scale exome sequencing. However, how TCF20 modulates brain development and whether its dysfunction causes ASD remain unclear. Here, we show that TCF20 deficits impair neurogenesis in mouse. TCF20 deletion significantly reduces the number of neurons, which leads to abnormal brain functions. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis and ChIP-qPCR reveal that the DNA demethylation factor TDG is a downstream target gene of TCF20. As a nonspecific DNA demethylation factor, TDG potentially affects many genes. Combined TDG ChIP-seq and GO analysis of TCF20 RNA-Seq identifies T-cell factor 4 (TCF-4) as a common target. TDG controls the DNA methylation level in the promoter area of TCF-4, affecting TCF-4 expression and modulating neural differentiation. Overexpression of TDG or TCF-4 rescues the deficient neurogenesis of TCF20 knockdown brains. Together, our data reveal that TCF20 is essential for neurogenesis and we suggest that defects in neurogenesis caused by TCF20 loss are associated with ASD.	TCF20 dysfunction leads to cortical neurogenesis defects and autistic-like behaviors in mice.	EMBO reports	0
32783398	IkappaB kinase epsilon (IKKepsilon) is a key molecule at the crossroads of inflammation and cancer. Known to regulate cytokine secretion via NFkappaB and IRF3, the kinase is also a breast cancer oncogene, overexpressed in a variety of tumours. However, to what extent IKKepsilon remodels cellular metabolism is currently unknown. Here, we used metabolic tracer analysis to show that IKKepsilon orchestrates a complex metabolic reprogramming that affects mitochondrial metabolism and consequently serine biosynthesis independently of its canonical signalling role. We found that IKKepsilon upregulates the serine biosynthesis pathway (SBP) indirectly, by limiting glucose-derived pyruvate utilisation in the TCA cycle, inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation. Inhibition of mitochondrial function induces activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which in turn drives upregulation of the expression of SBP genes. Importantly, pharmacological reversal of the IKKepsilon-induced metabolic phenotype reduces proliferation of breast cancer cells. Finally, we show that in a highly proliferative set of ER negative, basal breast tumours, IKKepsilon and PSAT1 are both overexpressed, corroborating the link between IKKepsilon and the SBP in the clinical context.	The breast cancer oncogene IKKepsilon coordinates mitochondrial function and serine metabolism.	EMBO reports	0
33026181	"Visual cortical circuits show profound plasticity during early life and are later stabilized by molecular ""brakes"" limiting excessive rewiring beyond a critical period. The mechanisms coordinating the expression of these factors during the transition from development to adulthood remain unknown. We found that miR-29a expression in the visual cortex dramatically increases with age, but it is not experience-dependent. Precocious high levels of miR-29a blocked ocular dominance plasticity and caused an early appearance of perineuronal nets. Conversely, inhibition of miR-29a in adult mice using LNA antagomirs activated ocular dominance plasticity, reduced perineuronal nets, and restored their juvenile chemical composition. Activated adult plasticity had the typical functional and proteomic signature of critical period plasticity. Transcriptomic and proteomic studies indicated that miR-29a manipulation regulates the expression of plasticity brakes in specific cortical circuits. These data indicate that miR-29a is a regulator of the plasticity brakes promoting age-dependent stabilization of visual cortical connections."

33006225	Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) facilitates DNA damage response (DDR). While the Ewing's sarcoma breakpoint region 1 (EWS) protein fused to FLI1 triggers sarcoma formation, the physiological function of EWS is largely unknown. Here, we investigate the physiological role of EWS in regulating PARP1. We show that EWS is required for PARP1 dissociation from damaged DNA. Abnormal PARP1 accumulation caused by EWS inactivation leads to excessive Poly(ADP-Ribosy)lation (PARylation) and triggers cell death in both in vitro and in vivo models. Consistent with previous work, the arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) domain of EWS is essential for PAR chain interaction and PARP1 dissociation from damaged DNA. Ews and Parp1 double mutant mice do not show improved survival, but supplementation with nicotinamide mononucleotides extends Ews-mutant pups' survival, which might be due to compensatory activation of other PARP proteins. Consistently, PARP1 accumulates on chromatin in Ewing's sarcoma cells expressing an EWS fusion protein that cannot interact with PARP1, and tissues derived from Ewing's sarcoma patients show increased PARylation. Taken together, our data reveal that EWS is important for removing PARP1 from damaged chromatin.	Ewing sarcoma protein promotes dissociation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 from chromatin.

32924251	The latent HIV-1 reservoir is a major barrier to viral eradication. However, our understanding of how HIV-1 establishes latency is incomplete. Here, by performing a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout library screen, we identify phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1), also known as Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP), as a novel gene inducing HIV latency. Depletion of PEBP1 leads to the reactivation of HIV-1 in multiple models of latency. Mechanistically, PEBP1 de-phosphorylates Raf1/ERK/IkappaB and IKK/IkappaB signaling pathways to sequestrate NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm, which transcriptionally inactivates HIV-1 to induce latency. Importantly, the induction of PEBP1 expression by the green tea compound epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) prevents latency reversal by inhibiting nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, thereby suppressing HIV-1 transcription in primary CD4(+) T cells isolated from patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). These results suggest a critical role for PEBP1 in the regulation of upstream NF-kappaB signaling pathways governing HIV transcription. Targeting of this pathway could be an option to control HIV reservoirs in patients in the future.	PEBP1 suppresses HIV transcription and induces latency by inactivating MAPK/NF-kappaB signaling.

33274589	Autophagy mediates the degradation of cytoplasmic material. Upon autophagy induction, autophagosomes form a sealed membrane around the cargo and fuse with the lytic compartment to release the cargo for degradation. In order to avoid premature fusion of immature autophagosomal membranes with the lytic compartment, this process needs to be tightly regulated. Several factors mediating autophagosome-vacuole fusion have recently been identified. In budding yeast, autophagosome-vacuole fusion requires the R-SNARE Ykt6 on the autophagosome, together with the three Q-SNAREs Vam3, Vam7, and Vti1 on the vacuole. However, how these SNAREs are regulated during the fusion process is poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the regulation of Ykt6. We found that Ykt6 is directly phosphorylated by Atg1 kinase, which keeps this SNARE in an inactive state. Ykt6 phosphorylation prevents SNARE bundling by disrupting its interaction with the vacuolar SNAREs Vam3 and Vti1, thereby preventing premature autophagosome-vacuole fusion. These findings shed new light on the regulation of autophagosome-vacuole fusion and reveal a further step in autophagy controlled by the Atg1 kinase.	Atg1 kinase regulates autophagosome-vacuole fusion by controlling SNARE bundling.	EMBO reports	0
33063451	Tumor cells subvert immune surveillance by harnessing signals from immune checkpoints to acquire immune resistance. The protein PD-L1 is an important component in this process, and inhibition of PD-L1 elicits durable anti-tumor responses in a broad spectrum of cancers. However, immune checkpoint inhibition that target known pathways is not universally effective. A better understanding of the genetic repertoire underlying these processes is necessary to expand our knowledge in tumor immunity and to facilitate identification of alternative targets. Here, we present a CRISPR/Cas9 screen in human cancer cells to identify genes that confer tumors with the ability to evade the cytotoxic effects of the immune system. We show that the transcriptional regulator MLLT6 (AF17) is required for efficient PD-L1 protein expression and cell surface presentation in cancer cells. MLLT6 depletion alleviates suppression of CD8(+) cytotoxic T cell-mediated cytolysis. Furthermore, cancer cells lacking MLLT6 exhibit impaired STAT1 signaling and are insensitive to interferon-gamma-induced stimulation of IDO1, GBP5, CD74, and MHC class II genes. Collectively, our findings establish MLLT6 as a regulator of oncogenic and interferon-gamma-associated immune resistance.	MLLT6 maintains PD-L1 expression and mediates tumor immune resistance.

33047485	The function and maintenance of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are tightly regulated by signals originating from their niche environment. Skeletal myofibers are a principle component of the MuSC niche and are in direct contact with the muscle stem cells. Here, we show that Myf6 establishes a ligand/receptor interaction between muscle stem cells and their associated muscle fibers. Our data show that Myf6 transcriptionally regulates a broad spectrum of myokines and muscle-secreted proteins in skeletal myofibers, including EGF. EGFR signaling blocks p38 MAP kinase-induced differentiation of muscle stem cells. Homozygous deletion of Myf6 causes a significant reduction in the ability of muscle to produce EGF, leading to a deregulation in EGFR signaling. Consequently, although Myf6-knockout mice are born with a normal muscle stem cell compartment, they undergo a progressive reduction in their stem cell pool during postnatal life due to spontaneous exit from quiescence. Taken together, our data uncover a novel role for Myf6 in promoting the expression of key myokines, such as EGF, in the muscle fiber which prevents muscle stem cell exhaustion by blocking their premature differentiation.	Myf6/MRF4 is a myogenic niche regulator required for the maintenance of the muscle stem cell pool.	EMBO reports	1
33314701	Many cancer cells maintain enhanced aerobic glycolysis due to irreversible defective mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). This phenomenon, known as the Warburg effect, is recently challenged because most cancer cells maintain OXPHOS. However, how cancer cells coordinate glycolysis and OXPHOS remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that OMA1, a stress-activated mitochondrial protease, promotes colorectal cancer development by driving metabolic reprogramming. OMA1 knockout suppresses colorectal cancer development in AOM/DSS and xenograft mice models of colorectal cancer. OMA1-OPA1 axis is activated by hypoxia, increasing mitochondrial ROS to stabilize HIF-1alpha, thereby promoting glycolysis in colorectal cancer cells. On the other hand, under hypoxia, OMA1 depletion promotes accumulation of NDUFB5, NDUFB6, NDUFA4, and COX4L1, supporting that OMA1 suppresses OXPHOS in colorectal cancer. Therefore, our findings support a role for OMA1 in coordination of glycolysis and OXPHOS to promote colorectal cancer development and highlight OMA1 as a potential target for colorectal cancer therapy.

33251722	AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a multifunctional kinase that regulates microtubule (MT) dynamic instability through CLIP-170 phosphorylation; however, its physiological relevance in vivo remains to be elucidated. In this study, we identified an active form of AMPK localized at the intercalated disks in the heart, a specific cell-cell junction present between cardiomyocytes. A contractile inhibitor, MYK-461, prevented the localization of AMPK at the intercalated disks, and the effect was reversed by the removal of MYK-461, suggesting that the localization of AMPK is regulated by mechanical stress. Time-lapse imaging analysis revealed that the inhibition of CLIP-170 Ser-311 phosphorylation by AMPK leads to the accumulation of MTs at the intercalated disks. Interestingly, MYK-461 increased the individual cell area of cardiomyocytes in CLIP-170 phosphorylation-dependent manner. Moreover, heart-specific CLIP-170 S311A transgenic mice demonstrated elongation of cardiomyocytes along with accumulated MTs, leading to progressive decline in cardiac contraction. In conclusion, these findings suggest that AMPK regulates the cell shape and aspect ratio of cardiomyocytes by modulating the turnover of MTs through homeostatic phosphorylation of CLIP-170 at the intercalated disks.	AMPK regulates cell shape of cardiomyocytes by modulating turnover of microtubules through CLIP-170.	EMBO reports	0
33410264	Sleep homeostasis is crucial for sleep regulation. The role of epigenetic regulation in sleep homeostasis is unestablished. Previous studies showed that octopamine is important for sleep homeostasis. However, the regulatory mechanism of octopamine reception in sleep is unknown. In this study, we identify an epigenetic regulatory cascade (Stuxnet-Polycomb-Octbeta2R) that modulates the octopamine receptor in Drosophila. We demonstrate that stuxnet positively regulates Octbeta2R through repression of Polycomb in the ellipsoid body of the adult fly brain and that Octbeta2R is one of the major receptors mediating octopamine function in sleep homeostasis. In response to octopamine, Octbeta2R transcription is inhibited as a result of stuxnet downregulation. This feedback through the Stuxnet-Polycomb-Octbeta2R cascade is crucial for sleep homeostasis regulation. This study demonstrates a Stuxnet-Polycomb-Octbeta2R-mediated epigenetic regulatory mechanism for octopamine reception, thus providing an example of epigenetic regulation of sleep homeostasis.	Epigenetic regulator Stuxnet modulates octopamine effect on sleep through a Stuxnet-Polycomb-Octbeta2R cascade.	EMBO reports	1
33403789	Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the most common subtype of esophageal cancer worldwide. The most commonly mutated gene in ESCC is TP53. Using a combinatorial genetic and carcinogenic approach, we generate a novel mouse model of ESCC expressing either mutant or null p53 and show that mutant p53 exhibits enhanced tumorigenic properties and displays a distinct genomic profile. Through RNA-seq analysis, we identify several endocytic recycling genes, including Rab Coupling Protein (Rab11-FIP1), which are significantly downregulated in mutant p53 tumor cells. In 3-dimensional (3D) organoid models, genetic knockdown of Rab11-FIP1 results in increased organoid size. Loss of Rab11-FIP1 increases tumor cell invasion in part through mutant p53 but also in an independent manner. Furthermore, loss of Rab11-FIP1 in human ESCC cell lines decreases E-cadherin expression and increases mesenchymal lineage-specific markers, suggesting induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Rab11-FIP1 regulates EMT through direct inhibition of Zeb1, a key EMT transcriptional factor. Our novel findings reveal that Rab11-FIP1 regulates organoid formation, tumor cell invasion, and EMT.	Rab11-FIP1 mediates epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasion in esophageal cancer.	EMBO reports	0
33369848	Cell signalling governs cellular behaviour and is therefore subject to tight spatiotemporal regulation. Signalling output is modulated by specialized cell membranes and vesicles which contain unique combinations of lipids and proteins. The phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2 ), an important component of the plasma membrane as well as other subcellular membranes, is involved in multiple processes, including signalling. However, which enzymes control the turnover of non-plasma membrane PI(4,5)P2 , and their impact on cell signalling and function at the organismal level are unknown. Here, we identify Paladin as a vascular PI(4,5)P2 phosphatase regulating VEGFR2 endosomal signalling and angiogenesis. Paladin is localized to endosomal and Golgi compartments and interacts with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in vitro and in vivo. Loss of Paladin results in increased internalization of VEGFR2, over-activation of extracellular regulated kinase 1/2, and hypersprouting of endothelial cells in the developing retina of mice. These findings suggest that inhibition of Paladin, or other endosomal PI(4,5)P2 phosphatases, could be exploited to modulate VEGFR2 signalling and angiogenesis, when direct and full inhibition of the receptor is undesirable.	Paladin is a phosphoinositide phosphatase regulating endosomal VEGFR2 signalling and angiogenesis.	EMBO reports	0
33590678	The eukaryotic replisome is disassembled in each cell cycle, dependent upon ubiquitylation of the CMG helicase. Studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans and Xenopus laevis have revealed surprising evolutionary diversity in the ubiquitin ligases that control CMG ubiquitylation, but regulated disassembly of the mammalian replisome has yet to be explored. Here, we describe a model system for studying the ubiquitylation and chromatin extraction of the mammalian CMG replisome, based on mouse embryonic stem cells. We show that the ubiquitin ligase CUL2(LRR1) is required for ubiquitylation of the CMG-MCM7 subunit during S-phase, leading to disassembly by the p97 ATPase. Moreover, a second pathway of CMG disassembly is activated during mitosis, dependent upon the TRAIP ubiquitin ligase that is mutated in primordial dwarfism and mis-regulated in various cancers. These findings indicate that replisome disassembly in diverse metazoa is regulated by a conserved pair of ubiquitin ligases, distinct from those present in other eukaryotes.

33565245	Parkin promotes cell survival by removing damaged mitochondria via mitophagy. However, although some studies have suggested that Parkin induces cell death, the regulatory mechanism underlying the dual role of Parkin remains unknown. Herein, we report that mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase (MITOL/MARCH5) regulates Parkin-mediated cell death through the FKBP38-dependent dynamic translocation from the mitochondria to the ER during mitophagy. Mechanistically, MITOL mediates ubiquitination of Parkin at lysine 220 residue, which promotes its proteasomal degradation, and thereby fine-tunes mitophagy by controlling the quantity of Parkin. Deletion of MITOL leads to accumulation of the phosphorylated active form of Parkin in the ER, resulting in FKBP38 degradation and enhanced cell death. Thus, we have shown that MITOL blocks Parkin-induced cell death, at least partially, by protecting FKBP38 from Parkin. Our findings unveil the regulation of the dual function of Parkin and provide a novel perspective on the pathogenesis of PD.	MITOL promotes cell survival by degrading Parkin during mitophagy.

33880847	Obesity has become a major health problem that has rapidly prevailed over the past several decades worldwide. Curcumin, a natural polyphenolic compound present in turmeric, has been shown to have a protective effect on against obesity and metabolic diseases. However, its underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the administration of curcumin significantly prevents HFD-induced obesity and decreases the fat mass of the subcutaneous inguinal WAT (iWAT) and visceral epididymal WAT (eWAT) in mice. Mechanistically, curcumin inhibits adipogenesis by reducing the expression of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKHB5), an m(6) A demethylase, which leads to higher m(6) A-modified TNF receptor-associated factor 4 (TRAF4) mRNA. TRAF4 mRNA with higher m(6) A level is recognized and bound by YTHDF1, leading to enhanced translation of TRAF4. TRAF4, acting as an E3 RING ubiquitin ligase, promotes degradation of adipocyte differentiation regulator PPARgamma by a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway thereby inhibiting adipogenesis. Thus, m(6) A-dependent TRAF4 expression upregulation by ALKBH5 and YTHDF1 contributes to curcumin-induced obesity prevention. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how m(6) A is involved in the anti-obesity effect of curcumin.	Curcumin prevents obesity by targeting TRAF4-induced ubiquitylation in m(6) A-dependent manner.	EMBO reports	0
33764618	Tyrosine phosphorylation of secretion machinery proteins is a crucial regulatory mechanism for exocytosis. However, the participation of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in different exocytosis stages has not been defined. Here we demonstrate that PTP-MEG2 controls multiple steps of catecholamine secretion. Biochemical and crystallographic analyses reveal key residues that govern the interaction between PTP-MEG2 and its substrate, a peptide containing the phosphorylated NSF-pY(83) site, specify PTP-MEG2 substrate selectivity, and modulate the fusion of catecholamine-containing vesicles. Unexpectedly, delineation of PTP-MEG2 mutants along with the NSF binding interface reveals that PTP-MEG2 controls the fusion pore opening through NSF independent mechanisms. Utilizing bioinformatics search and biochemical and electrochemical screening approaches, we uncover that PTP-MEG2 regulates the opening and extension of the fusion pore by dephosphorylating the DYNAMIN2-pY(125) and MUNC18-1-pY(145) sites. Further structural and biochemical analyses confirmed the interaction of PTP-MEG2 with MUNC18-1-pY(145) or DYNAMIN2-pY(125) through a distinct structural basis compared with that of the NSF-pY(83) site. Our studies thus provide mechanistic insights in complex exocytosis processes.	PTP-MEG2 regulates quantal size and fusion pore opening through two distinct structural bases and substrates.

33749979	SIRT7 is a NAD(+) -dependent deacetylase that controls important aspects of metabolism, cancer, and bone formation. However, the molecular targets and functions of SIRT7 in the kidney are currently unknown. In silico analysis of kidney transcripts of the BXD murine genetic reference population revealed a positive correlation between Sirt7 and Slc12a7 mRNA expression, suggesting a link between the corresponding proteins that these transcripts encode, SIRT7, and the K-Cl cotransporter KCC4, respectively. Here, we find that protein levels and activity of heterologously expressed KCC4 are significantly modulated depending on its acetylation status in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Moreover, SIRT7 interacts with KCC4 in a NAD(+) -dependent manner and increases its stability and activity in HEK293 cells. Interestingly, metabolic acidosis increases SIRT7 expression in kidney, as occurs with KCC4. In contrast, total SIRT7-deficient mice present lower KCC4 expression and an exacerbated metabolic acidosis than wild-type mice during an ammonium chloride challenge. Altogether, our data suggest that SIRT7 interacts with, stabilizes and modulates KCC4 activity through deacetylation, and reveals a novel role for SIRT7 in renal physiology.	SIRT7 modulates the stability and activity of the renal K-Cl cotransporter KCC4 through deacetylation.	EMBO reports	0
34031962	Recent studies demonstrate that metabolic disturbance, such as augmented glycolysis, contributes to fibrosis. The molecular regulation of this metabolic perturbation in fibrosis, however, has been elusive. COUP-TFII (also known as NR2F2) is an important regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism. Its contribution to organ fibrosis is undefined. Here, we found increased COUP-TFII expression in myofibroblasts in human fibrotic kidneys, lungs, kidney organoids, and mouse kidneys after injury. Genetic ablation of COUP-TFII in mice resulted in attenuation of injury-induced kidney fibrosis. A non-biased proteomic study revealed the suppression of fatty acid oxidation and the enhancement of glycolysis pathways in COUP-TFII overexpressing fibroblasts. Overexpression of COUP-TFII in fibroblasts also induced production of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) and collagen 1. Knockout of COUP-TFII decreased glycolysis and collagen 1 levels in fibroblasts. Chip-qPCR revealed the binding of COUP-TFII on the promoter of PGC1alpha. Overexpression of COUP-TFII reduced the cellular level of PGC1alpha. Targeting COUP-TFII serves as a novel treatment approach for mitigating fibrosis in chronic kidney disease and potentially fibrosis in other organs.	Orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TFII enhances myofibroblast glycolysis leading to kidney fibrosis.	EMBO reports	0
33950553	Metabolic regulation is critical for the maintenance of pluripotency and the survival of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The transcription factor Tfcp2l1 has emerged as a key factor for the naive pluripotency of ESCs. Here, we report an unexpected role of Tfcp2l1 in metabolic regulation in ESCs-promoting the survival of ESCs through regulating fatty acid oxidation (FAO) under metabolic stress. Tfcp2l1 directly activates many metabolic genes in ESCs. Deletion of Tfcp2l1 leads to an FAO defect associated with upregulation of glucose uptake, the TCA cycle, and glutamine catabolism. Mechanistically, Tfcp2l1 activates FAO by inducing Cpt1a, a rate-limiting enzyme transporting free fatty acids into the mitochondria. ESCs with defective FAO are sensitive to cell death induced by glycolysis inhibition and glutamine deprivation. Moreover, the Tfcp2l1-Cpt1a-FAO axis promotes the survival of quiescent ESCs and diapause-like blastocysts induced by mTOR inhibition. Thus, our results reveal how ESCs orchestrate pluripotent and metabolic programs to ensure their survival in response to metabolic stress.	Fatty acid oxidation is required for embryonic stem cell survival during metabolic stress.	EMBO reports	0
33900016	Mutations in the chromatin remodeller-coding gene CHD7 cause CHARGE syndrome (CS). CS features include moderate to severe neurological and behavioural problems, clinically characterized by intellectual disability, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder. To investigate the poorly characterized neurobiological role of CHD7, we here generate a zebrafish chd7(-/-) model. chd7(-/-) mutants have less GABAergic neurons and exhibit a hyperactivity behavioural phenotype. The GABAergic neuron defect is at least in part due to downregulation of the CHD7 direct target gene paqr3b, and subsequent upregulation of MAPK/ERK signalling, which is also dysregulated in CHD7 mutant human cells. Through a phenotype-based screen in chd7(-/-) zebrafish and Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that the small molecule ephedrine restores normal levels of MAPK/ERK signalling and improves both GABAergic defects and behavioural anomalies. We conclude that chd7 promotes paqr3b expression and that this is required for normal GABAergic network development. This work provides insight into the neuropathogenesis associated with CHD7 deficiency and identifies a promising compound for further preclinical studies.	Chromatin remodeller CHD7 is required for GABAergic neuron development by promoting PAQR3 expression.	EMBO reports	1
33855783	Pathological TDP-43 aggregation is characteristic of several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP); however, how TDP-43 aggregation and function are regulated remain poorly understood. Here, we show that O-GlcNAc transferase OGT-mediated O-GlcNAcylation of TDP-43 suppresses ALS-associated proteinopathies and promotes TDP-43's splicing function. Biochemical and cell-based assays indicate that OGT's catalytic activity suppresses TDP-43 aggregation and hyperphosphorylation, whereas abolishment of TDP-43 O-GlcNAcylation impairs its RNA splicing activity. We further show that TDP-43 mutations in the O-GlcNAcylation sites improve locomotion defects of larvae and adult flies and extend adult life spans, following TDP-43 overexpression in Drosophila motor neurons. We finally demonstrate that O-GlcNAcylation of TDP-43 promotes proper splicing of many mRNAs, including STMN2, which is required for normal axonal outgrowth and regeneration. Our findings suggest that O-GlcNAcylation might be a target for the treatment of TDP-43-linked pathogenesis.	O-GlcNAcylation of TDP-43 suppresses proteinopathies and promotes TDP-43's mRNA splicing activity.	EMBO reports	1
34056831	The recruitment of thermogenic brite adipocytes within white adipose tissue attenuates obesity and metabolic comorbidities, arousing interest in understanding the underlying regulatory mechanisms. The molecular network of brite adipogenesis, however, remains largely unresolved. In this light, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) emerged as a versatile class of modulators that control many steps within the differentiation machinery. Leveraging the naturally varying propensities of different inbred mouse strains for white adipose tissue browning, we identify the nuclear lncRNA Ctcflos as a pivotal orchestrator of thermogenic gene expression during brite adipocyte differentiation. Mechanistically, Ctcflos acts as a pleiotropic regulator, being essential for the transcriptional recruitment of the early core thermogenic regulatory program and the modulation of alternative splicing to drive brite adipogenesis. This is showcased by Ctcflos-regulated gene transcription and splicing of the key browning factor Prdm16 toward the isoform that is specific for the thermogenic gene program. Conclusively, our findings emphasize the mechanistic versatility of lncRNAs acting at several independent levels of gene expression for effective regulation of key differentiation factors to direct cell fate and function.	LncRNA Ctcflos orchestrates transcription and alternative splicing in thermogenic adipogenesis.	EMBO reports	1
33960111	Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) describes the loss of epithelial traits and gain of mesenchymal traits by normal cells during development and by neoplastic cells during cancer metastasis. The long noncoding RNA HOTAIR triggers EMT, in part by serving as a scaffold for PRC2 and thus promoting repressive histone H3K27 methylation. In addition to PRC2, HOTAIR interacts with the LSD1 lysine demethylase, an epigenetic regulator of cell fate during development and differentiation, but little is known about the role of LSD1 in HOTAIR function during EMT. Here, we show that HOTAIR requires its LSD1-interacting domain, but not its PRC2-interacting domain, to promote the migration of epithelial cells. This activity is suppressed by LSD1 overexpression. LSD1-HOTAIR interactions induce partial reprogramming of the epithelial transcriptome altering LSD1 distribution at promoter and enhancer regions. Thus, we uncover an unexpected role of HOTAIR in EMT as an LSD1 decommissioning factor, counteracting its activity in the control of epithelial identity.	HOTAIR lncRNA promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition by redistributing LSD1 at regulatory chromatin regions.	EMBO reports	0
34224210	IkappaBs exert principal functions as cytoplasmic inhibitors of NF-kB transcription factors. Additional roles for IkappaB homologues have been described, including chromatin association and transcriptional regulation. Phosphorylated and SUMOylated IkappaBalpha (pS-IkappaBalpha) binds to histones H2A and H4 in the stem cell and progenitor cell compartment of skin and intestine, but the mechanisms controlling its recruitment to chromatin are largely unknown. Here, we show that serine 32-36 phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha favors its binding to nucleosomes and demonstrate that p-IkappaBalpha association with H4 depends on the acetylation of specific H4 lysine residues. The N-terminal tail of H4 is removed during intestinal cell differentiation by proteolytic cleavage by trypsin or chymotrypsin at residues 17-19, which reduces p-IkappaBalpha binding. Inhibition of trypsin and chymotrypsin activity in HT29 cells increases p-IkappaBalpha chromatin binding but, paradoxically, impaired goblet cell differentiation, comparable to IkappaBalpha deletion. Taken together, our results indicate that dynamic binding of IkappaBalpha to chromatin is a requirement for intestinal cell differentiation and provide a molecular basis for the understanding of the restricted nuclear distribution of p-IkappaBalpha in specific stem cell compartments.	Dynamic chromatin association of IkappaBalpha is regulated by acetylation and cleavage of histone H4.	EMBO reports	0
34224201	Unveiling the molecular mechanisms of tissue remodelling following injury is imperative to elucidate its regenerative capacity and aberrant repair in disease. Using different omics approaches, we identified enhancer of zester homolog 2 (EZH2) as a key regulator of fibrosis in injured lung epithelium. Epithelial injury drives an enrichment of nuclear transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) that mediates EZH2 phosphorylation to facilitate its liberation from polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). This process results in the establishment of a transcriptional complex of EZH2, RNA-polymerase II (POL2) and nuclear actin, which orchestrates aberrant epithelial repair programmes. The liberation of EZH2 from PRC2 is accompanied by an EZH2-EZH1 switch to preserve H3K27me3 deposition at non-target genes. Loss of epithelial TAK1, EZH2 or blocking nuclear actin influx attenuates the fibrotic cascade and restores respiratory homeostasis. Accordingly, EZH2 inhibition significantly improves outcomes in a pulmonary fibrosis mouse model. Our results reveal an important non-canonical function of EZH2, paving the way for new therapeutic interventions in fibrotic lung diseases.	An EZH2-dependent transcriptional complex promotes aberrant epithelial remodelling after injury.	EMBO reports	0
34184805	Snail is a dedicated transcriptional repressor and acts as a master inducer of EMT and metastasis, yet the underlying signaling cascades triggered by Snail still remain elusive. Here, we report that Snail promotes colorectal cancer (CRC) migration by preventing non-coding RNA LOC113230-mediated degradation of argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1). LOC113230 is a novel Snail target gene, and Snail binds to the functional E-boxes within its proximal promoter to repress its expression in response to TGF-beta induction. Ectopic expression of LOC113230 potently suppresses CRC cell growth, migration, and lung metastasis in xenograft experiments. Mechanistically, LOC113230 acts as a scaffold to facilitate recruiting LRPPRC and the TRAF2 E3 ubiquitin ligase to ASS1, resulting in enhanced ubiquitination and degradation of ASS1 and decreased arginine synthesis. Moreover, elevated ASS1 expression is essential for CRC growth and migration. Collectively, these findings suggest that TGF-beta and Snail promote arginine synthesis via inhibiting LOC113230-mediated LRPPRC/TRAF2/ASS1 complex assembly and this complex can serve as potential target for the development of new therapeutic approaches to treat CRC.	Snail enhances arginine synthesis by inhibiting ubiquitination-mediated degradation of ASS1.	EMBO reports	0
34328245	Helicobacter pylori infection constitutes one of the major risk factors for the development of gastric diseases including gastric cancer. The activation of nuclear factor-kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) via classical and alternative pathways is a hallmark of H. pylori infection leading to inflammation in gastric epithelial cells. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-interacting protein with forkhead-associated domain (TIFA) was previously suggested to trigger classical NF-kappaB activation, but its role in alternative NF-kappaB activation remains unexplored. Here, we identify TRAF6 and TRAF2 as binding partners of TIFA, contributing to the formation of TIFAsomes upon H. pylori infection. Importantly, the TIFA/TRAF6 interaction enables binding of TGFbeta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), leading to the activation of classical NF-kappaB signaling, while the TIFA/TRAF2 interaction causes the transient displacement of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (cIAP1) from TRAF2, and proteasomal degradation of cIAP1, to facilitate the activation of the alternative NF-kappaB pathway. Our findings therefore establish a dual function of TIFA in the activation of classical and alternative NF-kappaB signaling in H. pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells.	TIFA has dual functions in Helicobacter pylori-induced classical and alternative NF-kappaB pathways.	EMBO reports	0
34288348	Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that places a heavy strain on public health. Host susceptibility to Mtb is modulated by macrophages, which regulate the balance between cell apoptosis and necrosis. However, the role of molecular switches that modulate apoptosis and necrosis during Mtb infection remains unclear. Here, we show that Mtb-susceptible mice and TB patients have relatively low miR-342-3p expression, while mice with miR-342-3p overexpression are more resistant to Mtb. We demonstrate that the miR-342-3p/SOCS6 axis regulates anti-Mtb immunity by increasing the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Most importantly, the miR-342-3p/SOCS6 axis participates in the switching between Mtb-induced apoptosis and necrosis through A20-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination and RIPK3 degradation. Our findings reveal several strategies by which the host innate immune system controls intracellular Mtb growth via the miRNA-mRNA network and pave the way for host-directed therapies targeting these pathways.

34402565	Striated muscle undergoes remodelling in response to mechanical and physiological stress, but little is known about the integration of such varied signals in the myofibril. The interaction of the elastic kinase region from sarcomeric titin (A168-M1) with the autophagy receptors Nbr1/p62 and MuRF E3 ubiquitin ligases is well suited to link mechanosensing with the trophic response of the myofibril. To investigate the mechanisms of signal cross-talk at this titin node, we elucidated its 3D structure, analysed its response to stretch using steered molecular dynamics simulations and explored its functional relation to MuRF1 and Nbr1/p62 using cellular assays. We found that MuRF1-mediated ubiquitination of titin kinase promotes its scaffolding of Nbr1/p62 and that the process can be dynamically down-regulated by the mechanical unfolding of a linker sequence joining titin kinase with the MuRF1 receptor site in titin. We propose that titin ubiquitination is sensitive to the mechanical state of the sarcomere, the regulation of sarcomere targeting by Nbr1/p62 being a functional outcome. We conclude that MuRF1/Titin Kinase/Nbr1/p62 constitutes a distinct assembly that predictably promotes sarcomere breakdown in inactive muscle.	Titin kinase ubiquitination aligns autophagy receptors with mechanical signals in the sarcomere.	EMBO reports	0
34396669	Phospholipase D (PLD) hydrolyzes membrane lipids to produce phosphatidic acid (PA), a lipid mediator involved in various cellular and physiological processes. Here, we show that PLDalpha6 and PA regulate the distribution of GIBBERELLIN (GA)-INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1), a soluble gibberellin receptor in rice. PLDalpha6-knockout (KO) plants display less sensitivity to GA than WT, and PA restores the mutant to a normal GA response. PA binds to GID1, as documented by liposome binding, fat immunoblotting, and surface plasmon resonance. Arginines 79 and 82 of GID1 are two key amino acid residues required for PA binding and also for GID1's nuclear localization. The loss of PLDalpha6 impedes GA-induced nuclear localization of GID1. In addition, PLDalpha6-KO plants attenuated GA-induced degradation of the DELLA protein SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1). These data suggest that PLDalpha6 and PA positively mediate GA signaling in rice via PA binding to GID1 and promotion of its nuclear translocation.	Phospholipase Dalpha6 and phosphatidic acid regulate gibberellin signaling in rice.	EMBO reports	0
32989251	Alveolar epithelial regeneration is essential for recovery from devastating lung diseases. This process occurs when type II alveolar pneumocytes (AT2 cells) proliferate and transdifferentiate into type I alveolar pneumocytes (AT1 cells). We used genome-wide analysis of chromatin accessibility and gene expression following acute lung injury to elucidate repair mechanisms. AT2 chromatin accessibility changed substantially following injury to reveal STAT3 binding motifs adjacent to genes that regulate essential regenerative pathways. Single-cell transcriptome analysis identified brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) as a STAT3 target gene with newly accessible chromatin in a unique population of regenerating AT2 cells. Furthermore, the BDNF receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) was enriched on mesenchymal alveolar niche cells (MANCs). Loss or blockade of AT2-specific Stat3, Bdnf or mesenchyme-specific TrkB compromised repair and reduced Fgf7 expression by niche cells. A TrkB agonist improved outcomes in vivo following lung injury. These data highlight the biological and therapeutic importance of the STAT3-BDNF-TrkB axis in orchestrating alveolar epithelial regeneration.

33106653	Dystrophin proteomic regulation in muscular dystrophies (MDs) remains unclear. We report that a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), H19, associates with dystrophin and inhibits E3-ligase-dependent polyubiquitination at Lys 3584 (referred to as Ub-DMD) and its subsequent protein degradation. In-frame deletions in BMD and a DMD non-silent mutation (C3340Y) resulted in defects in the ability of the protein to interact with H19, which caused elevated Ub-DMD levels and dystrophin degradation. Dmd C3333Y mice exhibited progressive MD, elevated serum creatine kinase, heart dilation, blood vessel irregularity and respiratory failure with concurrently reduced dystrophin and increased Ub-DMD status. H19 RNA oligonucleotides conjugated with agrin (AGR-H19) and nifenazone competed with or inhibited TRIM63. Dmd C3333Y animals, induced-pluripotent-stem-cell-derived skeletal muscle cells from patients with Becker MD and mdx mice subjected to exon skipping exhibited inhibited dystrophin degradation, preserved skeletal and cardiac muscle histology, and improved strength and heart function following AGR-H19 or nifenazone treatment. Our study paves the way for meaningful targeted therapeutics for Becker MD and for certain patients with Duchenne MD.	The lncRNA H19 alleviates muscular dystrophy by stabilizing dystrophin.

33020597	PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are abundantly expressed during cardiac hypertrophy. However, their functions and molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we identified a cardiac-hypertrophy-associated piRNA (CHAPIR) that promotes pathological hypertrophy and cardiac remodelling by targeting METTL3-mediated N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) methylation of Parp10 mRNA transcripts. CHAPIR deletion markedly attenuates cardiac hypertrophy and restores heart function, while administration of a CHAPIR mimic enhances the pathological hypertrophic response in pressure-overloaded mice. Mechanistically, CHAPIR-PIWIL4 complexes directly interact with METTL3 and block the m(6)A methylation of Parp10 mRNA transcripts, which upregulates PARP10 expression. The CHAPIR-dependent increase in PARP10 promotes the mono-ADP-ribosylation of GSK3beta and inhibits its kinase activity, which results in the accumulation of nuclear NFATC4 and the progression of pathological hypertrophy. Hence, our findings reveal that a piRNA-mediated RNA epigenetic mechanism is involved in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy and that the CHAPIR-METTL3-PARP10-NFATC4 signalling axis could be therapeutically targeted for treating pathological hypertrophy and maladaptive cardiac remodelling.	The piRNA CHAPIR regulates cardiac hypertrophy by controlling METTL3-dependent N(6)-methyladenosine methylation of Parp10 mRNA.	Nature cell biology	0
33230303	Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) have been the focus of developmental and regenerative studies, yet our understanding of the signalling events regulating their specification remains incomplete. We demonstrate that supt16h, a component of the Facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) complex, is required for HSPC formation. Zebrafish supt16h mutants express reduced levels of Notch-signalling components, genes essential for HSPC development, due to abrogated transcription. Whereas global chromatin accessibility in supt16h mutants is not substantially altered, we observe a specific increase in p53 accessibility, causing an accumulation of p53. We further demonstrate that p53 influences expression of the Polycomb-group protein PHC1, which functions as a transcriptional repressor of Notch genes. Suppression of phc1 or its upstream regulator, p53, rescues the loss of both Notch and HSPC phenotypes in supt16h mutants. Our results highlight a relationship between supt16h, p53 and phc1 to specify HSPCs via modulation of Notch signalling.	Haematopoietic stem cell-dependent Notch transcription is mediated by p53 through the Histone chaperone Supt16h.	Nature cell biology	0
33723425	The complexity of intracellular signalling requires both a diversity of molecular players and the sequestration of activity to unique compartments within the cell. Recent findings on the role of liquid-liquid phase separation provide a distinct mechanism for the spatial segregation of proteins to regulate signalling pathway crosstalk. Here, we discover that DACT1 is induced by TGFbeta and forms protein condensates in the cytoplasm to repress Wnt signalling. These condensates do not localize to any known organelles but, rather, exist as phase-separated proteinaceous cytoplasmic bodies. The deletion of intrinsically disordered domains within the DACT1 protein eliminates its ability to both form protein condensates and suppress Wnt signalling. Isolation and mass spectrometry analysis of these particles revealed a complex of protein machinery that sequesters casein kinase 2-a Wnt pathway activator. We further demonstrate that DACT1 condensates are maintained in vivo and that DACT1 is critical to breast and prostate cancer bone metastasis.	TGF-beta-induced DACT1 biomolecular condensates repress Wnt signalling to promote bone metastasis.	Nature cell biology	1
33664496	Activated EGFR signalling drives tumorigenicity in 50% of glioblastoma (GBM). However, EGFR-targeting therapy has proven ineffective in treating patients with GBM, indicating that there is redundant EGFR activation. Circular RNAs are covalently closed RNA transcripts that are involved in various physiological and pathological processes. Herein, we report an additional activation mechanism of EGFR signalling in GBM by an undescribed secretory E-cadherin protein variant (C-E-Cad) encoded by a circular E-cadherin (circ-E-Cad) RNA through multiple-round open reading frame translation. C-E-Cad is overexpressed in GBM and promotes glioma stem cell tumorigenicity. C-E-Cad activates EGFR independent of EGF through association with the EGFR CR2 domain using a unique 14-amino-acid carboxy terminus, thereby maintaining glioma stem cell tumorigenicity. Notably, inhibition of C-E-Cad markedly enhances the antitumour activity of therapeutic anti-EGFR strategies in GBM. Our results uncover a critical role of C-E-Cad in stimulating EGFR signalling and provide a promising approach for treating EGFR-driven GBM.

33795871	Endothelial cells (ECs) adapt their metabolism to enable the growth of new blood vessels, but little is known how ECs regulate metabolism to adopt a quiescent state. Here, we show that the metabolite S-2-hydroxyglutarate (S-2HG) plays a crucial role in the regulation of endothelial quiescence. We find that S-2HG is produced in ECs after activation of the transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), where it limits cell cycle progression, metabolic activity and vascular expansion. FOXO1 stimulates S-2HG production by inhibiting the mitochondrial enzyme 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. This inhibition relies on branched-chain amino acid catabolites such as 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate, which increase in ECs with activated FOXO1. Treatment of ECs with 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate elicits S-2HG production and suppresses proliferation, causing vascular rarefaction in mice. Our findings identify a metabolic programme that promotes the acquisition of a quiescent endothelial state and highlight the role of metabolites as signalling molecules in the endothelium.

32857952	(p)ppGpp is a nucleotide messenger universally produced in bacteria following nutrient starvation. In E. coli, ppGpp inhibits purine nucleotide synthesis by targeting several different enzymes, but the physiological significance of their inhibition is unknown. Here, we report the structural basis of inhibition for one target, Gsk, the inosine-guanosine kinase. Gsk creates an unprecedented, allosteric binding pocket for ppGpp by restructuring terminal sequences, which restrains conformational dynamics necessary for catalysis. Guided by this structure, we generated a chromosomal mutation that abolishes Gsk regulation by ppGpp. This mutant strain accumulates abnormally high levels of purine nucleotides following amino-acid starvation, compromising cellular fitness. We demonstrate that this unrestricted increase in purine nucleotides is detrimental because it severely depletes pRpp and essential, pRpp-derived metabolites, including UTP, histidine, and tryptophan. Thus, our results reveal the significance of ppGpp's regulation of purine nucleotide synthesis and a critical mechanism by which E. coli coordinates biosynthetic processes during starvation.	ppGpp Coordinates Nucleotide and Amino-Acid Synthesis in E. coli During Starvation.

33065020	The PTEN tumor suppressor controls cell death and survival by regulating functions of various molecular targets. While the role of PTEN lipid-phosphatase activity on PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and inhibition of PI3K pathway is well characterized, the biological relevance of PTEN protein-phosphatase activity remains undefined. Here, using knockin (KI) mice harboring cancer-associated and functionally relevant missense mutations, we show that although loss of PTEN lipid-phosphatase function cooperates with oncogenic PI3K to promote rapid mammary tumorigenesis, the additional loss of PTEN protein-phosphatase activity triggered an extensive cell death response evident in early and advanced mammary tumors. Omics and drug-targeting studies revealed that PI3Ks act to reduce glucocorticoid receptor (GR) levels, which are rescued by loss of PTEN protein-phosphatase activity to restrain cell survival. Thus, we find that the dual regulation of GR by PI3K and PTEN functions as a rheostat that can be exploited for the treatment of PTEN loss-driven cancers.

32966759	Efficient release of promoter-proximally paused RNA Pol II into productive elongation is essential for gene expression. Recently, we reported that the Integrator complex can bind paused RNA Pol II and drive premature transcription termination, potently attenuating the activity of target genes. Premature termination requires RNA cleavage by the endonuclease subunit of Integrator, but the roles of other Integrator subunits in gene regulation have yet to be elucidated. Here we report that Integrator subunit 8 (IntS8) is critical for transcription repression and required for association with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). We find that Integrator-bound PP2A dephosphorylates the RNA Pol II C-terminal domain and Spt5, preventing the transition to productive elongation. Thus, blocking PP2A association with Integrator stimulates pause release and gene activity. These results reveal a second catalytic function associated with Integrator-mediated transcription termination and indicate that control of productive elongation involves active competition between transcriptional kinases and phosphatases.

33157015	Although TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers, the p53-dependent transcriptional programs mediating tumor suppression remain incompletely understood. Here, to uncover critical components downstream of p53 in tumor suppression, we perform unbiased RNAi and CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic screens in vivo. These screens converge upon the p53-inducible gene Zmat3, encoding an RNA-binding protein, and we demonstrate that ZMAT3 is an important tumor suppressor downstream of p53 in mouse Kras(G12D)-driven lung and liver cancers and human carcinomas. Integrative analysis of the ZMAT3 RNA-binding landscape and transcriptomic profiling reveals that ZMAT3 directly modulates exon inclusion in transcripts encoding proteins of diverse functions, including the p53 inhibitors MDM4 and MDM2, splicing regulators, and components of varied cellular processes. Interestingly, these exons are enriched in NMD signals, and, accordingly, ZMAT3 broadly affects target transcript stability. Collectively, these studies reveal ZMAT3 as a novel RNA-splicing and homeostasis regulator and a key component of p53-mediated tumor suppression.

33171122	Extracellular 2'3'-cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP) is an immunotransmitter exported by diseased cells and imported into host cells to activate the innate immune STING pathway. We previously identified SLC19A1 as a cGAMP importer, but its use across human cell lines is limited. Here, we identify LRRC8A heteromeric channels, better known as volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC), as widely expressed cGAMP transporters. LRRC8A forms complexes with LRRC8C and/or LRRC8E, depending on their expression levels, to transport cGAMP and other 2'3'-cyclic dinucleotides. In contrast, LRRC8D inhibits cGAMP transport. We demonstrate that cGAMP is effluxed or influxed via LRRC8 channels, as dictated by the cGAMP electrochemical gradient. Activation of LRRC8A channels, which can occur under diverse stresses, strongly potentiates cGAMP transport. We identify activator sphingosine 1-phosphate and inhibitor DCPIB as chemical tools to manipulate channel-mediated cGAMP transport. Finally, LRRC8A channels are key cGAMP transporters in resting primary human vasculature cells and universal human cGAMP transporters when activated.

33098764	The phosphoinositide PI(3,5)P2, generated exclusively by the PIKfyve lipid kinase complex, is key for lysosomal biology. Here, we explore how PI(3,5)P2 levels within cells are regulated. We find the PIKfyve complex comprises five copies of the scaffolding protein Vac14 and one copy each of the lipid kinase PIKfyve, generating PI(3,5)P2 from PI3P and the lipid phosphatase Fig4, reversing the reaction. Fig4 is active as a lipid phosphatase in the ternary complex, whereas PIKfyve within the complex cannot access membrane-incorporated phosphoinositides due to steric constraints. We find further that the phosphoinositide-directed activities of both PIKfyve and Fig4 are regulated by protein-directed activities within the complex. PIKfyve autophosphorylation represses its lipid kinase activity and stimulates Fig4 lipid phosphatase activity. Further, Fig4 is also a protein phosphatase acting on PIKfyve to stimulate its lipid kinase activity, explaining why catalytically active Fig4 is required for maximal PI(3,5)P2 production by PIKfyve in vivo.

33275888	The anti-tumor potency of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPis) has been linked to trapping of PARP1 on damaged chromatin. However, little is known about their impact on PARP2, an isoform with overlapping functions at DNA lesions. Whether the release of PARP1/2 from DNA lesions is actively catalyzed by molecular machines is also not known. We found that PARPis robustly trap PARP2 and that the helicase ALC1 (CHD1L) is strictly required for PARP2 release. Catalytic inactivation of ALC1 quantitatively traps PARP2 but not PARP1. ALC1 manipulation impacts the response to single-strand DNA breaks through PARP2 trapping, potentiates PARPi-induced cancer cell killing, and mediates synthetic lethality upon BRCA deficiency. The chromatin remodeler ALC1 actively drives PARP2 turnover from DNA lesions, and PARP2 contributes to the cellular responses of PARPi. This suggests that disrupting the ATP-fueled remodeling forces of ALC1 might enable therapies that selectively target the DNA repair functions of PARPs in cancer.

33232656	Locus control region (LCR) functions define cellular identity and have critical roles in diseases such as cancer, although the hierarchy of structural components and associated factors that drive functionality are incompletely understood. Here we show that OCA-B, a B cell-specific coactivator essential for germinal center (GC) formation, forms a ternary complex with the lymphoid-enriched OCT2 and GC-specific MEF2B transcription factors and that this complex occupies and activates an LCR that regulates the BCL6 proto-oncogene and is uniquely required by normal and malignant GC B cells. Mechanistically, through OCA-B-MED1 interactions, this complex is required for Mediator association with the BCL6 promoter. Densely tiled CRISPRi screening indicates that only LCR segments heavily bound by this ternary complex are essential for its function. Our results demonstrate how an intimately linked complex of lineage- and stage-specific factors converges on specific and highly essential enhancer elements to drive the function of a cell-type-defining LCR.

33202251	"Mechanisms that control mobilization of cytosolic calcium [Ca(2+)]i are key for regulation of numerous eukaryotic cell functions. One such paradigmatic mechanism involves activation of phospholipase Cbeta (PLCbeta) enzymes by G protein betagamma subunits from activated Galphai-Gbetagamma heterotrimers. Here, we report identification of a master switch to enable this control for PLCbeta enzymes in living cells. We find that the Galphai-Gbetagamma-PLCbeta-Ca(2+) signaling module is entirely dependent on the presence of active Galphaq. If Galphaq is pharmacologically inhibited or genetically ablated, Gbetagamma can bind to PLCbeta but does not elicit Ca(2+) signals. Removal of an auto-inhibitory linker that occludes the active site of the enzyme is required and sufficient to empower ""stand-alone control"" of PLCbeta by Gbetagamma. This dependence of Gi-Gbetagamma-Ca(2+) on Galphaq places an entire signaling branch of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) under hierarchical control of Gq and changes our understanding of how Gi-GPCRs trigger [Ca(2+)]i via PLCbeta enzymes."

33296677	Replication fork reversal is a global response to replication stress in mammalian cells, but precisely how it occurs remains poorly understood. Here, we show that, upon replication stress, DNA topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) is recruited to stalled forks in a manner dependent on the SNF2-family DNA translocases HLTF, ZRANB3, and SMARCAL1. This is accompanied by an increase in TOP2A SUMOylation mediated by the SUMO E3 ligase ZATT and followed by recruitment of a SUMO-targeted DNA translocase, PICH. Disruption of the ZATT-TOP2A-PICH axis results in accumulation of partially reversed forks and enhanced genome instability. These results suggest that fork reversal occurs via a sequential two-step process. First, HLTF, ZRANB3, and SMARCAL1 initiate limited fork reversal, creating superhelical strain in the newly replicated sister chromatids. Second, TOP2A drives extensive fork reversal by resolving the resulting topological barriers and via its role in recruiting PICH to stalled forks.

33278361	Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) is a highly conserved complex with key roles in various aspects of DNA repair. Here, we report a new function for MRX in limiting transcription in budding yeast. We show that MRX interacts physically and colocalizes on chromatin with the transcriptional co-regulator Mediator. MRX restricts transcription of coding and noncoding DNA by a mechanism that does not require the nuclease activity of Mre11. MRX is required to tether transcriptionally active loci to the nuclear pore complex (NPC), and it also promotes large-scale gene-NPC interactions. Moreover, MRX-mediated chromatin anchoring to the NPC contributes to chromosome folding and helps to control gene expression. Together, these findings indicate that MRX has a role in transcription and chromosome organization that is distinct from its known function in DNA repair.

33340489	Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) controls cell growth and proliferation by sensing fluctuations in environmental cues such as nutrients, growth factors, and energy levels. The Rag GTPases (Rags) serve as a critical module that signals amino acid (AA) availability to modulate mTORC1 localization and activity. Recent studies have demonstrated how AAs regulate mTORC1 activity through Rags. Here, we uncover an unconventional pathway that activates mTORC1 in response to variations in threonine (Thr) levels via mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA synthetase TARS2. TARS2 interacts with inactive Rags, particularly GTP-RagC, leading to increased GTP loading of RagA. mTORC1 activity in cells lacking TARS2 is resistant to Thr repletion, showing that TARS2 is necessary for Thr-dependent mTORC1 activation. The requirement of TARS2, but not cytoplasmic threonyl-tRNA synthetase TARS, for this effect demonstrates an additional layer of complexity in the regulation of mTORC1 activity.	Mitochondrial Threonyl-tRNA Synthetase TARS2 Is Required for Threonine-Sensitive mTORC1 Activation.	Molecular cell	0
33301730	Metazoan transcription factors typically regulate large numbers of genes. Here we identify via a CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen ZNF410, a pentadactyl DNA-binding protein that in human erythroid cells directly activates only a single gene, the NuRD component CHD4. Specificity is conveyed by two highly evolutionarily conserved clusters of ZNF410 binding sites near the CHD4 gene with no counterparts elsewhere in the genome. Loss of ZNF410 in adult-type human erythroid cell culture systems and xenotransplantation settings diminishes CHD4 levels and derepresses the fetal hemoglobin genes. While previously known to be silenced by CHD4, the fetal globin genes are exposed here as among the most sensitive to reduced CHD4 levels.. In vitro DNA binding assays and crystallographic studies reveal the ZNF410-DNA binding mode. ZNF410 is a remarkably selective transcriptional activator in erythroid cells, and its perturbation might offer new opportunities for treatment of hemoglobinopathies.

33545059	Eukaryotic genomes replicate via spatially and temporally regulated origin firing. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) promote origin firing, whereas the S phase checkpoint limits firing to prevent nucleotide and RPA exhaustion. We used chemical genetics to interrogate human DDK with maximum precision, dissect its relationship with the S phase checkpoint, and identify DDK substrates. We show that DDK inhibition (DDKi) leads to graded suppression of origin firing and fork arrest. S phase checkpoint inhibition rescued origin firing in DDKi cells and DDK-depleted Xenopus egg extracts. DDKi also impairs RPA loading, nascent-strand protection, and fork restart. Via quantitative phosphoproteomics, we identify the BRCA1-associated (BRCA1-A) complex subunit MERIT40 and the cohesin accessory subunit PDS5B as DDK effectors in fork protection and restart. Phosphorylation neutralizes autoinhibition mediated by intrinsically disordered regions in both substrates. Our results reveal mechanisms through which DDK controls the duplication of large vertebrate genomes.

33400924	As a master regulator of metabolism, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated upon energy and glucose shortage but suppressed upon overnutrition. Exaggerated negative regulation of AMPK signaling by nutrient overload plays a crucial role in metabolic diseases. However, the mechanism underlying the negative regulation is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that high glucose represses AMPK signaling via MG53 (also called TRIM72) E3-ubiquitin-ligase-mediated AMPKalpha degradation and deactivation. Specifically, high-glucose-stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals AKT to phosphorylate AMPKalpha at S485/491, which facilitates the recruitment of MG53 and the subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of AMPKalpha. In addition, high glucose deactivates AMPK by ROS-dependent suppression of phosphorylation of AMPKalpha at T172. These findings not only delineate the mechanism underlying the impairment of AMPK signaling in overnutrition-related diseases but also highlight the significance of keeping the yin-yang balance of AMPK signaling in the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis.

33476576	Micronuclei are aberrant nuclear compartments that can form as a result of chromosome mis-segregation. Frequent loss of micronuclear envelope integrity exposes DNA to the cytoplasm, leading to chromosome fragmentation and immune activation. Here, we use micronuclei purification to show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated nuclease TREX1 inhibits cGAS activation at micronuclei by degrading micronuclear DNA upon micronuclear envelope rupture. We demonstrate that the ER accesses ruptured micronuclei and plays a critical role in enabling TREX1 nucleolytic attack. TREX1 mutations, previously implicated in immune disease, untether TREX1 from the ER, disrupt TREX1 localization to micronuclei, diminish micronuclear DNA damage, and enhance cGAS activation. These results establish ER-directed resection of micronuclear DNA by TREX1 as a critical regulator of cytosolic DNA sensing in chromosomally unstable cells and provide a mechanistic basis for the importance of TREX1 ER tethering in preventing autoimmunity.

33606996	Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-mediated adaptive resistance is one major barrier to improving immunotherapy in solid tumors. However, the mechanisms are not completely understood. Here, we report that IFN-gamma promotes nuclear translocation and phase separation of YAP after anti-PD-1 therapy in tumor cells. Hydrophobic interactions of the YAP coiled-coil domain mediate droplet initiation, and weak interactions of the intrinsically disordered region in the C terminus promote droplet formation. YAP partitions with the transcription factor TEAD4, the histone acetyltransferase EP300, and Mediator1 and forms transcriptional hubs for maximizing target gene transcriptions, independent of the canonical STAT1-IRF1 transcription program. Disruption of YAP phase separation reduced tumor growth, enhanced immune response, and sensitized tumor cells to anti-PD-1 therapy. YAP activity is negatively correlated with patient outcome. Our study indicates that YAP mediates the IFN-gamma pro-tumor effect through its nuclear phase separation and suggests that YAP can be used as a predictive biomarker and target of anti-PD-1 combination therapy.

33581076	Type I interferons (IFNs) are critical cytokines in the host defense against invading pathogens. Sustained production of IFNs, however, is detrimental to the host, as it provokes autoimmune diseases. Thus, the expression of IFNs is tightly controlled. We report that the mRNA 5' cap-binding protein 4EHP plays a key role in regulating type I IFN concomitant with controlling virus replication, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, 4EHP suppresses IFN-beta production by effecting the miR-34a-induced translational silencing of Ifnb1 mRNA. miR-34a is upregulated by both RNA virus infection and IFN-beta induction, prompting a negative feedback regulatory mechanism that represses IFN-beta expression via 4EHP. These findings demonstrate the direct involvement of 4EHP in virus-induced host response, underscoring a critical translational silencing mechanism mediated by 4EHP and miR-34a to impede sustained IFN production. This study highlights an intrinsic regulatory function for miRNA and the translation machinery in maintaining host homeostasis.	microRNA-induced translational control of antiviral immunity by the cap-binding protein 4EHP.

33725486	"Phospholipid scrambling in dying cells promotes phosphatidylserine exposure, a critical process for efferocytosis. We previously identified the Xkr family protein Xkr4 as a phospholipid-scrambling protein, but its activation mechanisms remain unknown. Here we show that Xkr4 is activated in two steps: dimer formation by caspase-mediated cleavage and structural change caused by activating factors. To identify the factors, we developed a new screening system, ""revival screening,"" using a CRISPR sgRNA library. Applying this system, we identified the nuclear protein XRCC4 as the single candidate for the Xkr4 activator. Upon apoptotic stimuli, XRCC4, contained in the DNA repair complex, is cleaved by caspases, and its C-terminal fragment with an intrinsically disordered region is released into the cytoplasm. Protein interaction screening showed that the fragment interacts directly with the Xkr4 dimer to activate it. This study demonstrates that caspase-mediated cleavage releases a nuclear protein fragment for direct regulation of lipid dynamics on the plasma membrane."

33662272	Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) mediates translocation of peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosomal A site to the P site to promote translational elongation. Its phosphorylation on Thr56 by its single known kinase eEF2K inactivates it and inhibits translational elongation. Extensive studies have revealed that different signal cascades modulate eEF2K activity, but whether additional factors regulate phosphorylation of eEF2 remains unclear. Here, we find that the X chromosome-linked intellectual disability protein polyglutamine-binding protein 1 (PQBP1) specifically binds to non-phosphorylated eEF2 and suppresses eEF2K-mediated phosphorylation at Thr56. Loss of PQBP1 significantly reduces general protein synthesis by suppressing translational elongation. Moreover, we show that PQBP1 regulates hippocampal metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) and mGluR-LTD-associated behaviors by suppressing eEF2K-mediated phosphorylation. Our results identify PQBP1 as a novel regulator in translational elongation and mGluR-LTD, and this newly revealed regulator in the eEF2K/eEF2 pathway is also an excellent therapeutic target for various disease conditions, such as neural diseases, virus infection, and cancer.

33626321	The DREAM complex orchestrates cell quiescence and the cell cycle. However, how the DREAM complex is deregulated in cancer remains elusive. Here, we report that PAF (PCLAF/KIAA0101) drives cell quiescence exit to promote lung tumorigenesis by remodeling the DREAM complex. PAF is highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and is associated with poor prognosis. Importantly, Paf knockout markedly suppressed LUAD development in mouse models. PAF depletion induced LUAD cell quiescence and growth arrest. PAF is required for the global expression of cell-cycle genes controlled by the repressive DREAM complex. Mechanistically, PAF inhibits DREAM complex formation by binding to RBBP4, a core DREAM subunit, leading to transactivation of DREAM target genes. Furthermore, pharmacological mimicking of PAF-depleted transcriptomes inhibited LUAD tumor growth. Our results unveil how the PAF-remodeled DREAM complex bypasses cell quiescence to promote lung tumorigenesis and suggest that the PAF-DREAM axis may be a therapeutic vulnerability in lung cancer.

33761311	The initiation of DNA replication involves cell cycle-dependent assembly and disassembly of protein complexes, including the origin recognition complex (ORC) and CDC6 AAA(+) ATPases. We report that multiple short linear protein motifs (SLiMs) within intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in ORC1 and CDC6 mediate cyclin-CDK-dependent and independent protein-protein interactions, conditional on the cell cycle phase. A domain within the ORC1 IDR is required for interaction between the ORC1 and CDC6 AAA(+) domains in G1, whereas the same domain prevents CDC6-ORC1 interaction during mitosis. Then, during late G1, this domain facilitates ORC1 destruction by a SKP2-cyclin A-CDK2-dependent mechanism. During G1, the CDC6 Cy motif cooperates with cyclin E-CDK2 to promote ORC1-CDC6 interactions. The CDC6 IDR regulates self-interaction by ORC1, thereby controlling ORC1 protein levels. Protein phosphatase 1 binds directly to a SLiM in the ORC1 IDR, causing ORC1 de-phosphorylation upon mitotic exit, increasing ORC1 protein, and promoting pre-RC assembly.	Multiple, short protein binding motifs in ORC1 and CDC6 control the initiation of DNA replication.	Molecular cell	1
33743194	The conserved Gcn2 protein kinase mediates cellular adaptations to amino acid limitation through translational control of gene expression that is exclusively executed by phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha). Using quantitative phosphoproteomics, however, we discovered that Gcn2 targets auxiliary effectors to modulate translation. Accordingly, Gcn2 also phosphorylates the beta-subunit of the trimeric eIF2 G protein complex to promote its association with eIF5, which prevents spontaneous nucleotide exchange on eIF2 and thereby restricts the recycling of the initiator methionyl-tRNA-bound eIF2-GDP ternary complex in amino-acid-starved cells. This mechanism contributes to the inhibition of translation initiation in parallel to the sequestration of the nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B by phosphorylated eIF2alpha. Gcn2 further phosphorylates Gcn20 to antagonize, in an inhibitory feedback loop, the formation of the Gcn2-stimulatory Gcn1-Gcn20 complex. Thus, Gcn2 plays a substantially more intricate role in controlling translation initiation than hitherto appreciated.

33657401	"O-linked beta-N-acetyl glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is attached to proteins under glucose-replete conditions; this posttranslational modification results in molecular and physiological changes that affect cell fate. Here we show that posttranslational modification of serine/arginine-rich protein kinase 2 (SRPK2) by O-GlcNAc regulates de novo lipogenesis by regulating pre-mRNA splicing. We found that O-GlcNAc transferase O-GlcNAcylated SRPK2 at a nuclear localization signal (NLS), which triggers binding of SRPK2 to importin alpha. Consequently, O-GlcNAcylated SRPK2 was imported into the nucleus, where it phosphorylated serine/arginine-rich proteins and promoted splicing of lipogenic pre-mRNAs. We determined that protein nuclear import by O-GlcNAcylation-dependent binding of cargo protein to importin alpha might be a general mechanism in cells. This work reveals a role of O-GlcNAc in posttranscriptional regulation of de novo lipogenesis, and our findings indicate that importin alpha is a ""reader"" of an O-GlcNAcylated NLS."

33974912	Meningioma-1 (MN1) overexpression in AML is associated with poor prognosis, and forced expression of MN1 induces leukemia in mice. We sought to determine how MN1 causes AML. We found that overexpression of MN1 can be induced by translocations that result in hijacking of a downstream enhancer. Structure predictions revealed that the entire MN1 coding frame is disordered. We identified the myeloid progenitor-specific BAF complex as the key interaction partner of MN1. MN1 over-stabilizes BAF on enhancer chromatin, a function directly linked to the presence of a long polyQ-stretch within MN1. BAF over-stabilization at binding sites of transcription factors regulating a hematopoietic stem/progenitor program prevents the developmentally appropriate decommissioning of these enhancers and results in impaired myeloid differentiation and leukemia. Beyond AML, our data detail how the overexpression of a polyQ protein, in the absence of any coding sequence mutation, can be sufficient to cause malignant transformation.

33852894	Small RNA pathways defend the germlines of animals against selfish genetic elements, yet pathway activities need to be contained to prevent silencing of self genes. Here, we reveal a proteolytic mechanism that controls endogenous small interfering (22G) RNA activity in the Caenorhabditis elegans germline to protect genome integrity and maintain fertility. We find that DPF-3, a P-granule-localized N-terminal dipeptidase orthologous to mammalian dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) 8/9, processes the unusually proline-rich N termini of WAGO-1 and WAGO-3 Argonaute (Ago) proteins. Without DPF-3 activity, these WAGO proteins lose their proper complement of 22G RNAs. Desilencing of repeat-containing and transposon-derived transcripts, DNA damage, and acute sterility ensue. These phenotypes are recapitulated when WAGO-1 and WAGO-3 are rendered resistant to DPF-3-mediated processing, identifying them as critical substrates of DPF-3. We conclude that N-terminal processing of Ago proteins regulates their activity and promotes silencing of selfish genetic elements by ensuring Ago association with appropriate small RNAs.	Protease-mediated processing of Argonaute proteins controls small RNA association.	Molecular cell	1
34081901	Metabolic reprogramming is a common feature of many human cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the upstream regulators that promote AML metabolic reprogramming and the benefits conferred to leukemia cells by these metabolic changes remain largely unknown. We report that the transcription factor ATF3 coordinates serine and nucleotide metabolism to maintain cell cycling, survival, and the differentiation blockade in AML. Analysis of mouse and human AML models demonstrate that ATF3 directly activates the transcription of genes encoding key enzymatic regulators of serine synthesis, one-carbon metabolism, and de novo purine and pyrimidine synthesis. Total steady-state polar metabolite and heavy isotope tracing analyses show that ATF3 inhibition reduces de novo serine synthesis, impedes the incorporation of serine-derived carbons into newly synthesized purines, and disrupts pyrimidine metabolism. Importantly, exogenous nucleotide supplementation mitigates the anti-leukemia effects of ATF3 inhibition. Together, these findings reveal the dependence of AML on ATF3-regulated serine and nucleotide metabolism.

33979575	DNA replication initiates at genomic locations known as origins of replication, which, in S. cerevisiae, share a common DNA consensus motif. Despite being virtually nucleosome-free, origins of replication are greatly influenced by the surrounding chromatin state. Here, we show that histone H3 lysine 37 mono-methylation (H3K37me1) is catalyzed by Set1p and Set2p and that it regulates replication origin licensing. H3K37me1 is uniformly distributed throughout most of the genome, but it is scarce at replication origins, where it increases according to the timing of their firing. We find that H3K37me1 hinders Mcm2 interaction with chromatin, maintaining low levels of MCM outside of conventional replication origins. Lack of H3K37me1 results in defective DNA replication from canonical origins while promoting replication events at inefficient and non-canonical sites. Collectively, our results indicate that H3K37me1 ensures correct execution of the DNA replication program by protecting the genome from inappropriate origin licensing and spurious DNA replication.	Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 37 by Set1 and Set2 prevents spurious DNA replication.	Molecular cell	1
33974911	The TSC complex is a critical negative regulator of the small GTPase Rheb and mTORC1 in cellular stress signaling. The TSC2 subunit contains a catalytic GTPase activating protein domain and interacts with multiple regulators, while the precise function of TSC1 is unknown. Here we provide a structural characterization of TSC1 and define three domains: a C-terminal coiled-coil that interacts with TSC2, a central helical domain that mediates TSC1 oligomerization, and an N-terminal HEAT repeat domain that interacts with membrane phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs). TSC1 architecture, oligomerization, and membrane binding are conserved in fungi and humans. We show that lysosomal recruitment of the TSC complex and subsequent inactivation of mTORC1 upon starvation depend on the marker lipid PI3,5P2, demonstrating a role for lysosomal PIPs in regulating TSC complex and mTORC1 activity via TSC1. Our study thus identifies a vital role of TSC1 in TSC complex function and mTORC1 signaling.	TSC1 binding to lysosomal PIPs is required for TSC complex translocation and mTORC1 regulation.

33932350	DNA polymerase epsilon (Polepsilon) carries out high-fidelity leading strand synthesis owing to its exonuclease activity. Polepsilon polymerase and exonuclease activities are balanced, because of partitioning of nascent DNA strands between catalytic sites, so that net resection occurs when synthesis is impaired. In vivo, DNA synthesis stalling activates replication checkpoint kinases, which act to preserve the functional integrity of replication forks. We show that stalled Polepsilon drives nascent strand resection causing fork functional collapse, averted via checkpoint-dependent phosphorylation. Polepsilon catalytic subunit Pol2 is phosphorylated on serine 430, influencing partitioning between polymerase and exonuclease active sites. A phosphormimetic S430D change reduces exonucleolysis in vitro and counteracts fork collapse. Conversely, non-phosphorylatable pol2-S430A expression causes resection-driven stressed fork defects. Our findings reveal that checkpoint kinases switch Polepsilon to an exonuclease-safe mode preventing nascent strand resection and stabilizing stalled replication forks. Elective partitioning suppression has implications for the diverse Polepsilon roles in genome integrity maintenance.

34107305	RAD51 facilitates replication fork reversal and protects reversed forks from nuclease degradation. Although potentially a useful replication stress response mechanism, unregulated fork reversal can cause genome instability. Here we show that RADX, a single-strand DNA binding protein that binds to and destabilizes RAD51 nucleofilaments, can either inhibit or promote fork reversal depending on replication stress levels. RADX inhibits fork reversal at elongating forks, thereby preventing fork slowing and collapse. Paradoxically, in the presence of persistent replication stress, RADX localizes to stalled forks to generate reversed fork structures. Consequently, inactivating RADX prevents fork-reversal-dependent telomere dysfunction in the absence of RTEL1 and blocks nascent strand degradation when fork protection factors are inactivated. Addition of RADX increases SMARCAL1-dependent fork reversal in conditions in which pre-binding RAD51 to a model fork substrate is inhibitory. Thus, RADX directly interacts with RAD51 and single-strand DNA to confine fork reversal to persistently stalled forks.	RADX prevents genome instability by confining replication fork reversal to stalled forks.	Molecular cell	1
34624217	Deregulation of oncogenic signals in cancer triggers replication stress. Immediate early genes (IEGs) are rapidly and transiently expressed following stressful signals, contributing to an integrated response. Here, we find that the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A1 localizes across the gene body and 3' UTR of IEGs, where it inhibits transcriptional elongation by RNA Pol II, generating R-loops and accessible chromatin domains. Acute replication stress causes immediate dissociation of NR4A1 and a burst of transcriptionally poised IEG expression. Ectopic expression of NR4A1 enhances tumorigenesis by breast cancer cells, while its deletion leads to massive chromosomal instability and proliferative failure, driven by deregulated expression of its IEG target, FOS. Approximately half of breast and other primary cancers exhibit accessible chromatin domains at IEG gene bodies, consistent with this stress-regulatory pathway. Cancers that have retained this mechanism in adapting to oncogenic replication stress may be dependent on NR4A1 for their proliferation.	NR4A1 regulates expression of immediate early genes, suppressing replication stress in cancer.	Molecular cell	1
32943576	Transcription factor SNAI2 plays key roles during development and has also been known to promote metastasis by inducing invasive phenotype and tumor-initiating activity of cancer cells. However, the post-translational regulation of SNAI2 is less well studied. We performed a dual-luciferase-based, genome-wide E3 ligase siRNA library screen and identified ASB13 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets SNAI2 for ubiquitination and degradation. ASB13 knockout in breast cancer cells promoted cell migration and decreased F-actin polymerization, while overexpression of ASB13 suppressed lung metastasis. Furthermore, ASB13 knockout decreased YAP expression, and such regulation is dependent on an increased protein level of SNAI2, which in turn represses YAP transcription. YAP suppresses tumor progression in breast cancer, as YAP knockout increases tumorsphere formation, anchorage-independent colony formation, cell migration in vitro, and lung metastasis in vivo. Clinical data analysis reveals that ASB13 expression is positively correlated with improved overall survival in breast cancer patients. These findings establish ASB13 as a suppressor of breast cancer metastasis by promoting degradation of SNAI2 and relieving its transcriptional repression of YAP.

32912902	The uptake of macromolecules and cellular debris through macropinocytosis has emerged as an important nutrient acquisition strategy of cancer cells. Genetic alterations commonly found in human cancers (e.g. mutations in KRAS or loss of PTEN) have been shown to increase macropinocytosis. To identify additional effectors that enable cell growth dependent on the uptake of extracellular proteins, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) cells were selected for growth in medium where extracellular albumin was the obligate source of the essential amino acid leucine. Analysis of global changes in chromatin availability and gene expression revealed that PDA cells selected under these conditions exhibited elevated activity of the transcriptional activators Yap/Taz. Knockout of Yap/Taz prevented growth of PDA cells in leucine-deficient medium, but not in complete medium. Furthermore, constitutively active forms of Yap or Taz were sufficient to stimulate macropinocytosis of extracellular protein. In addition to promoting the uptake of plasma proteins, Yap/Taz also promoted the scavenging of apoptotic cell bodies and necrotic debris by PDA cells. The Yap/Taz transcriptional target Axl was found to be essential for cell growth dependent on the uptake of dead cells and cell debris. Together, these studies suggest that the Hippo pathway effectors Yap and Taz are important transcriptional regulators of endocytic nutrient uptake.

32912901	Despite being the frontline therapy for type 2 diabetes, the mechanisms of action of the biguanide drug metformin are still being discovered. In particular, the detailed molecular interplays between the AMPK and the mTORC1 pathway in the hepatic benefits of metformin are still ill defined. Metformin-dependent activation of AMPK classically inhibits mTORC1 via TSC/RHEB, but several lines of evidence suggest additional mechanisms at play in metformin inhibition of mTORC1. Here we investigated the role of direct AMPK-mediated serine phosphorylation of RAPTOR in a new Raptor (AA) mouse model, in which AMPK phospho-serine sites Ser722 and Ser792 of RAPTOR were mutated to alanine. Metformin treatment of primary hepatocytes and intact murine liver requires AMPK regulation of both RAPTOR and TSC2 to fully inhibit mTORC1, and this regulation is critical for both the translational and transcriptional response to metformin. Transcriptionally, AMPK and mTORC1 were both important for regulation of anabolic metabolism and inflammatory programs triggered by metformin treatment. The hepatic transcriptional response in mice on high-fat diet treated with metformin was largely ablated by AMPK deficiency under the conditions examined, indicating the essential role of this kinase and its targets in metformin action in vivo.

Their enzymatic activities are stimulated by a regulatory protein Dnmt3L (Dnmt3-like) in vitro. However, genetic evidence indicates that Dnmt3L functions predominantly as a regulator of Dnmt3a in germ cells. How Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b activities are regulated during embryonic development and in somatic cells remains largely unknown. Here we show that Dnmt3b3, a catalytically inactive Dnmt3b isoform expressed in differentiated cells, positively regulates de novo methylation by Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b with a preference for Dnmt3b. Dnmt3b3 is equally potent as Dnmt3L in stimulating the activities of Dnmt3a2 and Dnmt3b2 in vitro. Like Dnmt3L, Dnmt3b3 forms a complex with Dnmt3a2 with a stoichiometry of 2:2. However, rescue experiments in Dnmt3a/3b/3l triple-knockout (TKO) mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) reveal that Dnmt3b3 prefers Dnmt3b2 over Dnmt3a2 in remethylating genomic sequences. Dnmt3a2, an active isoform that lacks the N-terminal uncharacterized region of Dnmt3a1 including a nuclear localization signal, has very low activity in TKO mESCs, indicating that an accessory protein is absolutely required for its function. Our results suggest that Dnmt3b3 and perhaps similar Dnmt3b isoforms facilitate de novo DNA methylation during embryonic development and in somatic cells.	The inactive Dnmt3b3 isoform preferentially enhances Dnmt3b-mediated DNA methylation.	Genes & development	0
33184221	Through recurrent bouts synchronous with the hair cycle, quiescent melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) become activated to generate proliferative progeny that differentiate into pigment-producing melanocytes. The signaling factors orchestrating these events remain incompletely understood. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing with comparative gene expression analysis to elucidate the transcriptional dynamics of McSCs through quiescence, activation, and melanocyte maturation. Unearthing converging signs of increased WNT and BMP signaling along this progression, we endeavored to understand how these pathways are integrated. Employing conditional lineage-specific genetic ablation studies in mice, we found that loss of BMP signaling in the lineage leads to hair graying due to a block in melanocyte maturation. We show that interestingly, BMP signaling functions downstream from activated McSCs and maintains WNT effector, transcription factor LEF1. Employing pseudotime analysis, genetics, and chromatin landscaping, we show that following WNT-mediated activation of McSCs, BMP and WNT pathways collaborate to trigger the commitment of proliferative progeny by fueling LEF1- and MITF-dependent differentiation. Our findings shed light upon the signaling interplay and timing of cues that orchestrate melanocyte lineage progression in the hair follicle and underscore a key role for BMP signaling in driving complete differentiation.

33888556	The conserved meiosis-specific kinetochore regulator, meikin (Moa1 in fission yeast) plays a central role in establishing meiosis-specific kinetochore function. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show how Moa1 regulates centromeric cohesion protection, a function that has been previously attributed to shugoshin (Sgo1). Moa1 is known to associate with Plo1 kinase. We explore Plo1-dependent Rec8 phosphorylation and identify a key phosphorylation site required for cohesion protection. The phosphorylation of Rec8 by Moa1-Plo1 potentiates the activity of PP2A associated with Sgo1. This leads to dephosphorylation of Rec8 at another site, which thereby prevents cleavage of Rec8 by separase.	Meikin synergizes with shugoshin to protect cohesin Rec8 during meiosis I.

33832988	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, noncoding RNAs that associate with Argonaute (AGO) to influence mRNA stability and translation, thereby regulating cellular determination and phenotype. While several individual miRNAs have been shown to control adipocyte function, including energy storage in white fat and energy dissipation in brown fat, a comprehensive analysis of miRNA activity in these tissues has not been performed. We used high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by cross-linking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) to comprehensively characterize the network of high-confidence, in vivo mRNA:miRNA interactions across white and brown fat, revealing >20,000 unique AGO binding sites. When coupled with miRNA and mRNA sequencing, we found an inverse correlation between depot-enriched miRNAs and their targets. To illustrate the functionality of our HITS-CLIP data set in identifying specific miRNA:mRNA interactions, we show that miR-29 is a novel regulator of leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone that coordinates food intake and energy homeostasis. Two independent miR-29 binding sites in the leptin 3' UTR were validated using luciferase assays, and miR-29 gain and loss of function modulated leptin mRNA and protein secretion in primary adipocytes. This work represents the only experimentally generated miRNA targetome in adipose tissue and identifies multiple regulatory pathways that may specify the unique identities of white and brown fat.

34140355	Kinesin-1 carries cargos including proteins, RNAs, vesicles, and pathogens over long distances within cells. The mechanochemical cycle of kinesins is well described, but how they establish cargo specificity is not fully understood. Transport of oskar mRNA to the posterior pole of the Drosophila oocyte is mediated by Drosophila kinesin-1, also called kinesin heavy chain (Khc), and a putative cargo adaptor, the atypical tropomyosin, aTm1. How the proteins cooperate in mRNA transport is unknown. Here, we present the high-resolution crystal structure of a Khc-aTm1 complex. The proteins form a tripartite coiled coil comprising two in-register Khc chains and one aTm1 chain, in antiparallel orientation. We show that aTm1 binds to an evolutionarily conserved cargo binding site on Khc, and mutational analysis confirms the importance of this interaction for mRNA transport in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Khc binds RNA directly and that it does so via its alternative cargo binding domain, which forms a positively charged joint surface with aTm1, as well as through its adjacent auxiliary microtubule binding domain. Finally, we show that aTm1 plays a stabilizing role in the interaction of Khc with RNA, which distinguishes aTm1 from classical motor adaptors.

32232464	Age-dependent oocyte aneuploidy, a major cause of Down syndrome, is associated with declining sister chromatid cohesion in postnatal oocytes. Here we show that cohesion in postnatal mouse oocytes is regulated by Tex19.1. We show Tex19.1-/- oocytes have defects maintaining chiasmata, missegregate their chromosomes during meiosis, and transmit aneuploidies to the next generation. Furthermore, we show that mouse Tex19.1 inhibits N-end rule protein degradation mediated by its interacting partner UBR2, and that Ubr2 itself has a previously undescribed role in negatively regulating the acetylated SMC3 subpopulation of cohesin in mitotic somatic cells. Lastly, we show that acetylated SMC3 is associated with meiotic chromosome axes in mouse oocytes, and that this population of cohesin is specifically depleted in the absence of Tex19.1. These findings indicate that Tex19.1 regulates UBR protein activity to maintain acetylated SMC3 and sister chromatid cohesion in postnatal oocytes and prevent aneuploidy from arising in the female germline.	Tex19.1 inhibits the N-end rule pathway and maintains acetylated SMC3 cohesin and sister chromatid cohesion in oocytes.	The Journal of cell biology	0
32207772	Accurate chromosome segregation demands efficient capture of microtubules by kinetochores and their conversion to stable bioriented attachments that can congress and then segregate chromosomes. An early event is the shedding of the outermost fibrous corona layer of the kinetochore following microtubule attachment. Centromere protein F (CENP-F) is part of the corona, contains two microtubule-binding domains, and physically associates with dynein motor regulators. Here, we have combined CRISPR gene editing and engineered separation-of-function mutants to define how CENP-F contributes to kinetochore function. We show that the two microtubule-binding domains make distinct contributions to attachment stability and force transduction but are dispensable for chromosome congression. We further identify a specialized domain that functions to limit the dynein-mediated stripping of corona cargoes through a direct interaction with Nde1. This antagonistic activity is crucial for maintaining the required corona composition and ensuring efficient kinetochore biorientation.	CENP-F stabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachments and limits dynein stripping of corona cargoes.	The Journal of cell biology	1
32580209	Mechanisms coupling the atypical PKC (aPKC) kinase activity to its subcellular localization are essential for cell polarization. Unlike other members of the PKC family, aPKC has no well-defined plasma membrane (PM) or calcium binding domains, leading to the assumption that its subcellular localization relies exclusively on protein-protein interactions. Here we show that in both Drosophila and mammalian cells, the pseudosubstrate region (PSr) of aPKC acts as a polybasic domain capable of targeting aPKC to the PM via electrostatic binding to PM PI4P and PI(4,5)P2. However, physical interaction between aPKC and Par-6 is required for the PM-targeting of aPKC, likely by allosterically exposing the PSr to bind PM. Binding of Par-6 also inhibits aPKC kinase activity, and such inhibition can be relieved through Par-6 interaction with apical polarity protein Crumbs. Our data suggest a potential mechanism in which allosteric regulation of polybasic PSr by Par-6 couples the control of both aPKC subcellular localization and spatial activation of its kinase activity.	A polybasic domain in aPKC mediates Par6-dependent control of membrane targeting and kinase activity.	The Journal of cell biology	1
32491151	The stress-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) controls microtubule dynamics by enhancing both microtubule growth and rescues. Here, we show that upon cell stress, JNK directly phosphorylates the microtubule rescue factor CLIP-170 in its microtubule-binding domain to increase its rescue-promoting activity. Phosphomimetic versions of CLIP-170 enhance its ability to promote rescue events in vitro and in cells. Furthermore, while phosphomimetic mutations do not alter CLIP-170's capability to form comets at growing microtubule ends, both phosphomimetic mutations and JNK activation increase the occurrence of CLIP-170 remnants on the microtubule lattice at the rear of comets. As the CLIP-170 remnants, which are potential sites of microtubule rescue, display a shorter lifetime when CLIP-170 is phosphorylated, we propose that instead of acting at the time of rescue occurrence, CLIP-170 would rather contribute in preparing the microtubule lattice for future rescues at these predetermined sites.	Stress-induced phosphorylation of CLIP-170 by JNK promotes microtubule rescue.	The Journal of cell biology	0
32662822	Lysosomes are degradation and signaling organelles that adapt their biogenesis to meet many different cellular demands; however, it is unknown how lysosomes change their numbers for cell division. Here, we report that the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4/6 regulate lysosome biogenesis during the cell cycle. Chemical or genetic inactivation of CDK4/6 increases lysosomal numbers by activating the lysosome and autophagy transcription factors TFEB and TFE3. CDK4/6 interact with and phosphorylate TFEB/TFE3 in the nucleus, thereby inactivating them by promoting their shuttling to the cytoplasm. During the cell cycle, lysosome numbers increase in S and G2/M phases when cyclin D turnover diminishes CDK4/6 activity. These findings not only uncover the molecular events that direct the nuclear export of TFEB/TFE3, but also suggest a mechanism that controls lysosome biogenesis in the cell cycle. CDK4/6 inhibitors promote autophagy and lysosome-dependent degradation, which has important implications for the therapy of cancer and lysosome-related disorders.

32597933	DNA replication is highly regulated by the ubiquitin system, which plays key roles upon stress. The ubiquitin-like modifier ISG15 (interferon-stimulated gene 15) is induced by interferons, bacterial and viral infection, and DNA damage, but it is also constitutively expressed in many types of cancer, although its role in tumorigenesis is still largely elusive. Here, we show that ISG15 localizes at the replication forks, in complex with PCNA and the nascent DNA, where it regulates DNA synthesis. Indeed, high levels of ISG15, intrinsic or induced by interferon-beta, accelerate DNA replication fork progression, resulting in extensive DNA damage and chromosomal aberrations. This effect is largely independent of ISG15 conjugation and relies on ISG15 functional interaction with the DNA helicase RECQ1, which promotes restart of stalled replication forks. Additionally, elevated ISG15 levels sensitize cells to cancer chemotherapeutic treatments. We propose that ISG15 up-regulation exposes cells to replication stress, impacting genome stability and response to genotoxic drugs.

32858747	Cancer is characterized by genomic instability leading to deletion or amplification of oncogenes or tumor suppressors. However, most of the altered regions are devoid of known cancer drivers. Here, we identify lncRNAs frequently lost or amplified in cancer. Among them, we found amplified lncRNA associated with lung cancer-1 (ALAL-1) as frequently amplified in lung adenocarcinomas. ALAL-1 is also overexpressed in additional tumor types, such as lung squamous carcinoma. The RNA product of ALAL-1 is able to promote the proliferation and tumorigenicity of lung cancer cells. ALAL-1 is a TNFalpha- and NF-kappaB-induced cytoplasmic lncRNA that specifically interacts with SART3, regulating the subcellular localization of the protein deubiquitinase USP4 and, in turn, its function in the cell. Interestingly, ALAL-1 expression inversely correlates with the immune infiltration of lung squamous tumors, while tumors with ALAL-1 amplification show lower infiltration of several types of immune cells. We have thus unveiled a pro-oncogenic lncRNA that mediates cancer immune evasion, pointing to a new target for immune potentiation.	Analysis of copy number alterations reveals the lncRNA ALAL-1 as a regulator of lung cancer immune evasion.	The Journal of cell biology	0
32931550	Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C (CPT1C) is a sensor of malonyl-CoA and is located in the ER of neurons. AMPA receptors (AMPARs) mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission in the brain and play a key role in synaptic plasticity. In the present study, we demonstrate across different metabolic stress conditions that modulate malonyl-CoA levels in cortical neurons that CPT1C regulates the trafficking of the major AMPAR subunit, GluA1, through the phosphatidyl-inositol-4-phosphate (PI(4)P) phosphatase SAC1. In normal conditions, CPT1C down-regulates SAC1 catalytic activity, allowing efficient GluA1 trafficking to the plasma membrane. However, under low malonyl-CoA levels, such as during glucose depletion, CPT1C-dependent inhibition of SAC1 is released, facilitating SAC1's translocation to ER-TGN contact sites to decrease TGN PI(4)P pools and trigger GluA1 retention at the TGN. Results reveal that GluA1 trafficking is regulated by CPT1C sensing of malonyl-CoA and provide the first report of a SAC1 inhibitor. Moreover, they shed light on how nutrients can affect synaptic function and cognition.	Sensing of nutrients by CPT1C controls SAC1 activity to regulate AMPA receptor trafficking.

32915949	The endoplasmic reticulum is a cellular hub of lipid metabolism, coordinating lipid synthesis with continuous changes in metabolic flux. Maintaining ER lipid homeostasis despite these fluctuations is crucial to cell function and viability. Here, we identify a novel mechanism that is crucial for normal ER lipid metabolism and protects the ER from dysfunction. We identify the molecular function of the evolutionarily conserved ER protein FIT2 as a fatty acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) diphosphatase that hydrolyzes fatty acyl-CoA to yield acyl 4'-phosphopantetheine. This activity of FIT2, which is predicted to be active in the ER lumen, is required in yeast and mammalian cells for maintaining ER structure, protecting against ER stress, and enabling normal lipid storage in lipid droplets. Our findings thus solve the long-standing mystery of the molecular function of FIT2 and highlight the maintenance of optimal fatty acyl-CoA levels as key to ER homeostasis.	FIT2 is an acyl-coenzyme A diphosphatase crucial for endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis.	The Journal of cell biology	1
32854114	Peroxisomal matrix proteins are imported into peroxisomes via membrane-bound docking/translocation machinery. One central component of this machinery is Pex14p, a peroxisomal membrane protein involved in the docking of Pex5p, the receptor for peroxisome targeting signal type 1 (PTS1). Studies in several yeast species have shown that Pex14p is phosphorylated in vivo, whereas no function has been assigned to Pex14p phosphorylation in yeast and mammalian cells. Here, we investigated peroxisomal protein import and its dynamics in mitotic mammalian cells. In mitotically arrested cells, Pex14p is phosphorylated at Ser-232, resulting in a lower import efficiency of catalase, but not the majority of proteins including canonical PTS1 proteins. Conformational change induced by the mitotic phosphorylation of Pex14p more likely increases homomeric interacting affinity and suppresses topological change of its N-terminal part, thereby giving rise to the retardation of Pex5p export in mitotic cells. Taken together, these data show that mitotic phosphorylation of Pex14p and consequent suppression of catalase import are a mechanism of protecting DNA upon nuclear envelope breakdown at mitosis.	Mitotic phosphorylation of Pex14p regulates peroxisomal import machinery.	The Journal of cell biology	0
32805026	In the mammalian cochlea, the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway aligns hair cell orientation along the plane of the sensory epithelium. Concurrently, multiple cell intrinsic planar polarity (referred to as iPCP) modules mediate planar polarization of the hair cell apical cytoskeleton, including the kinocilium and the V-shaped hair bundle essential for mechanotransduction. How PCP and iPCP are coordinated during development and the roles of Wnt ligands in this process remain unresolved. Here we show that genetic blockade of Wnt secretion in the cochlear epithelium resulted in a shortened cochlear duct and misoriented and misshapen hair bundles. Mechanistically, Wnts stimulate Gi activity by regulating the localization of Daple, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Galphai. In turn, the Gbetagamma complex signals through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) to regulate kinocilium positioning and asymmetric localizations of a subset of core PCP proteins, thereby coordinating PCP and iPCP. Thus, our results identify a putative Wnt/heterotrimeric G protein/PI3K pathway for PCP regulation.	Wnts regulate planar cell polarity via heterotrimeric G protein and PI3K signaling.

32841357	Natural killer (NK) cell-mediated killing involves the membrane fusion of preformed lytic granules. While the roles of actin and microtubules are well accepted during this process, the function of septins, another cytoskeletal component that associates with actin and microtubules, has not been investigated. Here we show that genetic depletion or pharmacologic stabilization of the septin cytoskeleton significantly inhibited NK cell cytotoxicity. Although the stabilization of septin filaments impaired conjugate formation, depletion of septin proteins had no impact on conjugate formation, lytic granule convergence, or MTOC polarization to the cytotoxic synapse (CS). Interestingly, septins copurify and accumulate near the polarized lytic granules at the CS, where they regulate lytic granule release. Mechanistically, we find that septin 7 interacts with the SNARE protein syntaxin 11 and facilitates its interaction with syntaxin binding protein 2 to promote lytic granule fusion. Altogether, our data identify a critical role for septins in regulating the release of lytic granule contents during NK cell-mediated killing.

33119040	Control of integrin activity is vital during development and tissue homeostasis, while derailment of integrin function contributes to pathophysiological processes. Phosphorylation of a conserved threonine motif (T788/T789) in the integrin beta cytoplasmic domain increases integrin activity. Here, we report that T788/T789 functions as a phospho-switch, which determines the association with either talin and kindlin-2, the major integrin activators, or filaminA, an integrin activity suppressor. A genetic screen identifies the phosphatase PPM1F as the critical enzyme, which selectively and directly dephosphorylates the T788/T789 motif. PPM1F-deficient cell lines show constitutive integrin phosphorylation, exaggerated talin binding, increased integrin activity, and enhanced cell adhesion. These gain-of-function phenotypes are reverted by reexpression of active PPM1F, but not a phosphatase-dead mutant. Disruption of the ppm1f gene in mice results in early embryonic death at day E10.5. Together, PPM1F controls the T788/T789 phospho-switch in the integrin beta1 cytoplasmic tail and constitutes a novel target to modulate integrin activity.

33090185	Dendrite pathology is frequently observed in various neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Although previous studies identified several pathogenic mediators of dendrite defects that act through loss of function in NDs, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here, our search for additional pathogenic contributors to dendrite defects in NDs identifies Relish/NF-kappaB as a novel gain-of-toxicity-based mediator of dendrite defects in animal models for polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In a Drosophila model for polyQ diseases, polyQ-induced dendrite defects require Dredd/Caspase-8-mediated endoproteolytic cleavage of Relish to generate the N-terminal fragment, Rel68, and subsequent Charon-mediated nuclear localization of Rel68. Rel68 alone induced neuronal toxicity causing dendrite and behavioral defects, and we identify two novel transcriptional targets, Tup and Pros, that mediate Rel68-induced neuronal toxicity. Finally, we show that Rel68-induced toxicity also contributes to dendrite and behavioral defects in a Drosophila model for ALS. Collectively, our data propose disinhibition of latent toxicity of Relish/NF-kappaB as a novel pathogenic mechanism underlying dendrite pathology in NDs.	NF-kappaB disinhibition contributes to dendrite defects in fly models of neurodegenerative diseases.	The Journal of cell biology	1
33044553	Kinesin-14s are conserved molecular motors required for high-fidelity chromosome segregation, but their specific contributions to spindle function have not been fully defined. Here, we show that key functions of budding yeast Kinesin-14 Cik1-Kar3 are accomplished in a complex with Bim1 (yeast EB1). Genetic complementation of mitotic phenotypes identifies a novel KLTF peptide motif in the Cik1 N-terminus. We show that this motif is one element of a tripartite binding interface required to form a high-affinity Bim1-Cik1-Kar3 complex. Lack of Bim1-binding by Cik1-Kar3 delays cells in mitosis and impairs microtubule bundle organization and dynamics. Conversely, constitutive targeting of Cik1-Kar3 to microtubule plus ends induces the formation of nuclear microtubule bundles. Cells lacking the Bim1-Cik1-Kar3 complex rely on the conserved microtubule bundler Ase1/PRC1 for metaphase spindle organization, and simultaneous loss of plus-end targeted Kar3 and Ase1 is lethal. Our results reveal the contributions of an EB1-Kinesin-14 complex for spindle formation as a prerequisite for efficient kinetochore clustering and bi-orientation.	The EB1-Kinesin-14 complex is required for efficient metaphase spindle assembly and kinetochore bi-orientation.	The Journal of cell biology	0
33351100	Centrosome duplication occurs under strict spatiotemporal regulation once per cell cycle, and it begins with cartwheel assembly and daughter centriole biogenesis at the lateral sites of the mother centrioles. However, although much of this process is understood, how centrosome duplication is initiated remains unclear. Here, we show that cartwheel assembly followed by daughter centriole biogenesis is initiated on the NEDD1-containing layer of the pericentriolar material (PCM) by the recruitment of SAS-6 to the mother centriole under the regulation of PLK4. We found that PLK4-mediated phosphorylation of NEDD1 at its S325 amino acid residue directly promotes both NEDD1 binding to SAS-6 and recruiting SAS-6 to the centrosome. Overexpression of phosphomimicking NEDD1 mutant S325E promoted cartwheel assembly and daughter centriole biogenesis initiations, whereas overexpression of nonphosphorylatable NEDD1 mutant S325A abolished the initiations. Collectively, our results demonstrate that PLK4-regulated NEDD1 facilitates initiation of the cartwheel assembly and of daughter centriole biogenesis in mammals.

33326013	Cells exposed to heat shock induce a conserved gene expression program, the heat shock response (HSR), encoding protein homeostasis (proteostasis) factors. Heat shock also triggers proteostasis factors to form subcellular quality control bodies, but the relationship between these spatial structures and the HSR is unclear. Here we show that localization of the J-protein Sis1, a cofactor for the chaperone Hsp70, controls HSR activation in yeast. Under nonstress conditions, Sis1 is concentrated in the nucleoplasm, where it promotes Hsp70 binding to the transcription factor Hsf1, repressing the HSR. Upon heat shock, Sis1 forms an interconnected network with other proteostasis factors that spans the nucleolus and the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. We propose that localization of Sis1 to this network directs Hsp70 activity away from Hsf1 in the nucleoplasm, leaving Hsf1 free to induce the HSR. In this manner, Sis1 couples HSR activation to the spatial organization of the proteostasis network.	Subcellular localization of the J-protein Sis1 regulates the heat shock response.

33284320	During G1 in budding yeast, the Cdc42 GTPase establishes a polar front, along which actin is recruited to direct secretion for bud formation. Cdc42 localizes at the bud cortex and then redistributes between mother and daughter in anaphase. The molecular mechanisms that terminate Cdc42 bud-localized activity during mitosis are poorly understood. We demonstrate that the activity of the Cdc14 phosphatase, released through the mitotic exit network, is required for Cdc42 redistribution between mother and bud. Induced Cdc14 nucleolar release results in premature Cdc42 redistribution between mother and bud. Inhibition of Cdc14 causes persistence of Cdc42 bud localization, which perturbs normal cell size and spindle positioning. Bem3, a Cdc42 GAP, binds Cdc14 and is dephosphorylated at late anaphase in a Cdc14-dependent manner. We propose that Cdc14 dephosphorylates and activates Bem3 to allow Cdc42 inactivation and redistribution. Our results uncover a mechanism through which Cdc14 regulates the spatiotemporal activity of Cdc42 to maintain normal cell size at cytokinesis.	The mitotic exit network regulates the spatiotemporal activity of Cdc42 to maintain cell size.	The Journal of cell biology	0
33258871	Primary cilia function as critical signaling hubs whose absence leads to severe disorders collectively known as ciliopathies; our knowledge of ciliogenesis remains limited. We show that Smo induces ciliogenesis through two distinct yet essential noncanonical Hh pathways in several cell types, including neurons. Surprisingly, ligand activation of Smo induces autophagy via an LKB1-AMPK axis to remove the satellite pool of OFD1. This is required, but not sufficient, for ciliogenesis. Additionally, Smo activates the Galphai-LGN-NuMA-dynein axis, causing accumulation of a portion of OFD1 at centrioles in early ciliogenesis. Both pathways are critical for redistribution of BBS4 from satellites to centrioles, which is also mediated by OFD1 centriolar translocation. Notably, different Smo agonists, which activate Smo distinctly, activate one or the other of these pathways; only in combination they recapitulate the activity of Hh ligand. These studies provide new insight into physiological stimuli (Hh) that activate autophagy and promote ciliogenesis and introduce a novel role for the Galphai-LGN-NuMA-dynein complex in this process.

33475699	Primary cilia protrude from the cell surface and have diverse roles during development and disease, which depends on the precise timing and control of cilia assembly and disassembly. Inactivation of assembly often causes cilia defects and underlies ciliopathy, while diseases caused by dysfunction in disassembly remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that CEP55 functions as a cilia disassembly regulator to participate in ciliopathy. Cep55-/- mice display clinical manifestations of Meckel-Gruber syndrome, including perinatal death, polycystic kidneys, and abnormalities in the CNS. Interestingly, Cep55-/- mice exhibit an abnormal elongation of cilia on these tissues. Mechanistically, CEP55 promotes cilia disassembly by interacting with and stabilizing Aurora A kinase, which is achieved through facilitating the chaperonin CCT complex to Aurora A. In addition, CEP55 mutation in Meckel-Gruber syndrome causes the failure of cilia disassembly. Thus, our study establishes a cilia disassembly role for CEP55 in vivo, coupling defects in cilia disassembly to ciliopathy and further suggesting that proper cilia dynamics are critical for mammalian development.

33464297	Adaptor protein complex 5 (AP-5) and its partners, SPG11 and SPG15, are recruited onto late endosomes and lysosomes. Here we show that recruitment of AP-5/SPG11/SPG15 is enhanced in starved cells and occurs by coincidence detection, requiring both phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) and Rag GTPases. PI3P binding is via the SPG15 FYVE domain, which, on its own, localizes to early endosomes. GDP-locked RagC promotes recruitment of AP-5/SPG11/SPG15, while GTP-locked RagA prevents its recruitment. Our results uncover an interplay between AP-5/SPG11/SPG15 and the mTORC1 pathway and help to explain the phenotype of AP-5/SPG11/SPG15 deficiency in patients, including the defect in autophagic lysosome reformation.

33382409	Meiosis creates genetic diversity by recombination and segregation of chromosomes. The synaptonemal complex assembles during meiotic prophase I and assists faithful exchanges between homologous chromosomes, but how its assembly/disassembly is regulated remains to be understood. Here, we report how two major posttranslational modifications, phosphorylation and ubiquitination, cooperate to promote synaptonemal complex assembly. We found that the ubiquitin ligase complex SCF is important for assembly and maintenance of the synaptonemal complex in Drosophila female meiosis. This function of SCF is mediated by two substrate-recognizing F-box proteins, Slmb/betaTrcp and Fbxo42. SCF-Fbxo42 down-regulates the phosphatase subunit PP2A-B56, which is important for synaptonemal complex assembly and maintenance.

33535228	NLRC4 inflammasome activation and the subsequent maturation of IL-1beta and IL-18 are critical for protection against infection by bacterial pathogens. The epigenetic regulator Brd4 has emerged as a key player in inflammation by regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines. However, whether Brd4 has any role in inflammasome activation remains undetermined. Here, we demonstrated that Brd4 is an important regulator of NLRC4 inflammasome activation in response to Salmonella typhimurium infection. Brd4-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) displayed impaired caspase-1 activation, ASC oligomerization, IL-1beta maturation, gasdermin-D cleavage, and pyroptosis in response to S.typhimurium infection. RNA sequencing and RT-PCR results revealed that the transcription of Naips was decreased in Brd4-deficient BMDMs. Brd4 formed a complex with IRF8/PU.1 and bound to the IRF8 and PU.1 binding motifs on the promoters of Naips to maintain the expression of Naips. Furthermore, myeloid lineage-specific Brd4 conditional knockout mice were more susceptible to S.typhimurium infection with increased mortality, bacterial loads, and tissue damage; impaired inflammasome-dependent cytokine production; and pyroptosis. Our studies identify a novel function of Brd4 in innate immunity by controlling inflammasome-mediated cytokine release and pyroptosis to effectively battle S.typhimurium infection.

33819341	"Although ectopic overexpression of miRNAs can influence mammary normal and cancer stem cells (SCs/CSCs), their physiological relevance remains uncertain. Here, we show that miR-146 is relevant for SC/CSC activity. MiR-146a/b expression is high in SCs/CSCs from human/mouse primary mammary tissues, correlates with the basal-like breast cancer subtype, which typically has a high CSC content, and specifically distinguishes cells with SC/CSC identity. Loss of miR-146 reduces SC/CSC self-renewal in vitro and compromises patient-derived xenograft tumor growth in vivo, decreasing the number of tumor-initiating cells, thus supporting its pro-oncogenic function. Transcriptional analysis in mammary SC-like cells revealed that miR-146 has pleiotropic effects, reducing adaptive response mechanisms and activating the exit from quiescent state, through a complex network of finely regulated miRNA targets related to quiescence, transcription, and one-carbon pool metabolism. Consistent with these findings, SCs/CSCs display innate resistance to anti-folate chemotherapies either in vitro or in vivo that can be reversed by miR-146 depletion, unmasking a ""hidden vulnerability"" exploitable for the development of anti-CSC therapies."	miR-146 connects stem cell identity with metabolism and pharmacological resistance in breast cancer.

33666644	A hallmark of aging is immunosenescence, a decline in immune functions, which appeared to be inevitable in living organisms, including Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we show that genetic inhibition of the DAF-2/insulin/IGF-1 receptor drastically enhances immunocompetence in old age in C. elegans. We demonstrate that longevity-promoting DAF-16/FOXO and heat-shock transcription factor 1 (HSF-1) increase immunocompetence in old daf-2(-) animals. In contrast, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (PMK-1), a key determinant of immunity, is only partially required for this rejuvenated immunity. The up-regulation of DAF-16/FOXO and HSF-1 decreases the expression of the zip-10/bZIP transcription factor, which in turn down-regulates INS-7, an agonistic insulin-like peptide, resulting in further reduction of insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS). Thus, reduced IIS prevents immune aging via the up-regulation of anti-aging transcription factors that modulate an endocrine insulin-like peptide through a feedforward mechanism. Because many functions of IIS are conserved across phyla, our study may lead to the development of strategies against immune aging in humans.	Reduced insulin/IGF1 signaling prevents immune aging via ZIP-10/bZIP-mediated feedforward loop.	The Journal of cell biology	1
33656555	The polarisome is a cortical proteinaceous microcompartment that organizes the growth of actin filaments and the fusion of secretory vesicles in yeasts and filamentous fungi. Polarisomes are compact, spotlike structures at the growing tips of their respective cells. The molecular forces that control the form and size of this microcompartment are not known. Here we identify a complex between the polarisome subunit Pea2 and the type V Myosin Myo2 that anchors Myo2 at the cortex of yeast cells. We discovered a point mutation in the cargo-binding domain of Myo2 that impairs the interaction with Pea2 and consequently the formation and focused localization of the polarisome. Cells carrying this mutation grow round instead of elongated buds. Further experiments and biophysical modeling suggest that the interactions between polarisome-bound Myo2 motors and dynamic actin filaments spatially focus the polarisome and sustain its compact shape.	Type V myosin focuses the polarisome and shapes the tip of yeast cells.	The Journal of cell biology	1
33929486	The T cell receptor (TCR) pathway receives, processes, and amplifies the signal from pathogenic antigens to the activation of T cells. Although major components in this pathway have been identified, the knowledge on how individual components cooperate to effectively transduce signals remains limited. Phase separation emerges as a biophysical principle in organizing signaling molecules into liquid-like condensates. Here, we report that phospholipase Cgamma1 (PLCgamma1) promotes phase separation of LAT, a key adaptor protein in the TCR pathway. PLCgamma1 directly cross-links LAT through its two SH2 domains. PLCgamma1 also protects LAT from dephosphorylation by the phosphatase CD45 and promotes LAT-dependent ERK activation and SLP76 phosphorylation. Intriguingly, a nonmonotonic effect of PLCgamma1 on LAT clustering was discovered. Computer simulations, based on patchy particles, revealed how the cluster size is regulated by protein compositions. Together, these results define a critical function of PLCgamma1 in promoting phase separation of the LAT complex and TCR signal transduction.

33914027	Activation of inflammation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an important innate immune response. Here we investigated the contribution of caspases to the LPS-mediated inflammatory response and discovered distinctive temporal roles of RIPK1 in mediating proinflammatory cytokine production when caspases are inhibited. We propose a biphasic model that differentiates the role of RIPK1 in early versus late phase. The early production of proinflammation cytokines stimulated by LPS with caspase inhibition is mediated by the NF-kappaB pathway that requires the scaffold function of RIPK1 but is kinase independent. Autocrine production of TNFalpha in the late phase promotes the formation of a novel TNFR1-associated complex with activated RIPK1, FADD, caspase-8, and key mediators of NF-kappaB signaling. The production of proinflammatory cytokines in the late phase can be blocked by RIPK1 kinase inhibitor Nec-1s. Our study demonstrates a mechanism by which the activation of RIPK1 promotes its own scaffold function to regulate the NF-kappaB-mediated proinflammatory cytokine production that is negatively regulated by caspases to restrain inflammatory signaling.	Caspase inhibition prolongs inflammation by promoting a signaling complex with activated RIPK1.	The Journal of cell biology	0
33836042	Mitotic entry involves inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A bound to its B55/Tws regulatory subunit (PP2A-B55/Tws), which dephosphorylates substrates of mitotic kinases. This inhibition is induced when Greatwall phosphorylates Endos, turning it into an inhibitor of PP2A-Tws. How this mechanism operates spatiotemporally in the cell is incompletely understood. We previously reported that the nuclear export of Greatwall in prophase promotes mitotic progression. Here, we examine the importance of the localized activities of PP2A-Tws and Endos for mitotic regulation. We find that Tws shuttles through the nucleus via a conserved nuclear localization signal (NLS), but expression of Tws in the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus rescues the development of tws mutants. Moreover, we show that Endos must be in the cytoplasm before nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) to be efficiently phosphorylated by Greatwall and to bind and inhibit PP2A-Tws. Disrupting the cytoplasmic function of Endos before NEBD results in subsequent mitotic defects. Evidence suggests that this spatiotemporal regulation is conserved in humans.	Spatiotemporal coordination of Greatwall-Endos-PP2A promotes mitotic progression.	The Journal of cell biology	0
34128958	Rab11 GTPase proteins are required for cytokinesis, ciliogenesis, and lumenogenesis. Rab11a is critical for apical delivery of podocalyxin (PODXL) during lumen formation in epithelial cells. SH3BP5 and SH3BP5L are guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rab11. We show that SH3BP5 and SH3BP5L are required for activation of Rab11a and cyst lumen formation. Using proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) interaction proteomics, we have identified SH3BP5 and its paralogue SH3BP5L as new substrates of the poly-ADP-ribose polymerase Tankyrase and the E3 ligase RNF146. We provide data demonstrating that epithelial polarity via cyst lumen formation is governed by Tankyrase, which inhibits Rab11a activation through the suppression of SH3BP5 and SH3BP5L. RNF146 reduces Tankyrase protein abundance and restores Rab11a activation and lumen formation. Thus, Rab11a activation is controlled by a signaling pathway composed of the sequential inhibition of SH3BP5 paralogues by Tankyrase, which is itself suppressed by RNF146.	Tankyrase regulates epithelial lumen formation via suppression of Rab11 GEFs.	The Journal of cell biology	0
33988678	Dynamic targeting of the ULK1 complex to the ER is crucial for initiating autophagosome formation and for subsequent formation of ER-isolation membrane (IM; autophagosomal precursor) contact during IM expansion. Little is known about how the ULK1 complex, which comprises FIP200, ULK1, ATG13, and ATG101 and does not exist as a constitutively coassembled complex, is recruited and stabilized on the ER. Here, we demonstrate that the ER-localized transmembrane proteins Atlastin 2 and 3 (ATL2/3) contribute to recruitment and stabilization of ULK1 and ATG101 at the FIP200-ATG13-specified autophagosome formation sites on the ER. In ATL2/3 KO cells, formation of FIP200 and ATG13 puncta is unaffected, while targeting of ULK1 and ATG101 is severely impaired. Consequently, IM initiation is compromised and slowed. ATL2/3 directly interact with ULK1 and ATG13 and facilitate the ATG13-mediated recruitment/stabilization of ULK1 and ATG101. ATL2/3 also participate in forming ER-IM tethering complexes. Our study provides insights into the dynamic assembly of the ULK1 complex on the ER for autophagosome formation.	Atlastin 2/3 regulate ER targeting of the ULK1 complex to initiate autophagy.

34137789	WDR62 is a microcephaly-related, microtubule (MT)-associated protein (MAP) that localizes to the spindle pole and regulates spindle organization, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that WDR62 regulates spindle dynamics by recruiting katanin to the spindle pole and further reveal a TPX2-Aurora A-WDR62-katanin axis in cells. By combining cellular and in vitro experiments, we demonstrate that WDR62 shows preference for curved segments of dynamic GDP-MTs, as well as GMPCPP- and paclitaxel-stabilized MTs, suggesting that it recognizes extended MT lattice. Consistent with this property, WDR62 alone is inefficient in recruiting katanin to GDP-MTs, while WDR62 complexed with TPX2/Aurora A can potently promote katanin-mediated severing of GDP-MTs in vitro. In addition, the MT-binding affinity of WDR62 is autoinhibited through JNK phosphorylation-induced intramolecular interaction. We propose that WDR62 is an atypical MAP and functions as an adaptor protein between its recruiting factor TPX2/Aurora A and the effector katanin to orchestrate the regulation of spindle dynamics.

34100862	Replication stress is one of the main sources of genome instability. Although the replication stress response in eukaryotic cells has been extensively studied, almost nothing is known about the replication stress response in nucleoli. Here, we demonstrate that initial replication stress-response factors, such as RPA, TOPBP1, and ATR, are recruited inside the nucleolus in response to drug-induced replication stress. The role of TOPBP1 goes beyond the typical replication stress response; it interacts with the low-complexity nucleolar protein Treacle (also referred to as TCOF1) and forms large Treacle-TOPBP1 foci inside the nucleolus. In response to replication stress, Treacle and TOPBP1 facilitate ATR signaling at stalled replication forks, reinforce ATR-mediated checkpoint activation inside the nucleolus, and promote the recruitment of downstream replication stress response proteins inside the nucleolus without forming nucleolar caps. Characterization of the Treacle-TOPBP1 interaction mode leads us to propose that these factors can form a molecular platform for efficient stress response in the nucleolus.	Treacle and TOPBP1 control replication stress response in the nucleolus.	The Journal of cell biology	0
34028500	The effectors of the Rab7 small GTPase play multiple roles in Rab7-dependent endosome-lysosome and autophagy-lysosome pathways. However, it is largely unknown how distinct Rab7 effectors coordinate to maintain the homeostasis of late endosomes and lysosomes to ensure appropriate endolysosomal and autolysosomal degradation. Here we report that WDR91, a Rab7 effector required for early-to-late endosome conversion, is essential for lysosome function and homeostasis. Mice lacking Wdr91 specifically in the central nervous system exhibited behavioral defects and marked neuronal loss in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. At the cellular level, WDR91 deficiency causes PtdIns3P-independent enlargement and dysfunction of lysosomes, leading to accumulation of autophagic cargoes in mouse neurons. WDR91 competes with the VPS41 subunit of the HOPS complex, another Rab7 effector, for binding to Rab7, thereby facilitating Rab7-dependent lysosome fusion in a controlled manner. WDR91 thus maintains an appropriate level of lysosome fusion to guard the normal function and survival of neurons.	The Rab7 effector WDR91 promotes autophagy-lysosome degradation in neurons by regulating lysosome fusion.	The Journal of cell biology	0
34347016	Cholesterol metabolism operates autonomously within the central nervous system (CNS), where the majority of cholesterol resides in myelin. We demonstrate that TDP-43, the pathological signature protein for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), influences cholesterol metabolism in oligodendrocytes. TDP-43 binds directly to mRNA of SREBF2, the master transcription regulator for cholesterol metabolism, and multiple mRNAs encoding proteins responsible for cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake, including HMGCR, HMGCS1, and LDLR. TDP-43 depletion leads to reduced SREBF2 and LDLR expression, and cholesterol levels in vitro and in vivo. TDP-43-mediated changes in cholesterol levels can be restored by reintroducing SREBF2 or LDLR. Additionally, cholesterol supplementation rescues demyelination caused by TDP-43 deletion. Furthermore, oligodendrocytes harboring TDP-43 pathology from FTD patients show reduced HMGCR and HMGCS1, and coaggregation of LDLR and TDP-43. Collectively, our results indicate that TDP-43 plays a role in cholesterol homeostasis in oligodendrocytes, and cholesterol dysmetabolism may be implicated in TDP-43 proteinopathies-related diseases.	TDP-43 mediates SREBF2-regulated gene expression required for oligodendrocyte myelination.	The Journal of cell biology	0
34287648	Glioblastoma is one of the most lethal forms of adult cancer, with a median survival of approximately 15 mo. Targeting glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) at the origin of tumor formation and relapse may prove beneficial. In situ, GSCs are nested within the vascular bed in tight interaction with brain endothelial cells, which positively control their expansion. Because GSCs are notably addicted to apelin (APLN), sourced from the surrounding endothelial stroma, the APLN/APLNR nexus has emerged as a druggable network. However, how this signaling axis operates in gliomagenesis remains underestimated. Here, we find that the glycoprotein GP130 interacts with APLNR at the plasma membrane of GSCs and arbitrates its availability at the surface via ELMOD1, which may further impact on ARF-mediated endovesicular trafficking. From a functional standpoint, interfering with GP130 thwarts APLNR-mediated self-renewal of GSCs ex vivo. Thus, GP130 emerges as an unexpected cicerone to the G protein-coupled APLN receptor, opening new therapeutic perspectives toward the targeting of cancer stem cells.	The glycoprotein GP130 governs the surface presentation of the G protein-coupled receptor APLNR.	The Journal of cell biology	1
34259806	ER-plasma membrane (PM) contacts are proposed to be held together by distinct families of tethering proteins, which in yeast include the VAP homologues Scs2/22, the extended-synaptotagmin homologues Tcb1/2/3, and the TMEM16 homologue Ist2. It is unclear whether these tethers act redundantly or whether individual tethers have specific functions at contacts. Here, we show that Ist2 directly recruits the phosphatidylserine (PS) transport proteins and ORP family members Osh6 and Osh7 to ER-PM contacts through a binding site located in Ist2's disordered C-terminal tethering region. This interaction is required for phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) production by the PS decarboxylase Psd2, whereby PS transported from the ER to the PM by Osh6/7 is endocytosed to the site of Psd2 in endosomes/Golgi/vacuoles. This role for Ist2 and Osh6/7 in nonvesicular PS transport is specific, as other tethers/transport proteins do not compensate. Thus, we identify a molecular link between the ORP and TMEM16 families and a role for endocytosis of PS in PE synthesis.	Ist2 recruits the lipid transporters Osh6/7 to ER-PM contacts to maintain phospholipid metabolism.	The Journal of cell biology	1
34431981	Depolarization drives neuronal plasticity. However, whether depolarization drives sensitization of peripheral nociceptive neurons remains elusive. By high-content screening (HCS) microscopy, we revealed that depolarization of cultured sensory neurons rapidly activates protein kinase A type II (PKA-II) in nociceptors by calcium influx through CaV1.2 channels. This effect was modulated by calpains but insensitive to inhibitors of cAMP formation, including opioids. In turn, PKA-II phosphorylated Ser1928 in the distal C terminus of CaV1.2, thereby increasing channel gating, whereas dephosphorylation of Ser1928 involved the phosphatase calcineurin. Patch-clamp and behavioral experiments confirmed that depolarization leads to calcium- and PKA-dependent sensitization of calcium currents ex vivo and local peripheral hyperalgesia in the skin in vivo. Our data suggest a local activity-driven feed-forward mechanism that selectively translates strong depolarization into further activity and thereby facilitates hypersensitivity of nociceptor terminals by a mechanism inaccessible to opioids.	Depolarization induces nociceptor sensitization by CaV1.2-mediated PKA-II activation.	The Journal of cell biology	0
34287617	Membrane traffic is an important regulator of cell migration through the endocytosis and recycling of cell surface receptors such as integrin heterodimers. Intracellular nanovesicles (INVs) are transport vesicles that are involved in multiple membrane trafficking steps, including the recycling pathway. The only known marker for INVs is tumor protein D54 (TPD54/TPD52L2), a member of the TPD52-like protein family. Overexpression of TPD52-like family proteins in cancer has been linked to poor prognosis and an aggressive metastatic phenotype, which suggests cell migration may be altered under these conditions. Here, we show that TPD54 directly binds membrane and associates with INVs via a conserved positively charged motif in its C terminus. We describe how other TPD52-like proteins are also associated with INVs, and we document the Rab GTPase complement of all INVs. Depletion of TPD52-like proteins inhibits cell migration and invasion, while their overexpression boosts motility. We show that inhibition of migration is likely due to altered recycling of alpha5beta1 integrins in INVs.	Intracellular nanovesicles mediate alpha5beta1 integrin trafficking during cell migration.

34550317	Skin regenerative capacity declines with age, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate a functional link between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and type XVII collagen (COL17A1) proteolysis on age-associated alteration of keratinocyte stem cell dynamics in skin regeneration. Live-imaging and computer simulation experiments predicted that human keratinocyte stem cell motility is coupled with self-renewal and epidermal regeneration. Receptor tyrosine kinase array identified the age-associated decline of EGFR signaling in mouse skin wound healing. Culture experiments proved that EGFR activation drives human keratinocyte stem cell motility with increase of COL17A1 by inhibiting its proteolysis through the secretion of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1). Intriguingly, COL17A1 directly regulated keratinocyte stem cell motility and collective cell migration by coordinating actin and keratin filament networks. We conclude that EGFR-COL17A1 axis-mediated keratinocyte stem cell motility drives epidermal regeneration, which provides a novel therapeutic approach for age-associated impaired skin regeneration.

32723862	The EAG (ether-a-go-go) family of voltage-gated K(+) channels are important regulators of neuronal and cardiac action potential firing (excitability) and have major roles in human diseases such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, cancer, and sudden cardiac death. A defining feature of EAG (Kv10-12) channels is a highly conserved domain on the N terminus, known as the eag domain, consisting of a Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domain capped by a short sequence containing an amphipathic helix (Cap domain). The PAS and Cap domains are both vital for the normal function of EAG channels. Using heme-affinity pulldown assays and proteomics of lysates from primary cortical neurons, we identified that an EAG channel, hERG3 (Kv11.3), binds to heme. In whole-cell electrophysiology experiments, we identified that heme inhibits hERG3 channel activity. In addition, we expressed the Cap and PAS domain of hERG3 in Escherichia coli and, using spectroscopy and kinetics, identified the PAS domain as the location for heme binding. The results identify heme as a regulator of hERG3 channel activity. These observations are discussed in the context of the emerging role for heme as a regulator of ion channel activity in cells.

32759307	MicroRNAs have been recently shown to be important regulators of lipid metabolism. However, the mechanisms of microRNA-mediated regulation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) biosynthesis in vertebrates remain largely unknown. Herein, we for the first time addressed the role of miR-26a in LC-PUFA biosynthesis in the marine rabbitfish Siganus canaliculatus The results showed that miR-26a was significantly down-regulated in liver of rabbitfish reared in brackish water and in S. canaliculatus hepatocyte line (SCHL) incubated with the LC-PUFA precursor alpha-linolenic acid, suggesting that miR-26a may be involved in LC-PUFA biosynthesis because of its abundance being regulated by factors affecting LC-PUFA biosynthesis. Opposite patterns were observed in the expression of liver X receptor alpha (lxralpha) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (srebp1), as well as the LC-PUFA biosynthesis-related genes (Delta4 fads2, Delta6Delta5 fads2, and elovl5) in SCHL cells incubated with alpha-linolenic acid. Luciferase reporter assays revealed rabbitfish lxralpha as a target of miR-26a, and overexpression of miR-26a in SCHL cells markedly reduced protein levels of Lxralpha, Srebp1, and Delta6Delta5 Fads2 induced by the agonist T0901317. Moreover, increasing endogenous Lxralpha by knockdown of miR-26a facilitated Srebp1 activation and concomitant increased expression of genes involved in LC-PUFA biosynthesis and consequently promoted LC-PUFA biosynthesis both in vitro and in vivo These results indicate a critical role of miR-26a in regulating LC-PUFA biosynthesis through targeting the Lxralpha-Srebp1 pathway and provide new insights into the regulatory network controlling LC-PUFA biosynthesis and accumulation in vertebrates.	miR-26a mediates LC-PUFA biosynthesis by targeting the Lxralpha-Srebp1 pathway in the marine teleost Siganus canaliculatus.

32709750	Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a critical role in the coevolution of breast tumor cells and their microenvironment by modifying cellular compartments and regulating cancer cell functions via stromal-epithelial dialogue. However, the relationship and interaction between stromal and epithelial cells is still poorly understood. Herein, we revealed that breast cancer cells have a stronger ability to activate fibroblasts and transform them into myofibroblasts (CAF-like) than normal breast epithelial cells, and this stronger ability occurs through paracrine signaling. In turn, myofibroblasts promote the proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and stemness of breast cancer cells. Detailed regulatory mechanisms showed that, compared with normal cells, Survivin is overexpressed in breast cancer cells and secreted extracellularly in the form of exosomes, which are then internalized by fibroblasts. Breast cancer cell-derived survivin up-regulates SOD1 expression in fibroblasts and then converts them into myofibroblasts, conversely inducing breast cancer progression in vitro and in vivo Thus, our results indicate that survivin acts as an activator of the tumor microenvironment and that SOD1 up-regulation in fibroblasts can promote breast cancer progression. These results suggest that targeting survivin and SOD1 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for breast cancer.	Survivin in breast cancer-derived exosomes activates fibroblasts by up-regulating SOD1, whose feedback promotes cancer proliferation and metastasis.	The Journal of biological chemistry	1
32753481	The multifaceted adaptor protein beta-arr1 (beta-arrestin1) promotes activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) by the chemokine receptor CXCR4, facilitating chemotaxis. This function of beta-arr1 requires the assistance of the adaptor protein STAM1 (signal-transducing adaptor molecule 1) because disruption of the interaction between STAM1 and beta-arr1 reduces CXCR4-mediated activation of FAK and chemotaxis. To begin to understand the mechanism by which beta-arr1 together with STAM1 activates FAK, we used site-directed spin-labeling EPR spectroscopy-based studies coupled with bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based cellular studies to show that STAM1 is recruited to activated beta-arr1 by binding to a novel surface on beta-arr1 at the base of the finger loop, at a site that is distinct from the receptor-binding site. Expression of a STAM1-deficient binding beta-arr1 mutant that is still able to bind to CXCR4 significantly reduced CXCL12-induced activation of FAK but had no impact on ERK-1/2 activation. We provide evidence of a novel surface at the base of the finger loop that dictates non-GPCR interactions specifying beta-arrestin-dependent signaling by a GPCR. This surface might represent a previously unidentified switch region that engages with effector molecules to drive beta-arrestin signaling.

32605923	Autophagy has been shown to maintain neural system homeostasis during stroke. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal autophagy in ischemic stroke remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the pathway consisting of MEG3 (maternally expressed gene 3), microRNA-378 (miR-378), and GRB2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2) in neuronal autophagy and neurological functional impairment in ischemic stroke. A mouse model of the middle cerebral artery occluded-induced ischemic stroke and an in vitro model of oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced neuronal injury were developed. To understand the role of the MEG3/miR-378/GRB2 axis in the neuronal regulation, the expression of proteins associated with autophagy in neurons was measured by Western blotting analysis, and neuron death was evaluated using a lactate dehydrogenase leakage rate test. First, it was found that the GRB2 gene, up-regulated in middle cerebral artery occluded-operated mice and oxygen-glucose deprivation-exposed neurons, was a target gene of miR-378. Next, miR-378 inhibited neuronal loss and neurological functional impairment in mice, as well as neuronal autophagy and neuronal death by silencing of GRB2. Confirmatory in vitro experiments showed that MEG3 could specifically bind to miR-378 and subsequently up-regulate the expression of GRB2, which in turn suppressed the activation of Akt/mTOR pathway. Taken together, these findings suggested that miR-378 might protect against neuronal autophagy and neurological functional impairment and proposed that a MEG3/miR-378/GRB2 regulatory axis contributed to better understanding of the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke.

32843478	Cyclosporin A (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK506) are valuable immunosuppressants for a range of clinical settings, including (but not limited to) organ transplantation and the treatment of autoimmune diseases. They function by inhibiting the activity of the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin toward nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NF-AT) in T-lymphocytes. However, use of CsA is associated with more serious side effects and worse clinical outcomes than FK506. Here we show that CsA, but not FK506, causes activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), an event which is normally an acute reaction to various types of intracellular insults, such as nutrient deficiency or endoplasmic reticulum stress. These effects of CsA involve at least two of the stress-activated protein kinases (GCN2 and PERK) that act on the translational machinery to slow down protein synthesis via phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2alpha and thereby induce the ISR. These actions of CsA likely contribute to the adverse effects associated with its clinical application.	Cyclosporin A but not FK506 activates the integrated stress response in human cells.

32868454	Muscle atrophy is regulated by the balance between protein degradation and synthesis. FOXO1, a transcription factor, helps to determine this balance by activating pro-atrophic gene transcription when present in muscle fiber nuclei. Foxo1 nuclear efflux is promoted by AKT-mediated Foxo1 phosphorylation, eliminating FOXO1's atrophy-promoting effect. AKT activation can be promoted by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) or insulin via a pathway including IGF1 or insulin, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and AKT. We used confocal fluorescence time-lapse imaging of FOXO1-GFP in adult isolated living muscle fibers maintained in culture to explore the effects of IGF1 and insulin on FOXO1-GFP nuclear efflux with and without pharmacological inhibitors. We observed that although AKT inhibitor blocks the IGF1- or insulin-induced effect on FOXO1 nuclear efflux, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors, which we show to be effective in these fibers, do not. We also found that inhibition of the protein kinase ACK1 or ATM contributes to the suppression of FOXO1 nuclear efflux after IGF1. These results indicate a novel pathway that has been unexplored in the IGF1- or insulin-induced regulation of FOXO1 and present information useful both for therapeutic interventions for muscle atrophy and for further investigative areas into insulin insensitivity and type 2 diabetes.

32958558	Palmitoylation, the modification of proteins with the lipid palmitate, is a key regulator of protein targeting and trafficking. However, knowledge of the roles of specific palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs), which catalyze palmitoylation, is incomplete. For example, little is known about which PATs are present in neuronal axons, although long-distance trafficking of palmitoyl-proteins is important for axon integrity and for axon-to-soma retrograde signaling, a process critical for axon development and for responses to injury. Identifying axonally targeted PATs might thus provide insights into multiple aspects of axonal biology. We therefore comprehensively determined the subcellular distribution of mammalian PATs in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and, strikingly, found that only two PATs, ZDHHC5 and ZDHHC8, were enriched in DRG axons. Signals via the Gp130/JAK/STAT3 and DLK/JNK pathways are important for axonal injury responses, and we found that ZDHHC5 and ZDHHC8 were required for Gp130/JAK/STAT3, but not DLK/JNK, axon-to-soma signaling. ZDHHC5 and ZDHHC8 robustly palmitoylated Gp130 in cotransfected nonneuronal cells, supporting the possibility that Gp130 is a direct ZDHHC5/8 substrate. In DRG neurons, Zdhhc5/8 shRNA knockdown reduced Gp130 palmitoylation and even more markedly reduced Gp130 surface expression, potentially explaining the importance of these PATs for Gp130-dependent signaling. Together, these findings provide new insights into the subcellular distribution and roles of specific PATs and reveal a novel mechanism by which palmitoylation controls axonal retrograde signaling.	The palmitoyl acyltransferases ZDHHC5 and ZDHHC8 are uniquely present in DRG axons and control retrograde signaling via the Gp130/JAK/STAT3 pathway.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0
32873710	Recent proteomics studies of vertebrate striated muscle have identified lysine acetylation at several sites on actin. Acetylation is a reversible post-translational modification that neutralizes lysine's positive charge. Positively charged residues on actin, particularly Lys(326) and Lys(328), are predicted to form critical electrostatic interactions with tropomyosin (Tpm) that promote its binding to filamentous (F)-actin and bias Tpm to an azimuthal location where it impedes myosin attachment. The troponin (Tn) complex also influences Tpm's position along F-actin as a function of Ca(2+) to regulate exposure of myosin-binding sites and, thus, myosin cross-bridge recruitment and force production. Interestingly, Lys(326) and Lys(328) are among the documented acetylated residues. Using an acetic anhydride-based labeling approach, we showed that excessive, nonspecific actin acetylation did not disrupt characteristic F-actin-Tpm binding. However, it significantly reduced Tpm-mediated inhibition of myosin attachment, as reflected by increased F-actin-Tpm motility that persisted in the presence of Tn and submaximal Ca(2+) Furthermore, decreasing the extent of chemical acetylation, to presumptively target highly reactive Lys(326) and Lys(328), also resulted in less inhibited F-actin-Tpm, implying that modifying only these residues influences Tpm's location and, potentially, thin filament regulation. To unequivocally determine the residue-specific consequences of acetylation on Tn-Tpm-based regulation of actomyosin activity, we assessed the effects of K326Q and K328Q acetyl (Ac)-mimetic actin on Ca(2+)-dependent, in vitro motility parameters of reconstituted thin filaments (RTFs). Incorporation of K328Q actin significantly enhanced Ca(2+) sensitivity of RTF activation relative to control. Together, our findings suggest that actin acetylation, especially Lys(328), modulates muscle contraction via disrupting inhibitory Tpm positioning.

32917726	The TMC genes encode a set of homologous transmembrane proteins whose functions are not well understood. Biallelic mutations in either TMC6 or TMC8 are detected in more than half of cases of the pre-malignant skin disease epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV). It is controversial whether EV induced by mutations in TMC6 or TMC8 originates from keratinocyte or lymphocyte defects. Quantification of TMC6 and TMC8 RNA levels in various organs revealed that lymphoid tissues have the highest levels of expression of both genes, and custom antibodies confirmed protein expression in mouse lymphocytes. To study the function of these proteins we generated mice with targeted deletion mutant alleles of Tmc6 or Tmc8 Either TMC6 or TMC8 deficiency induced a reduction in apparent molecular weight and/or amount of the other TMC molecule. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that TMC6 and TMC8 formed a protein complex in mouse and human T cells. MS and biochemical analysis demonstrated that TMC6 and TMC8 additionally interacted with the CIB1 protein to form TMC6-TMC8-CIB1 trimers. We demonstrated that TMC6 and TMC8 regulated CIB1 levels by protecting CIB1 from ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Reciprocally, CIB1 was needed for stabilizing TMC6 and TMC8 levels. These results suggest why inactivating mutations in any of the three human genes leads to similar clinical presentations. We also demonstrated that TMC6 and TMC8 levels are drastically lower and the proteins are less active in regulating CIB1 in keratinocytes than in T cells. Our study suggests that defects in lymphocytes may contribute to the etiology and pathogenesis of EV.	Expression of a TMC6-TMC8-CIB1 heterotrimeric complex in lymphocytes is regulated by each of the components.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0
32943552	The incidence of diabetes, obesity, and metabolic diseases has reached an epidemic status worldwide. Insulin resistance is a common link in the development of these conditions, and hyperinsulinemia is a central hallmark of peripheral insulin resistance. However, how hyperinsulinemia leads to systemic insulin resistance is less clear. We now provide evidence that hyperinsulinemia promotes the release of soluble pro-inflammatory mediators from macrophages that lead to systemic insulin resistance. Our observations suggest that hyperinsulinemia induces sirtuin1 (SIRT1) repression and stimulates NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation and transactivation of NF-kappaB to promote the extracellular release of pro-inflammatory mediators. We further showed that low-dose naltrexone (LDN) abrogates hyperinsulinemia-mediated SIRT1 repression and prevents NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation. This, in turn, attenuates the hyperinsulinemia-induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reinstates insulin sensitivity both in in vitro and in vivo diet-induced hyperinsulinemic mouse model. Notably, our data indicate that Sirt1 knockdown or inhibition blunts the anti-inflammatory properties of LDN in vitro Using numerous complementary in silico and in vitro experimental approaches, we demonstrated that LDN can bind to SIRT1 and increase its deacetylase activity. Together, these data support a critical role of SIRT1 in inflammation and insulin resistance in hyperinsulinemia. LDN improves hyperinsulinemia-induced insulin resistance by reorienting macrophages toward anti-inflammation. Thus, LDN treatment may provide a novel therapeutic approach against hyperinsulinemia-associated insulin resistance.	Low-dose naltrexone rescues inflammation and insulin resistance associated with hyperinsulinemia.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0
32978259	The actin cytoskeleton is of profound importance to cell shape, division, and intracellular force generation. Profilins bind to globular (G-)actin and regulate actin filament formation. Although profilins are well-established actin regulators, the distinct roles of the dominant profilin, profilin 1 (PFN1), versus the less abundant profilin 2 (PFN2) remain enigmatic. In this study, we use interaction proteomics to discover that PFN2 is an interaction partner of the actin N-terminal acetyltransferase NAA80, and further confirm this by analytical ultracentrifugation. Enzyme assays with NAA80 and different profilins demonstrate that PFN2 binding specifically increases the intrinsic catalytic activity of NAA80. NAA80 binds PFN2 through a proline-rich loop, deletion of which abrogates PFN2 binding. Small-angle X-ray scattering shows that NAA80, actin, and PFN2 form a ternary complex and that NAA80 has partly disordered regions in the N-terminus and the proline-rich loop, the latter of which is partly ordered upon PFN2 binding. Furthermore, binding of PFN2 to NAA80 via the proline-rich loop promotes binding between the globular domains of actin and NAA80, and thus acetylation of actin. However, the majority of cellular NAA80 is stably bound to PFN2 and not to actin, and we propose that this complex acetylates G-actin before it is incorporated into filaments. In conclusion, we reveal a functionally specific role of PFN2 as a stable interactor and regulator of the actin N-terminal acetyltransferase NAA80, and establish the modus operandi for NAA80-mediated actin N-terminal acetylation, a modification with a major impact on cytoskeletal dynamics.	PFN2 and NAA80 cooperate to efficiently acetylate the N-terminus of actin.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0
32948655	Phospholipase Cepsilon (PLCepsilon) is activated downstream of G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases through direct interactions with small GTPases, including Rap1A and Ras. Although Ras has been reported to allosterically activate the lipase, it is not known whether Rap1A has the same ability or what its molecular mechanism might be. Rap1A activates PLCepsilon in response to the stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors, translocating the complex to the perinuclear membrane. Because the C-terminal Ras association (RA2) domain of PLCepsilon was proposed to the primary binding site for Rap1A, we first confirmed using purified proteins that the RA2 domain is indeed essential for activation by Rap1A. However, we also showed that the PLCepsilon pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and first two EF hands (EF1/2) are required for Rap1A activation and identified hydrophobic residues on the surface of the RA2 domain that are also necessary. Small-angle X-ray scattering showed that Rap1A binding induces and stabilizes discrete conformational states in PLCepsilon variants that can be activated by the GTPase. These data, together with the recent structure of a catalytically active fragment of PLCepsilon, provide the first evidence that Rap1A, and by extension Ras, allosterically activate the lipase by promoting and stabilizing interactions between the RA2 domain and the PLCepsilon core.

33051205	Heme oxygenase-2 (HO2) and -1 (HO1) catalyze heme degradation to biliverdin, CO, and iron, forming an essential link in the heme metabolism network. Tight regulation of the cellular levels and catalytic activities of HO1 and HO2 is important for maintaining heme homeostasis. HO1 expression is transcriptionally regulated; however, HO2 expression is constitutive. How the cellular levels and activity of HO2 are regulated remains unclear. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of post-translational regulation of cellular HO2 levels by heme. We find that, under heme-deficient conditions, HO2 is destabilized and targeted for degradation, suggesting that heme plays a direct role in HO2 regulation. HO2 has three heme binding sites: one at its catalytic site and the others at its two heme regulatory motifs (HRMs). We report that, in contrast to other HRM-containing proteins, the cellular protein level and degradation rate of HO2 are independent of heme binding to the HRMs. Rather, under heme deficiency, loss of heme binding to the catalytic site destabilizes HO2. Consistently, an HO2 catalytic site variant that is unable to bind heme exhibits a constant low protein level and an enhanced protein degradation rate compared with the WT HO2. Finally, HO2 is degraded by the lysosome through chaperone-mediated autophagy, distinct from other HRM-containing proteins and HO1, which are degraded by the proteasome. These results reveal a novel aspect of HO2 regulation and deepen our understanding of HO2's role in maintaining heme homeostasis, paving the way for future investigation into HO2's pathophysiological role in heme deficiency response.

33454009	Hdac3 is a lysine deacetylase that removes acetyl groups from histones and additional proteins. Although Hdac3 functions within mesenchymal lineage skeletal cells are defined, little is known about Hdac3 activities in bone-resorbing osteoclasts. In this study we conditionally deleted Hdac3 within Ctsk-expressing cells and examined the effects on bone modeling and osteoclast differentiation in mice. Hdac3 deficiency reduced femur and tibia periosteal circumference and increased cortical periosteal osteoclast number. Trabecular bone was likewise reduced and was accompanied by increased osteoclast number per trabecular bone surface. We previously showed that Hdac3 deacetylates the p65 subunit of the NF-kappaB transcriptional complex to decrease DNA-binding and transcriptional activity. Hdac3-deficient osteoclasts demonstrate increased K310 NF-kappaB acetylation and NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. Hdac3-deficient osteoclast lineage cells were hyper-responsive to RANKL and showed elevated ex vivo osteoclast number and size and enhanced bone resorption in pit formation assays. Osteoclast-directed Hdac3 deficiency decreased cortical and trabecular bone mass parameters, suggesting that Hdac3 regulates coupling of bone resorption and bone formation. We surveyed a panel of osteoclast-derived coupling factors and found that Hdac3 suppression diminished sphingosine-1-phosphate production. Osteoclast-derived sphingosine-1-phosphate acts in paracrine to promote bone mineralization. Mineralization of WT bone marrow stromal cells cultured with conditioned medium from Hdac3-deficient osteoclasts was markedly reduced. Expression of alkaline phosphatase, type 1a1 collagen, and osteocalcin was also suppressed, but no change in Runx2 expression was observed. Our results demonstrate that Hdac3 controls bone modeling by suppressing osteoclast lineage cell responsiveness to RANKL and coupling to bone formation.

33454003	Thoracic great vessels such as the aorta and subclavian arteries are formed through dynamic remodeling of embryonic pharyngeal arch arteries (PAAs). Previous work has shown that loss of a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Hey1 in mice causes abnormal fourth PAA development and lethal great vessel anomalies resembling congenital malformations in humans. However, how Hey1 mediates vascular formation remains unclear. In this study, we revealed that Hey1 in vascular endothelial cells, but not in smooth muscle cells, played essential roles for PAA development and great vessel morphogenesis in mouse embryos. Tek-Cre-mediated Hey1 deletion in endothelial cells affected endothelial tube formation and smooth muscle differentiation in embryonic fourth PAAs and resulted in interruption of the aortic arch and other great vessel malformations. Cell specificity and signal responsiveness of Hey1 expression were controlled through multiple cis-regulatory regions. We found two distal genomic regions that had enhancer activity in endothelial cells and in the pharyngeal epithelium and somites, respectively. The novel endothelial enhancer was conserved across species and was specific to large-caliber arteries. Its transcriptional activity was regulated by Notch signaling in vitro and in vivo, but not by ALK1 signaling and other transcription factors implicated in endothelial cell specificity. The distal endothelial enhancer was not essential for basal Hey1 expression in mouse embryos but may likely serve for Notch-dependent transcriptional control in endothelial cells together with the proximal regulatory region. These findings help in understanding the significance and regulation of endothelial Hey1 as a mediator of multiple signaling pathways in embryonic vascular formation.

33122196	The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged to a pandemic and caused global public health crisis. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) was identified as the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. As a carboxypeptidase, ACE2 cleaves many biological substrates besides angiotensin II to control vasodilatation and vascular permeability. Given the nanomolar high affinity between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we investigated how this interaction would affect the enzymatic activity of ACE2. Surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein increased ACE2 proteolytic activity approximately 3-10 fold against model peptide substrates, such as caspase-1 substrate and Bradykinin-analog. The enhancement in ACE2 enzymatic function was mediated by the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD domain. These results highlighted the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection to enhance ACE2 activity, which may be relevant to the cardiovascular symptoms associated with COVID-19.	High affinity binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein enhances ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity.	The Journal of biological chemistry	1
33115754	Postoperative recurrence from microscopic residual disease must be prevented to cure intractable cancers, including pancreatic cancer. Key to this goal is the elimination of cancer stem cells (CSCs) endowed with tumor-initiating capacity and drug resistance. However, current therapeutic strategies capable of accomplishing this are insufficient. Using in vitro models of CSCs and in vivo models of tumor initiation in which CSCs give rise to xenograft tumors, we show that dexamethasone induces expression of MKP-1, a MAPK phosphatase, via glucocorticoid receptor activation, thereby inactivating JNK, which is required for self-renewal and tumor initiation by pancreatic CSCs as well as for their expression of survivin, an anti-apoptotic protein implicated in multidrug resistance. We also demonstrate that systemic administration of clinically relevant doses of dexamethasone together with gemcitabine prevents tumor formation by CSCs in a pancreatic cancer xenograft model. Our study thus provides preclinical evidence for the efficacy of dexamethasone as an adjuvant therapy to prevent postoperative recurrence in patients with pancreatic cancer.

33109614	Peptidoglycan (PG) is an essential constituent of the bacterial cell wall. During cell division, the machinery responsible for PG synthesis localizes mid-cell, at the septum, under the control of a multiprotein complex called the divisome. In Escherichia coli, septal PG synthesis and cell constriction rely on the accumulation of FtsN at the division site. Interestingly, a short sequence of FtsN (Leu(75)-Gln(93), known as (E)FtsN) was shown to be essential and sufficient for its functioning in vivo, but what exactly this sequence is doing remained unknown. Here, we show that (E)FtsN binds specifically to the major PG synthase PBP1b and is sufficient to stimulate its biosynthetic glycosyltransferase (GTase) activity. We also report the crystal structure of PBP1b in complex with (E)FtsN, which demonstrates that (E)FtsN binds at the junction between the GTase and UB2H domains of PBP1b. Interestingly, mutations to two residues (R141A/R397A) within the (E)FtsN-binding pocket reduced the activation of PBP1b by FtsN but not by the lipoprotein LpoB. This mutant was unable to rescue the DeltaponB-ponA (ts) strain, which lacks PBP1b and has a thermosensitive PBP1a, at nonpermissive temperature and induced a mild cell-chaining phenotype and cell lysis. Altogether, the results show that (E)FtsN interacts with PBP1b and that this interaction plays a role in the activation of its GTase activity by FtsN, which may contribute to the overall septal PG synthesis and regulation during cell division.	The bacterial cell division protein fragment (E)FtsN binds to and activates the major peptidoglycan synthase PBP1b.	The Journal of biological chemistry	1
33097593	Bone morphogenetic protein-9 (BMP-9) is a circulating cytokine that is known to play an essential role in the endothelial homeostasis and the binding of BMP-9 to the receptor activin-like kinase 1 (ALK-1) promotes endothelial cell quiescence. Previously, using an unbiased screen, we identified ALK-1 as a high-capacity receptor for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in endothelial cells that mediates its transcytosis in a nondegradative manner. Here we examine the crosstalk between BMP-9 and LDL and how it influences their interactions with ALK-1. Treatment of endothelial cells with BMP-9 triggers the extensive endocytosis of ALK-1, and it is mediated by caveolin-1 (CAV-1) and dynamin-2 (DNM2) but not clathrin heavy chain. Knockdown of CAV-1 reduces BMP-9-mediated internalization of ALK-1, BMP-9-dependent signaling and gene expression. Similarly, treatment of endothelial cells with LDL reduces BMP-9-induced SMAD1/5 phosphorylation and gene expression and silencing of CAV-1 and DNM2 diminishes LDL-mediated ALK-1 internalization. Interestingly, BMP-9-mediated ALK-1 internalization strongly re-duces LDL transcytosis to levels seen with ALK-1 deficiency. Thus, BMP-9 levels can control cell surface levels of ALK-1, via CAV-1, to regulate both BMP-9 signaling and LDL transcytosis.	BMP-9 and LDL crosstalk regulates ALK-1 endocytosis and LDL transcytosis in endothelial cells.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0
33093178	NSun2 is an RNA methyltransferase introducing 5-methylcytosine into tRNAs, mRNAs, and noncoding RNAs, thereby influencing the levels or function of these RNAs. Autotaxin (ATX) is a secreted glycoprotein and is recognized as a key factor in converting lysophosphatidylcholine into lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). The ATX-LPA axis exerts multiple biological effects in cell survival, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Here, we show that NSun2 is involved in the regulation of cell migration through methylating ATX mRNA. In the human glioma cell line U87, knockdown of NSun2 decreased ATX protein levels, whereas overexpression of NSun2 elevated ATX protein levels. However, neither overexpression nor knockdown of NSun2 altered ATX mRNA levels. Further studies revealed that NSun2 methylated the 3'-UTR of ATX mRNA at cytosine 2756 in vitro and in vivo Methylation by NSun2 enhanced ATX mRNA translation. In addition, NSun2-mediated 5-methylcytosine methylation promoted the export of ATX mRNA from nucleus to cytoplasm in an ALYREF-dependent manner. Knockdown of NSun2 suppressed the migration of U87 cells, which was rescued by the addition of LPA. In summary, we identify NSun2-mediated methylation of ATX mRNA as a novel mechanism in the regulation of ATX.	NSun2 promotes cell migration through methylating autotaxin mRNA.

33093176	The QT interval is a recording of cardiac electrical activity. Previous genome-wide association studies identified genetic variants that modify the QT interval upstream of LITAF (lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor), a protein encoding a regulator of endosomal trafficking. However, it was not clear how LITAF might impact cardiac excitation. We investigated the effect of LITAF on the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.5, which is critical for cardiac depolarization. We show that overexpressed LITAF resulted in a significant increase in the density of Nav1.5-generated voltage-gated sodium current I Na and Nav1.5 surface protein levels in rabbit cardiomyocytes and in HEK cells stably expressing Nav1.5. Proximity ligation assays showed co-localization of endogenous LITAF and Nav1.5 in cardiomyocytes, whereas co-immunoprecipitations confirmed they are in the same complex when overexpressed in HEK cells. In vitro data suggest that LITAF interacts with the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4-2, a regulator of Nav1.5. LITAF overexpression down-regulated NEDD4-2 in cardiomyocytes and HEK cells. In HEK cells, LITAF increased ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of co-expressed NEDD4-2 and significantly blunted the negative effect of NEDD4-2 on I Na We conclude that LITAF controls cardiac excitability by promoting degradation of NEDD4-2, which is essential for removal of surface Nav1.5. LITAF-knockout zebrafish showed increased variation in and a nonsignificant 15% prolongation of action potential duration. Computer simulations using a rabbit-cardiomyocyte model demonstrated that changes in Ca(2+) and Na(+) homeostasis are responsible for the surprisingly modest action potential duration shortening. These computational data thus corroborate findings from several genome-wide association studies that associated LITAF with QT interval variation.

33087447	IQGAP1 is a key scaffold protein that regulates numerous cellular processes and signaling pathways. Analogous to many other cellular proteins, IQGAP1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation. Nevertheless, very little is known about the specific sites of phosphorylation or the effects on IQGAP1 function. Here, using several approaches, including MS, site-directed mutagenesis, siRNA-mediated gene silencing, and chemical inhibitors, we identified the specific tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated on IQGAP1 and evaluated the effect on function. Tyr-172, Tyr-654, Tyr-855, and Tyr-1510 were phosphorylated on IQGAP1 when phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity was inhibited in cells. IQGAP1 was phosphorylated exclusively on Tyr-1510 under conditions with enhanced MET or c-Src signaling, including in human lung cancer cell lines. This phosphorylation was significantly reduced by chemical inhibitors of MET or c-Src or by siRNA-mediated knockdown of MET. To investigate the biological sequelae of phosphorylation, we generated a nonphosphorylatable IQGAP1 construct by replacing Tyr-1510 with alanine. The ability of hepatocyte growth factor, the ligand for MET, to promote AKT activation and cell migration was significantly greater when IQGAP1-null cells were reconstituted with IQGAP1 Y1510A than when cells were reconstituted with WT IQGAP1. Collectively, our data suggest that phosphorylation of Tyr-1510 of IQGAP1 alters cell function. Because increased MET signaling is implicated in the development and progression of several types of carcinoma, IQGAP1 may be a potential therapeutic target in selected malignancies.

33028632	The molecular mechanisms of reduced frataxin (FXN) expression in Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) are linked to epigenetic modification of the FXN locus caused by the disease-associated GAA expansion. Here, we identify that SUV4-20 histone methyltransferases, specifically SUV4-20 H1, play an important role in the regulation of FXN expression and represent a novel therapeutic target. Using a human FXN-GAA-Luciferase repeat expansion genomic DNA reporter model of FRDA, we screened the Structural Genomics Consortium epigenetic probe collection. We found that pharmacological inhibition of the SUV4-20 methyltransferases by the tool compound A-196 increased the expression of FXN by approximately 1.5-fold in the reporter cell line. In several FRDA cell lines and patient-derived primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells, A-196 increased FXN expression by up to 2-fold, an effect not seen in WT cells. SUV4-20 inhibition was accompanied by a reduction in H4K20me2 and H4K20me3 and an increase in H4K20me1, but only modest (1.4-7.8%) perturbation in genome-wide expression was observed. Finally, based on the structural activity relationship and crystal structure of A-196, novel small molecule A-196 analogs were synthesized and shown to give a 20-fold increase in potency for increasing FXN expression. Overall, our results suggest that histone methylation is important in the regulation of FXN expression and highlight SUV4-20 H1 as a potential novel therapeutic target for FRDA.	Inhibition of the SUV4-20 H1 histone methyltransferase increases frataxin expression in Friedreich's ataxia patient cells.	The Journal of biological chemistry	1
34015330	The glycoprotein alpha-dystroglycan helps to link the intracellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. A unique glycan structure attached to this protein is required for its interaction with extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin. Up to now, this is the only mammalian glycan known to contain ribitol phosphate groups. Enzymes in the Golgi apparatus use CDP-ribitol to incorporate ribitol phosphate into the glycan chain of alpha-dystroglycan. Since CDP-ribitol is synthesized in the cytoplasm, we hypothesized that an unknown transporter must be required for its import into the Golgi apparatus. We discovered that CDP-ribitol transport relies on the CMP-sialic acid transporter SLC35A1 and the transporter SLC35A4 in a redundant manner. These two transporters are closely related, but bulky residues in the predicted binding pocket of SLC35A4 limit its size. We hypothesized that the large binding pocket SLC35A1 might accommodate the bulky CMP-sialic acid and the smaller CDP-ribitol, whereas SLC35A4 might only accept CDP-ribitol. To test this, we expressed SLC35A1 with mutations in its binding pocket in SLC35A1 KO cell lines. When we restricted the binding site of SLC35A1 by introducing the bulky residues present in SLC35A4, the mutant transporter was unable to support sialylation of proteins in cells but still supported ribitol phosphorylation. This demonstrates that the size of the binding pocket determines the substrate specificity of SLC35A1, allowing a variety of cytosine nucleotide conjugates to be transported. The redundancy with SLC35A4 also explains why patients with SLC35A1 mutations do not show symptoms of alpha-dystroglycan deficiency.	The promiscuous binding pocket of SLC35A1 ensures redundant transport of CDP-ribitol to the Golgi.	The Journal of biological chemistry	1
33933451	Peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) folds and trafficks inefficiently, with only 20% of newly expressed protein trafficking to the cell surface. This behavior is exacerbated in many of the mutants associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, motivating further study. Here we characterized the role of N-glycosylation in limiting PMP22 trafficking. We first eliminated N-glycosylation using an N41Q mutation, which resulted in an almost 3-fold increase in trafficking efficiency of wildtype (WT) PMP22 and a 10-fold increase for the severely unstable L16P disease mutant in HEK293 cells, with similar results in Schwann cells. Total cellular levels were also much higher for the WT/N41Q mutant, although not for the L16P/N41Q form. Depletion of oligosaccharyltransferase OST-A and OST-B subunits revealed that WT PMP22 is N-glycosylated posttranslationally by OST-B, whereas L16P is cotranslationally glycosylated by OST-A. Quantitative proteomic screens revealed similarities and differences in the interactome for WT, glycosylation-deficient, and unstable mutant forms of PMP22 and also suggested that L16P is sequestered at earlier stages of endoplasmic reticulum quality control. CRISPR knockout studies revealed a role for retention in endoplasmic reticulum sorting receptor 1 (RER1) in limiting the trafficking of all three forms, for UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1 (UGGT1) in limiting the trafficking of WT and L16P but not N41Q, and calnexin (CNX) in limiting the trafficking of WT and N41Q but not L16P. This work shows that N-glycosylation is a limiting factor to forward trafficking PMP22 and sheds light on the proteins involved in its quality control.	Glycosylation limits forward trafficking of the tetraspan membrane protein PMP22.	The Journal of biological chemistry	1
33930462	"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), pathological forms of tau are transferred from cell to cell and ""seed"" aggregation of cytoplasmic tau. Phosphorylation of tau plays a key role in neurodegenerative tauopathies. In addition, apolipoprotein E (apoE), a major component of lipoproteins in the brain, is a genetic risk determinant for AD. The identification of the apoE receptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), as an endocytic receptor for tau raises several questions about the role of LRP1 in tauopathies: is internalized tau, like other LRP1 ligands, delivered to lysosomes for degradation, and does LRP1 internalize pathological tau leading to cytosolic seeding? We found that LRP1 rapidly internalizes (125)I-labeled tau, which is then efficiently degraded in lysosomal compartments. Surface plasmon resonance experiments confirm high affinity binding of tau and the tau microtubule-binding domain to LRP1. Interestingly, phosphorylated forms of recombinant tau bind weakly to LRP1 and are less efficiently internalized by LRP1. LRP1-mediated uptake of tau is inhibited by apoE, with the apoE4 isoform being the most potent inhibitor, likely because of its higher affinity for LRP1. Employing post-translationally-modified tau derived from brain lysates of human AD brain tissue, we found that LRP1-expressing cells, but not LRP1-deficient cells, promote cytosolic tau seeding in a process enhanced by apoE. These studies identify LRP1 as an endocytic receptor that binds and processes monomeric forms of tau leading to its degradation and promotes seeding by pathological forms of tau. The balance of these processes may be fundamental to the spread of neuropathology across the brain in AD."	Regulation of tau internalization, degradation, and seeding by LRP1 reveals multiple pathways for tau catabolism.	The Journal of biological chemistry	1
33930461	RAS effectors specifically interact with GTP-bound RAS proteins to link extracellular signals to downstream signaling pathways. These interactions rely on two types of domains, called RAS-binding (RB) and RAS association (RA) domains, which share common structural characteristics. Although the molecular nature of RAS-effector interactions is well-studied for some proteins, most of the RA/RB-domain-containing proteins remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we searched through human proteome databases, extracting 41 RA domains in 39 proteins and 16 RB domains in 14 proteins, each of which can specifically select at least one of the 25 members in the RAS family. We next comprehensively investigated the sequence-structure-function relationship between different representatives of the RAS family, including HRAS, RRAS, RALA, RAP1B, RAP2A, RHEB1, and RIT1, with all members of RA domain family proteins (RASSFs) and the RB-domain-containing CRAF. The binding affinity for RAS-effector interactions, determined using fluorescence polarization, broadly ranged between high (0.3 muM) and very low (500 muM) affinities, raising interesting questions about the consequence of these variable binding affinities in the regulation of signaling events. Sequence and structural alignments pointed to two interaction hotspots in the RA/RB domains, consisting of an average of 19 RAS-binding residues. Moreover, we found novel interactions between RRAS1, RIT1, and RALA and RASSF7, RASSF9, and RASSF1, respectively, which were systematically explored in sequence-structure-property relationship analysis, and validated by mutational analysis. These data provide a set of distinct functional properties and putative biological roles that should now be investigated in the cellular context.

33915127	The retinal insulin receptor (IR) exhibits basal kinase activity equivalent to that of the liver of fed animals, but unlike the liver, does not fluctuate with feeding and fasting; it also declines rapidly after the onset of insulin-deficient diabetes. The ligand(s) that determine basal IR activity in the retina has not been identified. Using a highly sensitive insulin assay, we found that retinal insulin concentrations remain constant in fed versus fasted rats and in diabetic versus control rats; vitreous fluid insulin levels were undetectable. Neutralizing antibodies against insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2), but not insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) or insulin, decreased IR kinase activity in normal rat retinas, and depletion of IGF-2 from serum specifically reduced IR phosphorylation in retinal cells. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that IGF-2 induced greater phosphorylation of the retinal IR than the IGF-1 receptor. Retinal IGF-2 mRNA content was 10-fold higher in adults than pups and orders of magnitude higher than in liver. Diabetes reduced retinal IGF-2, but not IGF-1 or IR, mRNA levels, and reduced IGF-2 and IGF-1 content in vitreous fluid. Finally, intravitreal administration of IGF-2 (mature and pro-forms) increased retinal IR and Akt kinase activity in diabetic rats. Collectively, these data reveal that IGF-2 is the primary ligand that defines basal retinal IR activity and suggest that reduced ocular IGF-2 may contribute to reduced IR activity in response to diabetes.

33894201	Speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) is a ubiquitin ligase adaptor that binds substrate proteins and facilitates their proteasomal degradation. Most SPOP substrates present multiple SPOP-binding (SB) motifs and undergo liquid-liquid phase separation with SPOP. Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1), an insulin transcription factor, is downregulated by interaction with SPOP. Unlike other substrates, only one SB motif has previously been reported within the Pdx1 C-terminal intrinsically disordered region (Pdx1-C). Given this difference, we aimed to determine the specific mode of interaction of Pdx1 with SPOP and how it is similar or different to that of other SPOP substrates. Here, we identify a second SB motif in Pdx1-C, but still find that the resulting moderate valency is insufficient to support phase separation with SPOP in cells. Although Pdx1 does not phase separate with SPOP, Pdx1 and SPOP interaction prompts SPOP relocalization from nuclear speckles to the diffuse nucleoplasm. Accordingly, we find that SPOP-mediated ubiquitination activity of Pdx1 occurs in the nucleoplasm and that highly efficient Pdx1 turnover requires both SB motifs. Our results suggest that the subnuclear localization of SPOP-substrate interactions and substrate ubiquitination may be directed by the properties of the substrate itself.	Intrinsically disordered substrates dictate SPOP subnuclear localization and ubiquitination activity.	The Journal of biological chemistry	1
33887325	Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a devastating pathogen in the swine industry worldwide. miRNAs are reported to be involved in virus-host interaction. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing and miRNA inhibitors to screen possible miRNAs that can inhibit PRRSV infection on its target cell, porcine alveolar macrophages. We observed that miR-218 was downregulated upon virus infection, and knockdown of miR-218 significantly enhanced PRRSV replication. Overexpression of miR-218 resulted in a decrease in PRRSV replication, and this overexpression did not alter viral genomic RNA levels, but rather increased antiviral interferon signaling. Further analysis revealed that miR-218 regulated PRRSV replication by directly targeting porcine suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), a JAK2 kinase inhibitor. Knockdown of the endogenous SOCS3 expression led to augmentation of type I interferon genes and resulted in decreased PRRSV replication, and vice versa. During PRRSV infection in vivo and in vitro, cellular miR-218 expression was downregulated and SOCS3 expression was upregulated, further supporting the inverse correlation between miR-218 and SOCS3 expression. The data on SOCS3 depletion in combination with miR-218 inhibition suggested that the antiviral activity of miR-218 required the SOCS3-mediated signaling pathway. Similarly, miR-218 negatively regulated PRRSV replication in Marc-145 cells, as well as the replication of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus in Vero and ST cells respectively. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PRRSV-induced miR-218 downregulation serves to inhibit the type I interferon response and may provide a novel therapeutic target for treatment of PRRSV and other viral infections.	Downregulation of miR-218 by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus facilitates viral replication via inhibition of type I interferon responses.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0
33865858	Escherichia coli RseP, a member of the site-2 protease family of intramembrane proteases, is involved in the activation of the sigma(E) extracytoplasmic stress response and elimination of signal peptides from the cytoplasmic membrane. However, whether RseP has additional cellular functions is unclear. In this study, we used mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic analysis to search for new substrates that might reveal unknown physiological roles for RseP. Our data showed that the levels of several Fec system proteins encoded by the fecABCDE operon (fec operon) were significantly decreased in an RseP-deficient strain. The Fec system is responsible for the uptake of ferric citrate, and the transcription of the fec operon is controlled by FecI, an alternative sigma factor, and its regulator FecR, a single-pass transmembrane protein. Assays with a fec operon expression reporter demonstrated that the proteolytic activity of RseP is essential for the ferric citrate-dependent upregulation of the fec operon. Analysis using the FecR protein and FecR-derived model proteins showed that FecR undergoes sequential processing at the membrane and that RseP participates in the last step of this sequential processing to generate the N-terminal cytoplasmic fragment of FecR that participates in the transcription of the fec operon with FecI. A shortened FecR construct was not dependent on RseP for activation, confirming this cleavage step is the essential and sufficient role of RseP. Our study unveiled that E. coli RseP performs the intramembrane proteolysis of FecR, a novel physiological role that is essential for regulating iron uptake by the ferric citrate transport system.	The Escherichia coli S2P intramembrane protease RseP regulates ferric citrate uptake by cleaving the sigma factor regulator FecR.	The Journal of biological chemistry	1
33853759	Cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) detachment is known to decrease extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, an intracellular pathway that is central for control of cell behavior. How cell-ECM detachment is linked to downregulation of ERK signaling, however, is incompletely understood. We show here that focal adhesion protein Ras Suppressor 1 (RSU1) plays a critical role in cell-ECM detachment induced suppression of ERK signaling. We have identified prohibitin 2 (PHB2), a component of membrane lipid rafts, as a novel binding protein of RSU1, and mapped a major RSU1-binding site to PHB2 amino acids 150 to 206 in the C-terminal region of the PHB/SPFH (stomatin/prohibitin/flotillin/HflKC) domain. The PHB2 binding is mediated by multiple sites located in the N-terminal leucine-rich repeat region of RSU1. Depletion of PHB2 suppressed cell-ECM adhesion-induced ERK activation. Furthermore, cell-ECM detachment increased RSU1 association with membrane lipid rafts and interaction with PHB2. Finally, knockout of RSU1 or inhibition of RSU1 interaction with PHB2 by overexpression of the major RSU1-binding PHB2 fragment (amino acids 150-206) effectively suppressed the cell-ECM detachment induced downregulation of ERK signaling. Additionally, expression of venus-tagged wild-type RSU1 restored ERK signaling, while expression of venus-tagged PHB2-binding defective RSU1 mutant in which the N-terminal leucine-rich repeat region is deleted did not. Taken together, Our findings identify a novel RSU1-PHB2 signaling axis that senses cell-ECM detachment and links it to decreased ERK signaling.

33839152	Exposure of mucosal epithelial cells to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein gp120 is known to disrupt epithelial cell junctions by impairing stathmin-mediated microtubule depolymerization. However, the pathological significance of this process and its underlying molecular mechanism remain unclear. Here we show that treatment of epithelial cells with pseudotyped HIV-1 viral particles or recombinant gp120 protein results in the activation of protein kinase G 1 (PKG1). Examination of epithelial cells by immunofluorescence microscopy reveals that PKG1 activation mediates the epithelial barrier damage upon HIV-1 exposure. Immunoprecipitation experiments show that PKG1 interacts with stathmin and phosphorylates stathmin at serine 63 in the presence of gp120. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence microscopy further demonstrate that PKG1-mediated phosphorylation of stathmin promotes its autophagic degradation by enhancing the interaction between stathmin and the autophagy adaptor protein p62. Collectively, these results suggest that HIV-1 exposure exploits the PKG1/stathmin axis to affect the microtubule cytoskeleton and thereby perturbs epithelial cell junctions. Our findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism by which exposure to HIV-1 increases epithelial permeability, which has implications for the development of effective strategies to prevent mucosal HIV-1 transmission.

33789160	The membrane phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are synthesized de novo by the CDP-choline and CDP-ethanolamine (Kennedy) pathway, in which the extracellular substrates choline and ethanolamine are transported into the cell, phosphorylated, and coupled with diacylglycerol to form the final phospholipid product. Although multiple transport systems have been established for choline, ethanolamine transport is poorly characterized and there is no single protein assigned a transport function for ethanolamine. The solute carriers 44A (SLC44A) known as choline transporter-like proteins-1 and -2 (CTL1 and CTL2) are choline transporter at the plasma membrane and mitochondria. We report a novel function of CTL1 and CTL2 in ethanolamine transport. Using the lack or the gain of gene function in combination with specific antibodies and transport inhibitors we established two distinct ethanolamine transport systems of a high affinity, mediated by CTL1, and of a low affinity, mediated by CTL2. Both transporters are Na(+)-independent ethanolamine/H(+) antiporters. Primary human fibroblasts with separate frameshift mutations in the CTL1 gene (M1= SLC44A1(DeltaAsp517) and M2= SLC44A1(DeltaSer126)) are devoid of CTL1 ethanolamine transport but maintain unaffected CTL2 transport. The lack of CTL1 in M2 cells reduced the ethanolamine transport, the flux through the CDP-ethanolamine Kennedy pathway, and PE synthesis. In contrast, overexpression of CTL1 in M2 cells improved ethanolamine transport and PE synthesis. These data firmly establish that CTL1 and CTL2 are the first identified ethanolamine transporters in whole cells and mitochondria, with intrinsic roles in de novo PE synthesis by the Kennedy pathway and intracellular redistribution of ethanolamine.	Choline transporter-like proteins 1 and 2 are newly identified plasma membrane and mitochondrial ethanolamine transporters.	The Journal of biological chemistry	1
33775697	Dysregulation of the developmentally important Notch signaling pathway is implicated in several types of cancer, including breast cancer. However, the specific roles and regulation of the four different Notch receptors have remained elusive. We have previously reported that the oncogenic PIM kinases phosphorylate Notch1 and Notch3. Phosphorylation of Notch1 within the second nuclear localization sequence of its intracellular domain (ICD) enhances its transcriptional activity and tumorigenicity. In this study, we analyzed Notch3 phosphorylation and its functional impact. Unexpectedly, we observed that the PIM target sites are not conserved between Notch1 and Notch3. Notch3 ICD (N3ICD) is phosphorylated within a domain, which is essential for formation of a transcriptionally active complex with the DNA-binding protein CSL. Through molecular modeling, X-ray crystallography, and isothermal titration calorimetry, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of N3ICD sterically hinders its interaction with CSL and thereby inhibits its CSL-dependent transcriptional activity. Surprisingly however, phosphorylated N3ICD still maintains tumorigenic potential in breast cancer cells under estrogenic conditions, which support PIM expression. Taken together, our data indicate that PIM kinases modulate the signaling output of different Notch paralogs by targeting distinct protein domains and thereby promote breast cancer tumorigenesis via both CSL-dependent and CSL-independent mechanisms.	PIM-induced phosphorylation of Notch3 promotes breast cancer tumorigenicity in a CSL-independent fashion.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0
33745968	The phosphatase cell division cycle 25B (Cdc25B) regulates cell cycle progression. Increased Cdc25B levels are often detected in cancer cell lines and human cancers and have been implicated in contributing to tumor growth, potentially by providing cancer cells with the ability to bypass checkpoint controls. However, the specific mechanism by which increased Cdc25B impacts tumor progression is not clear. Here we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and found that patients with high CDC25B expression had the expected poor survival. However, we also found that high CDC25B expression had a p53-dependent tumor suppressive effect in lung cancer and possibly several other cancer types. Looking in more detail at the tumor suppressive function of Cdc25B, we found that increased Cdc25B expression caused inhibition of cell growth in human normal fibroblasts. This effect was not due to alteration of specific cell cycle stage or inhibition of apoptosis, nor by induction of the DNA damage response. Instead, increased CDC25B expression led cells into senescence. We also found that p53 was required to induce senescence, which might explain the p53-dependent tumor suppressive function of Cdc25B. Mechanistically, we found that the Cdc25B phosphatase activity was required to induce senescence. Further analysis also found that Cdc25B stabilized p53 through binding and dephosphorylating p53. Together, this study identified a tumor-suppressive function of Cdc25B that is mediated through a p53-dependent senescence pathway.	CDC25B induces cellular senescence and correlates with tumor suppression in a p53-dependent manner.	The Journal of biological chemistry	1
33741341	N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is among the most abundant mRNA modifications, particularly in eukaryotes, and is found in mammals, plants, and even some viruses. Although essential for the regulation of many biological processes, the exact role of m(6)A modification in virus-host interaction remains largely unknown. Here, using m(6)A -immunoprecipitation and sequencing, we find that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection decreases the m(6)A modification of transcriptional factor KLF4 mRNA and subsequently increases its protein level. Mechanistically, EBV immediate-early protein BZLF1 interacts with the promoter of m(6)A methyltransferase METTL3, inhibiting its expression. Subsequently, the decrease of METTL3 reduces the level of KLF4 mRNA m(6)A modification, preventing its decay by the m(6)A reader protein YTHDF2. As a result, KLF4 protein level is upregulated and, in turn, promotes EBV infection of nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. Thus, our results suggest the existence of a positive feedback loop formed between EBV and host molecules via cellular mRNA m(6)A levels, and this feedback loop acts to facilitate viral infection. This mechanism contains multiple potential targets for controlling viral infectious diseases.

33639170	TRAF3 has diverse signaling functions, which vary by cell type. Uniquely in B lymphocytes, TRAF3 inhibits homeostatic survival. Highlighting the role of TRAF3 as a tumor suppressor, loss-of-function TRAF3 mutations are associated with human B-cell malignancies, while B-cell-specific deletion of TRAF3 in mice leads to autoimmunity and lymphoma development. The role of TRAF3 in inhibiting noncanonical NF-kappaB activation, CD40 and BAFF-R signaling to B cells is well documented. In contrast, TRAF3 enhances many T-cell effector functions, through associating with and enhancing signaling by the T-cell receptor (TCR)-CD28 complex. The present study was designed to determine the role of TRAF3 in signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR). The BCR is crucial for antigen recognition, survival, proliferation, and antibody production, and defects in BCR signaling can promote abnormal survival of malignant B cells. Here, we show that TRAF3 is associated with both CD79B and the BCR-activated kinases Syk and Btk following BCR stimulation. BCR-induced phosphorylation of Syk and additional downstream kinases was increased in TRAF3(-/-) B cells, with regulation observed in both follicular and marginal zone B-cell subsets. BCR stimulation of TRAF3(-/-) B cells resulted in increased surface expression of MHC-II, CD80, and CD86 molecules. Interestingly, increased survival of TRAF3(-/-) primary B cells was resistant to inhibition of Btk, while TRAF3-deficient malignant B-cell lines showed enhanced sensitivity. TRAF3 serves to restrain normal and malignant BCR signaling, with important implications for its role in normal B-cell biology and abnormal survival of malignant B cells.

33617875	The adipocyte hormone leptin regulates glucose homeostasis both centrally and peripherally. A key peripheral target is the pancreatic beta-cell, which secretes insulin upon glucose stimulation. Leptin is known to suppress glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by promoting trafficking of KATP channels to the beta-cell surface, which increases K(+) conductance and causes beta-cell hyperpolarization. We have previously shown that leptin-induced KATP channel trafficking requires protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent actin remodeling. However, whether PKA is a downstream effector of leptin signaling or PKA plays a permissive role is unknown. Using FRET-based reporters of PKA activity, we show that leptin increases PKA activity at the cell membrane and that this effect is dependent on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, CaMKKbeta, and AMPK, which are known to be involved in the leptin signaling pathway. Genetic knockdown and rescue experiments reveal that the increased PKA activity upon leptin stimulation requires the membrane-targeted PKA-anchoring protein AKAP79/150, indicating that PKA activated by leptin is anchored to AKAP79/150. Interestingly, disrupting protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) anchoring to AKAP79/150, known to elevate basal PKA signaling, leads to increased surface KATP channels even in the absence of leptin stimulation. Our findings uncover a novel role of AKAP79/150 in coordinating leptin and PKA signaling to regulate KATP channel trafficking in beta-cells, hence insulin secretion. The study further advances our knowledge of the downstream signaling events that may be targeted to restore insulin secretion regulation in beta-cells defective in leptin signaling, such as those from obese individuals with type 2 diabetes.

33548229	Skeletal muscle is one of the most important organs of the animal body. Long noncoding RNAs play a crucial role in the regulation of skeletal muscle development via several mechanisms. We recently identified obesity-related lncRNA (lnc-ORA) in a search for long noncoding RNAs that influence adipogenesis, finding it impacted adipocyte differentiation by regulating the PI3K/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. However, whether lnc-ORA has additional roles, specifically in skeletal muscle myogenesis, is not known. Here, we found that lnc-ORA was significantly differentially expressed with age in mouse skeletal muscle tissue and predominantly located in the cytoplasm. Overexpression of lnc-ORA promoted C2C12 myoblast proliferation and inhibited myoblast differentiation. In contrast, lnc-ORA knockdown repressed myoblast proliferation and facilitated myoblast differentiation. Interestingly, silencing of lnc-ORA rescued dexamethasone-induced muscle atrophy in vitro. Furthermore, adeno-associated virus 9-mediated overexpression of lnc-ORA decreased muscle mass and the cross-sectional area of muscle fiber by upregulating the levels of muscle atrophy-related genes and downregulating the levels of myogenic differentiation-related genes in vivo. Mechanistically, lnc-ORA inhibited skeletal muscle myogenesis by acting as a sponge of miR-532-3p, which targets the phosphatase and tensin homolog gene; the resultant changes in phosphatase and tensin homolog suppressed the PI3K/protein kinase B signaling pathway. In addition, lnc-ORA interacted with insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 and reduced the stability of myogenesis genes, such as myogenic differentiation 1 and myosin heavy chain. Collectively, these findings indicate that lnc-ORA could be a novel underlying regulator of skeletal muscle development.	Lnc-ORA interacts with microRNA-532-3p and IGF2BP2 to inhibit skeletal muscle myogenesis.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0
33493514	The Golgi apparatus (GA) is a cellular organelle that plays a critical role in the processing of proteins for secretion. Activation of G protein-coupled receptors at the plasma membrane (PM) induces the translocation of G protein betagamma dimers to the GA. However, the functional significance of this translocation is largely unknown. Here, we study PM-GA translocation of all 12 Ggamma subunits in response to chemokine receptor CXCR4 activation and demonstrate that Ggamma9 is a unique Golgi-translocating Ggamma subunit. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of Ggamma9 abolishes activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), two members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, by CXCR4. We show that chemically induced recruitment to the GA of Gbetagamma dimers containing different Ggamma subunits activates ERK1/2, whereas recruitment to the PM is ineffective. We also demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kgamma) and depletion of its subunits p110gamma and p101 abrogate ERK1/2 activation by CXCR4 and Gbetagamma recruitment to the GA. Knockout of either Ggamma9 or PI3Kgamma significantly suppresses prostate cancer PC3 cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Collectively, our data demonstrate a novel function for Gbetagamma translocation to the GA, via activating PI3Kgamma heterodimers p110gamma-p101, to spatiotemporally regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase activation by G protein-coupled receptors and ultimately control tumor progression.

33484713	The insulin receptor (INSR) binds insulin to promote body growth and maintain normal blood glucose levels. While it is known that steroid hormones such as estrogen and 20-hydroxyecdysone counteract insulin function, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this attenuation remain unclear. In the present study, using the agricultural pest lepidopteran Helicoverpa armigera as a model, we proposed that the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) induces dephosphorylation of INSR to counteract insulin function. We observed high expression and phosphorylation of INSR during larval feeding stages that decreased during metamorphosis. Insulin upregulated INSR expression and phosphorylation, whereas 20E repressed INSR expression and induced INSR dephosphorylation in vivo. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B, encoded by Ptpn1) dephosphorylated INSR in vivo. PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) was critical for 20E-induced INSR dephosphorylation by maintaining the transcription factor Forkhead box O (FoxO) in the nucleus, where FoxO promoted Ptpn1 expression and repressed Insr expression. Knockdown of Ptpn1 using RNA interference maintained INSR phosphorylation, increased 20E production, and accelerated pupation. RNA interference of Insr in larvae repressed larval growth, decreased 20E production, delayed pupation, and accumulated hemolymph glucose levels. Taken together, these results suggest that a high 20E titer counteracts the insulin pathway by dephosphorylating INSR to stop larval growth and accumulate glucose in the hemolymph.

33450223	Autophagy is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis through removing impaired organelles. It has recently been found to play pivotal roles in diabetes mellitus (DM), which is associated with increased bone fracture risk and loss of bone density. However, the mechanism whereby autophagy modulates DM-induced bone loss is not fully elucidated. Previous work has shown that 1alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) exerts positive effects on autophagy, thus affecting bone metabolism. Here, we investigated whether autophagy was involved in the regulation of diabetic bone metabolism. Using Micro-CT, Elisa, histology, and histomorphometry analysis, we demonstrated that 1,25D rescues glucose metabolism dysfunction and ameliorates bone loss in diabetic mice. In vitro, 1,25D alleviated primary osteoblast dysfunction and intracellular oxidative stress through reducing prolonged high-glucose-mediated excessive autophagy in primary osteoblasts, reflected by decreased protein level of Beclin1 and LC3. Of note, the autophagy activator rapamycin (RAP) ablated the positive effects of 1,25D in diabetic environment, leading to a marked increase in autolysosomes and autophagosomes, examined by mRFP-GFP-LC3 fluorescence double labeling. The excessive autophagy induced by high glucose was deleterious to proliferation and differentiation of primary osteoblasts. Additionally, biochemical studies identified that PI3K/Akt signaling could be activated by 1,25D, resulting in the inhibition of FoxO1. We confirmed that FoxO1 deficiency alleviated high-glucose-induced autophagy and improved biological functions of primary osteoblasts. Together, our results suggest that the PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 signaling pathway is involved in the osteoprotective effect of 1,25D by attenuating autophagy in diabetes, providing a novel insight for the prevention and treatment of diabetes-caused bone loss.	1alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 ameliorates diabetes-induced bone loss by attenuating FoxO1-mediated autophagy.

33428936	Proline and arginine-rich end leucine-rich repeat protein (PRELP) is a member of the small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycans (SLRPs) family. Levels of PRELP mRNA are downregulated in many types of cancer, and PRELP has been reported to have suppressive effects on tumor cell growth, although the molecular mechanism has yet to be fully elucidated. Given that other SLRPs regulate signaling pathways through interactions with various membrane proteins, we reasoned that PRELP likely interacts with membrane proteins to maintain cellular homeostasis. To identify membrane proteins that interact with PRELP, we carried out coimmunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry (CoIP-MS). We prepared membrane fractions from Expi293 cells transfected to overexpress FLAG-tagged PRELP or control cells and analyzed samples precipitated with anti-FLAG antibody by mass spectrometry. Comparison of membrane proteins in each sample identified several that seem to interact with PRELP; among them, we noted two growth factor receptors, insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGFI-R) and low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (p75NTR), interactions with which might help to explain PRELP's links to cancer. We demonstrated that PRELP directly binds to extracellular domains of these two growth factor receptors with low micromolar affinities by surface plasmon resonance analysis using recombinant proteins. Furthermore, cell-based analysis using recombinant PRELP protein showed that PRELP suppressed cell growth and affected cell morphology of A549 lung carcinoma cells, also at micromolar concentration. These results suggest that PRELP regulates cellular functions through interactions with IGFI-R and p75NTR and provide a broader set of candidate partners for further exploration.

33428929	The mitogen-responsive, ETS-domain transcription factor ELK-1 stimulates the expression of immediate early genes at the onset of the cell cycle and participates in early developmental programming. ELK-1 is subject to multiple levels of posttranslational control, including phosphorylation, SUMOylation, and ubiquitination. Recently, removal of monoubiquitin from the ELK-1 ETS domain by the Ubiquitin Specific Protease USP17 was shown to augment ELK-1 transcriptional activity and promote cell proliferation. Here we have used coimmunoprecipitation experiments, protein turnover and ubiquitination assays, RNA-interference and gene expression analyses to examine the possibility that USP17 acts antagonistically with the F-box protein FBXO25, an E3 ubiquitin ligase previously shown to promote ELK-1 ubiquitination and degradation. Our data confirm that FBXO25 and ELK-1 interact in HEK293T cells and that FBXO25 is active toward Hand1 and HAX1, two of its other candidate substrates. However, our data indicate that FBXO25 neither promotes ubiquitination of ELK-1 nor impacts on its transcriptional activity and suggest that an E3 ubiquitin ligase other than FBXO25 regulates ELK-1 ubiquitination and function.	ELK-1 ubiquitination status and transcriptional activity are modulated independently of F-Box protein FBXO25.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0
33380425	The nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase Fyn and protein Ser/Thr phosphatase 2A (PP2A) are major multifunctional signaling molecules. Deregulation of Fyn and altered PP2A methylation are implicated in cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we tested the hypothesis that the methylation state of PP2A catalytic subunit, which influences PP2A subunit composition and substrate specificity, can affect Fyn regulation and function. Using Neuro-2a (N2a) neuroblastoma cell models, we first show that methylated PP2A holoenzymes containing the Balpha subunit coimmunoprecipitate and copurify with Fyn in membrane rafts. PP2A methylation status regulates Fyn distribution and Fyn-dependent neuritogenesis, likely in part by affecting actin dynamics. A methylation-incompetent PP2A mutant fails to interact with Fyn. It perturbs the normal partitioning of Fyn and amyloid precursor protein (APP) in membrane microdomains, which governs Fyn function and APP processing. This correlates with enhanced amyloidogenic cleavage of APP, a hallmark of AD pathogenesis. Conversely, enhanced PP2A methylation promotes the nonamyloidogenic cleavage of APP in a Fyn-dependent manner. Disturbances in one-carbon metabolic pathways that control cellular methylation are associated with AD and cancer. Notably, they induce a parallel loss of membrane-associated methylated PP2A and Fyn enzymes in N2a cells and acute mouse brain slices. One-carbon metabolism also modulates Fyn-dependent process outgrowth in N2a cells. Thus, our findings identify a novel methylation-dependent PP2A/Fyn signaling module. They highlight the underestimated importance of cross talks between essential metabolic pathways and signaling scaffolds that are involved in normal cell homeostasis and currently being targeted for cancer and AD treatment.	Disturbances in PP2A methylation and one-carbon metabolism compromise Fyn distribution, neuritogenesis, and APP regulation.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0
33334891	Cohesin is a multiprotein ring complex that regulates 3D genome organization, sister chromatid cohesion, gene expression, and DNA repair. Cohesin is known to be ubiquitinated, although the mechanism, regulation, and effects of cohesin ubiquitination remain poorly defined. We previously used gene editing to introduce a dual epitope tag into the endogenous allele of each of 11 known components of cohesin in human HCT116 cells. Here we report that mass spectrometry analysis of dual-affinity purifications identified the USP13 deubiquitinase as a novel cohesin-interacting protein. Subsequent immunoprecipitation/Western blots confirmed the endogenous interaction in HCT116, 293T, HeLa, and RPE-hTERT cells; demonstrated that the interaction occurs specifically in the soluble nuclear fraction (not in the chromatin); requires the ubiquitin-binding domains (UBA1/2) of USP13; and occurs preferentially during DNA replication. Reciprocal dual-affinity purification of endogenous USP13 followed by mass spectrometry demonstrated that cohesin is its primary interactor in the nucleus. Ectopic expression and CRISPR knockout of USP13 showed that USP13 is paradoxically required for both deubiquitination and ubiquitination of cohesin subunits in human cells. USP13 was dispensable for sister chromatid cohesion in HCT116 and HeLa cells, whereas it was required for the dissociation of cohesin from chromatin as cells transit through mitosis. Together these results identify USP13 as a new cohesin-interacting protein that regulates the ubiquitination of cohesin and its cell cycle regulated interaction with chromatin.

33334880	Acetylation is known to regulate the activity of cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1), a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis, by promoting the reverse reaction of the enzyme (converting phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate). It is also known that the histone acetyltransferase p300 can induce PCK1 acetylation in cells, but whether that is a direct or indirect function was not known. Here we initially set out to determine whether p300 can acetylate directly PCK1 in vitro. We report that p300 weakly acetylates PCK1, but surprisingly, using several techniques including protein crystallization, mass spectrometry, isothermal titration calorimetry, saturation-transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular docking, we found that PCK1 is also able to acetylate itself using acetyl-CoA independently of p300. This reaction yielded an acetylated recombinant PCK1 with a 3-fold decrease in kcat without changes in Km for all substrates. Acetylation stoichiometry was determined for 14 residues, including residues lining the active site. Structural and kinetic analyses determined that site-directed acetylation of K244, located inside the active site, altered this site and rendered the enzyme inactive. In addition, we found that acetyl-CoA binding to the active site is specific and metal dependent. Our findings provide direct evidence for acetyl-CoA binding and chemical reaction with the active site of PCK1 and suggest a newly discovered regulatory mechanism of PCK1 during metabolic stress.

33288677	Posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression plays a critical role in controlling the inflammatory response. An uncontrolled inflammatory response results in chronic inflammation, often leading to tumorigenesis. Programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) is a proinflammatory tumor-suppressor gene which helps to prevent the transition from chronic inflammation to cancer. PDCD4 mRNA translation is regulated by an interplay between the oncogenic microRNA miR-21 and the RNA-binding protein (RBP) human antigen R (HuR) in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation, but the role of other regulatory factors remains unknown. Here, we report that the RBP lupus antigen (La) interacts with the 3'-untranslated region of PDCD4 mRNA and prevents miR-21-mediated translation repression. While lipopolysaccharide causes nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of HuR, it enhances cellular La expression. Remarkably, La and HuR were found to bind cooperatively to the PDCD4 mRNA and mitigate miR-21-mediated translation repression. The cooperative action of La and HuR reduced cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis, reversing the pro-oncogenic function of miR-21. Together, these observations demonstrate a cooperative interplay between two RBPs, triggered differentially by the same stimulus, which exerts a synergistic effect on PDCD4 expression and thereby helps maintain a balance between inflammation and tumorigenesis.

33219129	ABHD5 is an essential coactivator of ATGL, the rate-limiting triglyceride (TG) lipase in many cell types. Importantly, ABHD5 also functions as a tumor suppressor, and ABHD5 mRNA expression levels correlate with patient survival for several cancers. Nevertheless, the mechanisms involved in ABHD5-dependent tumor suppression are not known. We found that overexpression of ABHD5 induces cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase and causes growth retardation in a panel of prostate cancer cells. Transcriptomic profiling and biochemical analysis revealed that genetic or pharmacological activation of lipolysis by ABHD5 potently inhibits mTORC1 signaling, leading to a significant downregulation of protein synthesis. Mechanistically, we found that ABHD5 elevates intracellular AMP content, which activates AMPK, leading to inhibition of mTORC1. Interestingly, ABHD5-dependent suppression of mTORC1 was abrogated by pharmacological inhibition of DGAT1 or DGAT2, isoenzymes that re-esterify fatty acids in a process that consumes ATP. Collectively, this study maps out a novel molecular pathway crucial for limiting cancer cell proliferation, in which ABHD5-mediated lipolysis creates an energy-consuming futile cycle between TG hydrolysis and resynthesis, leading to inhibition of mTORC1 and cancer cell growth arrest.	ABHD5 suppresses cancer cell anabolism through lipolysis-dependent activation of the AMPK/mTORC1 pathway.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0
33219128	The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB) plays an important role in biological processes such as cell cycle control, DNA damage repair, epigenetic regulation, and genome stability. The canonical model of RB regulation is that cyclin-CDKs phosphorylate and render RB inactive in late G1/S, promoting entry into S phase. Recently, monophosphorylated RB species were described to have distinct cell-cycle-independent functions, suggesting that a phosphorylation code dictates diversity of RB function. However, a biologically relevant, functional role of RB phosphorylation at non-CDK sites has remained elusive. Here, we investigated S838/T841 dual phosphorylation, its upstream stimulus, and downstream functional output. We found that mimicking T-cell receptor activation in Jurkat leukemia cells induced sequential activation of downstream kinases including p38 MAPK and RB S838/T841 phosphorylation. This signaling pathway disrupts RB and condensin II interaction with chromatin. Using cells expressing a WT or S838A/T841A mutant RB fragment, we present evidence that deficiency for this phosphorylation event prevents condensin II release from chromatin.	Phosphorylation of the RB C-terminus regulates condensin II release from chromatin.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0
33219126	Members of the metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) superfamily of enzymes harbor a highly conserved alphabetabetaalpha MBL-fold domain and were first described as inactivators of common beta-lactam antibiotics. In humans, these enzymes have been shown to exhibit diverse functions, including hydrolase activity toward amides, esters, and thioesters. An uncharacterized member of the human MBL family, MBLAC2, was detected in multiple palmitoylproteomes, identified as a zDHHC20 S-acyltransferase interactor, and annotated as a potential thioesterase. In this study, we confirmed that MBLAC2 is palmitoylated and identified the likely S-palmitoylation site as Cys254. S-palmitoylation of MBLAC2 is increased in cells when expressed with zDHHC20, and MBLAC2 is a substrate for purified zDHHC20 in vitro. To determine its biochemical function, we tested the ability of MBLAC2 to hydrolyze a variety of small molecules and acylprotein substrates. MBLAC2 has acyl-CoA thioesterase activity with kinetic parameters and acyl-CoA selectivity comparable with acyl-CoA thioesterase 1 (ACOT1). Two predicted zinc-binding residues, Asp87 and His88, are required for MBLAC2 hydrolase activity. Consistent with a role in fatty acid metabolism in cells, MBLAC2 was cross-linked to a photoactivatable fatty acid in a manner that was independent of its S-fatty acylation at Cys254. Our study adds to previous investigations demonstrating the versatility of the MBL-fold domain in supporting a variety of enzymatic reactions.

33199372	The family of K(+)-dependent Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchangers, NCKX, are important mediators of cellular Ca(2+) efflux, particularly in neurons associated with sensory transduction. The NCKX family comprises five proteins, NCKX1-5, each being the product of a different SLC24 gene. NCKX4 (SLC24A4) has been found to have a critical role in termination and adaptation of visual and olfactory signals, melanocortin-dependent satiety signaling, and the maturation of dental enamel. To explore mechanisms that might influence the temporal control of NCKX4 activity, a yeast two-hybrid system was used to search for protein interaction partners. We identified calmodulin as a partner for NCKX4 and confirmed the interaction using glutathione-S-transferase fusion pull-down. Calmodulin binding to NCKX4 was demonstrated in extracts from mouse brain and in transfected HEK293 cells. Calmodulin bound in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner to a motif present in the central cytosolic loop of NCKX4 and was abolished by the double-mutant I328D/F334D. When cotransfected in HEK293 cells, calmodulin bound to NCKX4 under basal conditions and induced a approximately 2.5-fold increase in NCKX4 abundance, but did not influence either cellular location or basal activity. When purinergic stimulation of NCKX4 was examined in these cells, coexpression of wild-type calmodulin, but not a Ca(2+) binding-deficient calmodulin mutant, suppressed NCKX4 activation in a time-dependent manner. We propose that Ca(2+) binding to calmodulin prepositioned on NCKX4 induces a slow conformational rearrangement that interferes with purinergic stimulation of the exchanger, possibly by obscuring T331, a previously identified potential protein kinase C site.	Calmodulin binds and modulates K(+)-dependent Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchanger isoform 4, NCKX4.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0
33199366	Proper brain development and function requires finely controlled mechanisms for protein turnover, and disruption of genes involved in proteostasis is a common cause of neurodevelopmental disorders. Kelch-like 15 (KLHL15) is a substrate adaptor for cullin3-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases, and KLHL15 gene mutations were recently described as a cause of severe X-linked intellectual disability. Here, we used a bioinformatics approach to identify a family of neuronal microtubule-associated proteins as KLHL15 substrates, which are themselves critical for early brain development. We biochemically validated doublecortin (DCX), also an X-linked disease protein, and doublecortin-like kinase 1 and 2 as bona fide KLHL15 interactors and mapped KLHL15 interaction regions to their tandem DCX domains. Shared with two previously identified KLHL15 substrates, a FRY tripeptide at the C-terminal edge of the second DCX domain is necessary for KLHL15-mediated ubiquitination of DCX and doublecortin-like kinase 1 and 2 and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Conversely, silencing endogenous KLHL15 markedly stabilizes these DCX domain-containing proteins and prolongs their half-life. Functionally, overexpression of KLHL15 in the presence of WT DCX reduces dendritic complexity of cultured hippocampal neurons, whereas neurons expressing FRY-mutant DCX are resistant to KLHL15. Collectively, our findings highlight the critical importance of the E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor KLHL15 in proteostasis of neuronal microtubule-associated proteins and identify a regulatory network important for development of the mammalian nervous system.

33191271	AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a fundamental component of a protein kinase cascade that is an energy sensor. AMPK maintains energy homeostasis in the cell by promoting catabolic and inhibiting anabolic pathways. Activation of AMPK requires phosphorylation by the liver kinase B1 or by the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CaMKK2). The scaffold protein IQGAP1 regulates intracellular signaling pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT signaling cascades. Recent work implicates the participation of IQGAP1 in metabolic function, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood. Here, using several approaches including binding analysis with fusion proteins, siRNA-mediated gene silencing, RT-PCR, and knockout mice, we investigated whether IQGAP1 modulates AMPK signaling. In vitro analysis reveals that IQGAP1 binds directly to the alpha1 subunit of AMPK. In addition, we observed a direct interaction between IQGAP1 and CaMKK2, which is mediated by the IQ domain of IQGAP1. Both CaMKK2 and AMPK associate with IQGAP1 in cells. The ability of metformin and increased intracellular free Ca(2+) concentrations to activate AMPK is reduced in cells lacking IQGAP1. Importantly, Ca(2+)-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation was rescued by re-expression of IQGAP1 in IQGAP1-null cell lines. Comparison of the fasting response in wild-type and IQGAP1-null mice revealed that transcriptional regulation of the gluconeogenesis genes PCK1 and G6PC and the fatty acid synthesis genes FASN and ACC1 is impaired in IQGAP1-null mice. Our data disclose a previously unidentified functional interaction between IQGAP1 and AMPK and suggest that IQGAP1 modulates AMPK signaling.

33187986	Tubby-like proteins (TULPs) are characterized by a conserved C-terminal domain that binds phosphoinositides. Collectively, mammalian TULP1-4 proteins play essential roles in intracellular transport, cell differentiation, signaling, and motility. Yet, little is known about how the function of these proteins is regulated in cells. Here, we present the protein-protein interaction network of TULP3, a protein that is responsible for the trafficking of G-protein-coupled receptors to cilia and whose aberrant expression is associated with severe developmental disorders and polycystic kidney disease. We identify several protein interaction nodes linked to TULP3 that include enzymes involved in acetylation and ubiquitination. We show that acetylation of two key lysine residues on TULP3 by p300 increases TULP3 protein abundance and that deacetylation of these sites by HDAC1 decreases protein levels. Furthermore, we show that one of these sites is ubiquitinated in the absence of acetylation and that acetylation inversely correlates with ubiquitination of TULP3. This mechanism is evidently conserved across species and is active in zebrafish during development. Finally, we identify this same regulatory module in TULP1, TULP2, and TULP4 and demonstrate that the stability of these proteins is similarly modulated by an acetylation switch. This study unveils a signaling pathway that links nuclear enzymes to ciliary membrane receptors via TULP3, describes a dynamic mechanism for the regulation of all tubby-like proteins, and explores how to exploit it pharmacologically using drugs.	A conserved acetylation switch enables pharmacological control of tubby-like protein stability.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0
33187982	During mitosis, chromosomes are compacted in length by more than 100-fold into rod-shaped forms. In yeast, this process depends on the presence of a centromere, which promotes condensation in cis by recruiting mitotic kinases such as Aurora B kinase. This licensing mechanism enables the cell to discriminate chromosomal from noncentromeric DNA and to prohibit the propagation of the latter. Aurora B kinase elicits a cascade of events starting with phosphorylation of histone H3 serine 10 (H3S10ph), which signals the recruitment of lysine deacetylase Hst2 and the removal of lysine 16 acetylation in histone 4. The unmasked histone 4 tails interact with the acidic patch of neighboring nucleosomes to drive short-range compaction of chromatin, but the mechanistic details surrounding the Hst2 activity remain unclear. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we demonstrate that the interaction of Hst2 with H3S10ph is mediated by the yeast 14-3-3 protein Bmh1. As a homodimer, Bmh1 binds simultaneously to H3S10ph and the phosphorylated C-terminus of Hst2. Our pull-down experiments with extracts of synchronized cells show that the Hst2-Bmh1 interaction is cell cycle dependent, peaking in the M phase. Furthermore, we show that phosphorylation of C-terminal residues of Hst2, introduced by genetic code expansion, stimulates its deacetylase activity. Hence, the data presented here identify Bmh1 as a key player in the mechanism of licensing of chromosome compaction in mitosis.	14-3-3 Protein Bmh1 triggers short-range compaction of mitotic chromosomes by recruiting sirtuin deacetylase Hst2.

33154164	Inducible degrader of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (IDOL) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase mediating degradation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR). IDOL also controls its own stability through autoubiquitination, primarily at lysine 293. Whether IDOL may undergo other forms of posttranslational modification is unknown. In this study, we show that IDOL can be modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 at the K293 residue at least. The SUMOylation of IDOL counteracts its ubiquitination and augments IDOL protein levels. SUMOylation and the associated increase of IDOL protein are effectively reversed by SUMO-specific peptidase 1 (SENP1) in an activity-dependent manner. We further demonstrate that SENP1 affects LDLR protein levels by modulating IDOL. Overexpression of SENP1 increases LDLR protein levels and enhances LDL uptake in cultured cells. On the contrary, loss of SENP1 lowers LDLR levels in an IDOL-dependent manner and reduces LDL endocytosis. Collectively, our results reveal SUMOylation as a new regulatory posttranslational modification of IDOL and suggest that SENP1 positively regulates the LDLR pathway via deSUMOylation of IDOL and may therefore be exploited for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.	SUMOylation of the ubiquitin ligase IDOL decreases LDL receptor levels and is reversed by SENP1.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0
33144328	Somatic cells can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells with a minimal set of defined factors, Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc, also known as OKSM, although this reprogramming is somewhat inefficient. Recent work has identified other nuclear factors, including SALL4, that can synergize with the OSK factors to improve reprogramming dynamics, but the specific role of each of these factors remains poorly understood. In this study, we sought to learn more about the role of SALL4. We observed that SALL4 was the most significant factor in promoting OKS-induced reprogramming. To look for molecules downstream of SALL4, we screened a set of putative targets to determine whether they could promote OKS-induced reprogramming. We identified CECR2, a multidomain nuclear factor and histone acetyl-lysine reader, as a SALL4 effector. Mechanistically, we determined that SALL4 activates Cecr2 expression by directly binding to its promotor region. CECR2 in turn promotes reprogramming by forming a chromatin remodeling complex; this complex contained the SWI/SNF family member SMARCA1 and was dependent on CECR2's DTT domain. In combination, our findings suggest that CECR2 is a novel reprogramming factor and works through a protein network to overcome epigenetic barriers during reprogramming.

34157286	Post-translational modifications to tubulin are important for many microtubule-based functions inside cells. It was recently shown that methylation of tubulin by the histone methyltransferase SETD2 occurs on mitotic spindle microtubules during cell division, with its absence resulting in mitotic defects. However, the catalytic mechanism of methyl addition to tubulin is unclear. We used a truncated version of human wild type SETD2 (tSETD2) containing the catalytic SET and C-terminal Set2-Rpb1-interacting (SRI) domains to investigate the biochemical mechanism of tubulin methylation. We found that recombinant tSETD2 had a higher activity toward tubulin dimers than polymerized microtubules. Using recombinant single-isotype tubulin, we demonstrated that methylation was restricted to lysine 40 of alpha-tubulin. We then introduced pathogenic mutations into tSETD2 to probe the recognition of histone and tubulin substrates. A mutation in the catalytic domain (R1625C) allowed tSETD2 to bind to tubulin but not methylate it, whereas a mutation in the SRI domain (R2510H) caused loss of both tubulin binding and methylation. Further investigation of the role of the SRI domain in substrate binding found that mutations within this region had differential effects on the ability of tSETD2 to bind to tubulin versus the binding partner RNA polymerase II for methylating histones in vivo, suggesting distinct mechanisms for tubulin and histone methylation by SETD2. Finally, we found that substrate recognition also requires the negatively charged C-terminal tail of alpha-tubulin. Together, this study provides a framework for understanding how SETD2 serves as a dual methyltransferase for both histone and tubulin methylation.

34146542	Liver fibrosis is a common characteristic of chronic liver diseases. The activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) plays a key role in fibrogenesis in response to liver injury, yet the mechanism by which damaged hepatocytes modulate the activation of HSCs is poorly understood. Our previous studies have established that liver-specific deletion of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT)leads to hepatocyte necroptosis and spontaneous fibrosis. Here, we report that OGT-deficient hepatocytes secrete trefoil factor 2 (TFF2) that activates HSCs and contributes to the fibrogenic process. The expression and secretion of TFF2 are induced in OGT-deficient hepatocytes but not in WT hepatocytes. TFF2 activates the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta signaling pathway that promotes the proliferation and migration of primary HSCs. TFF2 protein expression is elevated in mice with carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury. These findings identify TFF2 as a novel factor that mediates intercellular signaling between hepatocytes and HSCs and suggest a role of the hepatic OGT-TFF2 axis in the process of fibrogenesis.

34087234	Reperfusion therapy, the standard treatment for acute myocardial infarction, can trigger necrotic death of cardiomyocytes and provoke ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, signaling pathways that regulate cardiomyocyte necrosis remain largely unknown. Our recent genome-wide RNAi screen has identified a potential necrosis suppressor gene PRKAR1A, which encodes PKA regulatory subunit 1alpha (R1alpha). R1alpha is primarily known for regulating PKA activity by sequestering PKA catalytic subunits in the absence of cAMP. Here, we showed that depletion of R1alpha augmented cardiomyocyte necrosis in vitro and in vivo, resulting in exaggerated myocardial I/R injury and contractile dysfunction. Mechanistically, R1alpha loss downregulated the Nrf2 antioxidant transcription factor and aggravated oxidative stress following I/R. Degradation of the endogenous Nrf2 inhibitor Keap1 through p62-dependent selective autophagy was blocked by R1alpha depletion. Phosphorylation of p62 at Ser349 by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a critical step in p62-Keap1 interaction, was induced by I/R, but diminished by R1alpha loss. Activation of PKA by forskolin or isoproterenol almost completely abolished hydrogen-peroxide-induced p62 phosphorylation. In conclusion, R1alpha loss induces unrestrained PKA activation and impairs the mTORC1-p62-Keap1-Nrf2 antioxidant defense system, leading to aggravated oxidative stress, necrosis, and myocardial I/R injury. Our findings uncover a novel role of PKA in oxidative stress and necrosis, which may be exploited to develop new cardioprotective therapies.

34058200	Within the intestinal epithelium, regulation of intracellular protein and vesicular trafficking is of utmost importance for barrier maintenance, immune responses, and tissue polarity. RAB11A is a small GTPase that mediates the anterograde transport of protein cargos to the plasma membrane. Loss of RAB11A-dependent trafficking in mature intestinal epithelial cells results in increased epithelial proliferation and nuclear accumulation of Yes-associated protein (YAP), a key Hippo-signaling transducer that senses cell-cell contacts and regulates tissue growth. However, it is unclear how RAB11A regulates YAP intracellular localizations. In this report, we examined the relationship of RAB11A to epithelial junctional complexes, YAP, and the associated consequences on colonic epithelial tissue repair. We found that RAB11A controls the biochemical associations of YAP with multiple components of adherens and tight junctions, including alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and Merlin, a tumor suppressor. In the absence of RAB11A and Merlin, we observed enhanced YAP-beta-catenin complex formation and nuclear translocation. Upon chemical injury to the intestine, mice deficient in RAB11A were found to have reduced epithelial integrity, decreased YAP localization to adherens and tight junctions, and increased nuclear YAP accumulation in the colon epithelium. Thus, RAB11A-regulated trafficking regulates the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway for rapid reparative response after tissue injury.	RAB11A-mediated YAP localization to adherens and tight junctions is essential for colonic epithelial integrity.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0
34029592	The cleavage of the insulin receptor by beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) in the liver increases during diabetes, which contributes to reduce insulin receptor levels and impair insulin signaling. However, the precise signaling events that lead to this increased cleavage are unclear. We showed that BACE1 cleaves the insulin receptor in the early secretory pathway. Indeed, coimmunoprecipitation experiments reveal the interaction of the proforms of the two proteins. Moreover, fragments of insulin receptor are detected in the early secretory pathway and a mutated form of BACE1 that retains its prodomain cleaves an early secretory pathway-resident form of the insulin receptor. We showed that BACE1 proform levels are regulated by proteasome and/or lysosome-dependent degradation systems whose efficiencies are dependent on the O-GlcNacylation process. Our results showed that enhanced O-GlcNacylation reduces the efficiency of intracellular protein degradation systems, leading to the accumulation of the proform of BACE1 in the early secretory pathway where it cleaves the precursor of the insulin receptor. All these dysregulations are found in the livers of diabetic mice. In addition, we performed a screen of molecules according to their ability to increase levels of the insulin receptor at the surface of BACE1-overexpressing cells. This approach identified the aminosterol Claramine, which accelerated intracellular trafficking of the proform of BACE1 and increased autophagy. Both of these effects likely contribute to the reduced amount of the proform of BACE1 in the early secretory pathway, thereby reducing insulin receptor cleavage. These newly described properties of Claramine are consistent with its insulin sensitizing effect.	The aminosterol Claramine inhibits beta-secretase 1-mediated insulin receptor cleavage.

34029587	Viral proteins are known to be methylated by host protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) necessary for the viral life cycle, but it remains unknown whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins are methylated. Herein, we show that PRMT1 methylates SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein at residues R95 and R177 within RGG/RG motifs, preferred PRMT target sequences. We confirmed arginine methylation of N protein by immunoblotting viral proteins extracted from SARS-CoV-2 virions isolated from cell culture. Type I PRMT inhibitor (MS023) or substitution of R95 or R177 with lysine inhibited interaction of N protein with the 5'-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, a property required for viral packaging. We also defined the N protein interactome in HEK293 cells, which identified PRMT1 and many of its RGG/RG substrates, including the known interacting protein G3BP1 as well as other components of stress granules (SGs), which are part of the host antiviral response. Methylation of R95 regulated the ability of N protein to suppress the formation of SGs, as R95K substitution or MS023 treatment blocked N-mediated suppression of SGs. Also, the coexpression of methylarginine reader Tudor domain-containing protein 3 quenched N protein-mediated suppression of SGs in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, pretreatment of VeroE6 cells with MS023 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication. Because type I PRMT inhibitors are already undergoing clinical trials for cancer treatment, inhibiting arginine methylation to target the later stages of the viral life cycle such as viral genome packaging and assembly of virions may represent an additional therapeutic application of these drugs.

34303707	Metformin is the first-line antidiabetic agent for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatment. Although accumulated evidence has shed light on the consequences of metformin action, the precise mechanisms of its action, especially in the pancreas, are not fully understood. Aquaporin 7 (AQP7) acts as a critical regulator of intraislet glycerol content, which is necessary for insulin production and secretion. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different doses of metformin on AQP7 expression and explore the possible mechanism of its protective effects in the pancreatic islets. We used an in vivo model of high-fat diet in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats and an in vitro model of rat pancreatic beta-cells (INS-1 cells) damaged by hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Our data showed that AQP7 expression levels were decreased, whereas p38 and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were activated in vivo and in vitro in response to hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. T2DM rats treated with metformin demonstrated a reduction in blood glucose levels and increased regeneration of pancreatic beta-cells. In addition, metformin upregulated AQP7 expression as well as inhibited activation of p38 and JNK MAPKs both in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of AQP7 increased glycerol influx into INS-1 cells, whereas inhibition of AQP7 reduced glycerol influx, thereby decreasing subsequent insulin secretion. Our findings demonstrate a new mechanism by which metformin suppresses the p38 and JNK pathways, thereby upregulating pancreatic AQP7 expression and promoting glycerol influx into pancreatic beta-cells and subsequent insulin secretion in T2DM.	Metformin inhibits MAPK signaling and rescues pancreatic aquaporin 7 expression to induce insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes mellitus.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0
34293347	NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) produces the superoxide anion radical (O2(-)), which has functions in both cell signaling and immune defense. NOX2 is a multimeric-protein complex consisting of several protein subunits including the GTPase Rac. NOX2 uniquely facilitates an oxidative burst, which is described by initially slow O2(-) production, which increases over time. The NOX2 oxidative burst is considered critical to immune defense because it enables expedited O2(-) production in response to infections. However, the mechanism of the initiation and progression of this oxidative burst and its implications for regulation of NOX2 have not been clarified. In this study, we show that the NOX2 oxidative burst is a result of autoactivation of NOX2 coupled with the redox function of Rac. NOX2 autoactivation begins when active Rac triggers NOX2 activation and the subsequent production of O2(-), which in turn activates redox-sensitive Rac. This activated Rac further activates NOX2, amplifying the feedforward cycle and resulting in a NOX2-mediated oxidative burst. Using mutagenesis-based kinetic and cell analyses, we show that enzymatic activation of Rac is exclusively responsible for production of the active Rac trigger that initiates NOX2 autoactivation, whereas redox-mediated Rac activation is the main driving force of NOX2 autoactivation and contributes to generation of approximately 98% of the active NOX2 in cells. The results of this study provide insight into the regulation of NOX2 function, which could be used to develop therapeutics to control immune responses associated with dysregulated NOX2 oxidative bursts.	Rac-dependent feedforward autoactivation of NOX2 leads to oxidative burst.	The Journal of biological chemistry	1
34274317	Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a common kidney disorder caused by dysfunction of the glomerular filtration barrier. Some genetic mutations identified in NS patients cause amino acid substitutions of kidney ankyrin repeat-containing (KANK) proteins, which are scaffold proteins that regulate actin polymerization, microtubule targeting, and cell adhesion via binding to various molecules, including the kinesin motor protein KIF21A. However, the mechanisms by which these mutations lead to NS are unclear. Here, we unexpectedly found that the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A1 (eIF4A1) interacts with an NS-associated KANK2 mutant (S684F) but not the wild-type protein. Biochemical and structural analyses revealed that the pathological mutation induces abnormal binding of eIF4A1 to KANK2 at the physiological KIF21A-binding site. Competitive binding assays further indicated that eIF4A1 can compete with KIF21A to interact with the S684F mutant of KANK2. In cultured mouse podocytes, this S684F mutant interfered with the KANK2/KIF21A interaction by binding to eIF4A1, and failed to rescue the focal adhesion or cell adhesion that had been reduced or morphologically changed by KANK2 knockout. These structural, biochemical, and cellular results not only provide mechanistic explanations for the podocyte defects caused by the S684F mutation, but also show how a gain-of-binding mutation can lead to a loss-of-function effect.

34270961	Transcription factors (TFs) harboring broad-complex, tramtrack, and bric-a-brac (BTB) domains play important roles in development and disease. These BTB domains are thought to recruit transcriptional modulators to target DNA regions. However, a systematic molecular understanding of the mechanism of action of this TF family is lacking. Here, we identify the zinc finger BTB-TF Zbtb2 from a genetic screen for regulators of exit from pluripotency and demonstrate that its absence perturbs embryonic stem cell differentiation and the gene expression dynamics underlying peri-implantation development. We show that ZBTB2 binds the chromatin remodeler Ep400 to mediate downstream transcription. Independently, the BTB domain directly interacts with nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase and histone chaperone histone regulator A. Nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase recruitment is a common feature of BTB TFs, and based on phylogenetic analysis, we propose that this is a conserved evolutionary property. Binding to UBN2, in contrast, is specific to ZBTB2 and requires a C-terminal extension of the BTB domain. Taken together, this study identifies a BTB-domain TF that recruits chromatin modifiers and a histone chaperone during a developmental cell state transition and defines unique and shared molecular functions of the BTB-domain TF family.	The BTB-domain transcription factor ZBTB2 recruits chromatin remodelers and a histone chaperone during the exit from pluripotency.	The Journal of biological chemistry	1
34252457	Phosphodiesterase 3A (PDE3A) selectively cleaves the phosphodiester bond of cAMP and is inhibited by cGMP, making it an important regulator of cAMP-cGMP signaling crosstalk in the pulmonary vasculature. In addition, the nitric oxide-cGMP axis is known to play an important role in maintaining endothelial barrier function. However, the potential role of protein kinase G-Ialpha (PKG-Ialpha) in this protective process is unresolved and was the focus of our study. We describe here a novel mechanism regulating PDE3A activity, which involves a PKG-Ialpha-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation of PDE3A at serine 654. We also show that this phosphorylation is critical for maintaining intracellular cAMP levels in the pulmonary endothelium and endothelial barrier integrity. In an animal model of acute lung injury (ALI) induced by challenging mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an increase in PDE3 activity and a decrease in cAMP levels in lung tissue was associated with reduced PKG activity upon PKG-Ialpha nitration at tyrosine 247. The peroxynitrite scavenger manganese (III) tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin prevented this increase in PDE3 activity in LPS-exposed lungs. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis of PDE3A to replace serine 654 with alanine yielded a mutant protein that was insensitive to PKG-dependent regulation. Taken together, our data demonstrate a novel functional link between nitrosative stress induced by LPS during ALI and the downregulation of barrier-protective intracellular cAMP levels. Our data also provide new evidence that PKG-Ialpha is critical for endothelial barrier maintenance and that preservation of its catalytic activity may be efficacious in ALI therapy.

34214498	Apart from prevention using vaccinations, the management options for COVID-19 remain limited. In retrospective cohort studies, use of famotidine, a specific oral H2 receptor antagonist (antihistamine), has been associated with reduced risk of intubation and death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. In a case series, nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 experienced rapid symptom resolution after taking famotidine, but the molecular basis of these observations remains elusive. Here we show using biochemical, cellular, and functional assays that famotidine has no effect on viral replication or viral protease activity. However, famotidine can affect histamine-induced signaling processes in infected Caco2 cells. Specifically, famotidine treatment inhibits histamine-induced expression of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and can reduce TLR3-dependent signaling processes that culminate in activation of IRF3 and the NF-kappaB pathway, subsequently controlling antiviral and inflammatory responses. SARS-CoV-2-infected cells treated with famotidine demonstrate reduced expression levels of the inflammatory mediators CCL-2 and IL6, drivers of the cytokine release syndrome that precipitates poor outcome for patients with COVID-19. Given that pharmacokinetic studies indicate that famotidine can reach concentrations in blood that suffice to antagonize histamine H2 receptors expressed in mast cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils, these observations explain how famotidine may contribute to the reduced histamine-induced inflammation and cytokine release, thereby improving the outcome for patients with COVID-19.

34174287	The thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC) in the renal distal convoluted tubule (DCT) plays a critical role in regulating blood pressure (BP) and K(+) homeostasis. During hyperkalemia, reduced NCC phosphorylation and total NCC abundance facilitate downstream electrogenic K(+) secretion and BP reduction. However, the mechanism for the K(+)-dependent reduction in total NCC levels is unknown. Here, we show that NCC levels were reduced in ex vivo renal tubules incubated in a high-K(+) medium for 24-48 h. This reduction was independent of NCC transcription, but was prevented using inhibitors of the proteasome (MG132) or lysosome (chloroquine). Ex vivo, high K(+) increased NCC ubiquitylation, but inhibition of the ubiquitin conjugation pathway prevented the high K(+)-mediated reduction in NCC protein. In tubules incubated in high K(+) media ex vivo or in the renal cortex of mice fed a high K(+) diet for 4 days, the abundance and phosphorylation of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), a key regulator of ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation and protein folding, were decreased. Conversely, in similar samples the expression of PP1alpha, known to dephosphorylate Hsp70, was also increased. NCC coimmunoprecipitated with Hsp70 and PP1alpha, and inhibiting their actions prevented the high K(+)-mediated reduction in total NCC levels. In conclusion, we show that hyperkalemia drives NCC ubiquitylation and degradation via a PP1alpha-dependent process facilitated by Hsp70. This mechanism facilitates K(+)-dependent reductions in NCC to protect plasma K(+) homeostasis and potentially reduces BP.

34418432	Tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) plays context-specific roles in multiple receptor-mediated signaling pathways in different cell types. Mice lacking TRAF3 in T cells display defective T-cell-mediated immune responses to immunization and infection and demonstrate defective early signaling via the TCR complex. However, the role of TRAF3 in the function of GITR/TNFRSF18, an important costimulatory member of the TNFR superfamily, is unclear. Here we investigated the impact of T cell TRAF3 status on both GITR expression and activation of specific kinases in the GITR signaling pathway in T cells. Our results indicate that TRAF3 negatively regulates GITR functions in several ways. First, expression of GITR protein was elevated in TRAF3-deficient T cells, resulting from both transcriptional and posttranslational regulation that led to greater GITR transcript levels, as well as enhanced GITR protein stability. TRAF3 associated with T cell GITR in a manner dependent upon GITR ligation. TRAF3 also inhibited several events of the GITR mediated early signaling cascade, in a manner independent of recruitment of phosphatases, a mechanism by which TRAF3 inhibits signaling through several other cytokine receptors. These results add new information to our understanding of GITR signaling and function in T cells, which is relevant to the potential use of GITR to enhance immune therapies.

34411563	Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) is the major component of extracellular matrix microfibrils, which are required for proper development of elastic tissues, including the heart and lungs. Through protein-protein interactions with latent transforming growth factor (TGF) beta-binding protein 1 (LTBP1), microfibrils regulate TGF-beta signaling. Mutations within the 47 epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats of FBN1 cause autosomal dominant disorders including Marfan Syndrome, which is characterized by disrupted TGF-beta signaling. We recently identified two novel protein O-glucosyltransferases, Protein O-glucosyltransferase 2 (POGLUT2) and 3 (POGLUT3), that modify a small fraction of EGF repeats on Notch. Here, using mass spectral analysis, we show that POGLUT2 and POGLUT3 also modify over half of the EGF repeats on FBN1, fibrillin-2 (FBN2), and LTBP1. While most sites are modified by both enzymes, some sites show a preference for either POGLUT2 or POGLUT3. POGLUT2 and POGLUT3 are homologs of POGLUT1, which stabilizes Notch proteins by addition of O-glucose to Notch EGF repeats. Like POGLUT1, POGLUT2 and 3 can discern a folded versus unfolded EGF repeat, suggesting POGLUT2 and 3 are involved in a protein folding pathway. In vitro secretion assays using the N-terminal portion of recombinant FBN1 revealed reduced FBN1 secretion in POGLUT2 knockout, POGLUT3 knockout, and POGLUT2 and 3 double-knockout HEK293T cells compared with wild type. These results illustrate that POGLUT2 and 3 function together to O-glucosylate protein substrates and that these modifications play a role in the secretion of substrate proteins. It will be interesting to see how disease variants in these proteins affect their O-glucosylation.

34343566	Proteins containing breast cancer type 1 (BRCA1) C-terminal domains play crucial roles in response to and repair of DNA damage. Epithelial cell transforming factor (epithelial cell transforming sequence 2 [ECT2]) is a member of the BRCA1 C-terminal protein family, but it is not known if ECT2 directly contributes to DNA repair. In this study, we report that ECT2 is recruited to DNA lesions in a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1-dependent manner. Using co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we showed that ECT2 physically associates with KU70-KU80 and BRCA1, proteins involved in nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination, respectively. ECT2 deficiency impairs the recruitment of KU70 and BRCA1 to DNA damage sites, resulting in defective DNA double-strand break repair, an accumulation of damaged DNA, and hypersensitivity of cells to genotoxic insults. Interestingly, we demonstrated that ECT2 promotes DNA repair and genome integrity largely independently of its canonical guanine nucleotide exchange activity. Together, these results suggest that ECT2 is directly involved in DNA double-strand break repair and is an important genome caretaker.	Epithelial cell transforming factor ECT2 is an important regulator of DNA double-strand break repair and genome stability.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0
34302807	The microtubule-based mitotic spindle is responsible for equally partitioning the genome during each cell division, and its assembly is executed via several microtubule nucleation pathways. Targeting Protein for XKlp2 (TPX2) stimulates the branching microtubule nucleation pathway, where new microtubules are nucleated from preexisting ones within mitotic or meiotic spindles. TPX2, like other spindle assembly factors, is sequestered by binding to nuclear importins-alpha/beta until the onset of mitosis, yet the molecular nature of this regulation remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that TPX2 interacts with importins-alpha/beta with nanomolar affinity in a 1:1:1 monodispersed trimer. We also identify a new nuclear localization sequence in TPX2 that contributes to its high-affinity interaction with importin-alpha. In addition, we establish that TPX2 interacts with importin-beta via dispersed, weak interactions. We show that interactions of both importin-alpha and -beta with TPX2 inhibit its ability to undergo phase separation, which was recently shown to enhance the kinetics of branching microtubule nucleation. In summary, our study informs how importins regulate TPX2 to facilitate spindle assembly, and provides novel insight into the functional regulation of protein phase separation.	Interaction of spindle assembly factor TPX2 with importins-alpha/beta inhibits protein phase separation.	The Journal of biological chemistry	0
32966797	Hemopexin (Hx) is a scavenger of labile heme. Herein, we present data defining the role of tumor stroma-expressed Hx in suppressing cancer progression. Labile heme and Hx levels are inversely correlated in the plasma of patients with prostate cancer (PCa). Further, low expression of Hx in PCa biopsies characterizes poorly differentiated tumors and correlates with earlier time to relapse. Significantly, heme promotes tumor growth and metastases in an orthotopic murine model of PCa, with the most aggressive phenotype detected in mice lacking Hx. Mechanistically, labile heme accumulates in the nucleus and modulates specific gene expression via interacting with guanine quadruplex (G4) DNA structures to promote PCa growth. We identify c-MYC as a heme:G4-regulated gene and a major player in heme-driven cancer progression. Collectively, these results reveal that sequestration of labile heme by Hx may block heme-driven tumor growth and metastases, suggesting a potential strategy to prevent and/or arrest cancer dissemination.

32941788	One of the features distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from its more pathogenic counterpart SARS-CoV is the presence of premature stop codons in its ORF3b gene. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b is a potent interferon antagonist, suppressing the induction of type I interferon more efficiently than its SARS-CoV ortholog. Phylogenetic analyses and functional assays reveal that SARS-CoV-2-related viruses from bats and pangolins also encode truncated ORF3b gene products with strong anti-interferon activity. Furthermore, analyses of approximately 17,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences identify a natural variant in which a longer ORF3b reading frame was reconstituted. This variant was isolated from two patients with severe disease and further increased the ability of ORF3b to suppress interferon induction. Thus, our findings not only help to explain the poor interferon response in COVID-19 patients but also describe the emergence of natural SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies with an extended ORF3b gene that may potentially affect COVID-19 pathogenesis.

32997987	Kinetochores are macromolecular protein assemblies at centromeres that mediate accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. The outer kinetochore KNL1(SPC105), MIS12(MTW1), and NDC80(NDC80) complexes assemble the KMN network, which harbors the sites of microtubule binding and spindle assembly checkpoint signaling. The buildup of the KMN network that transmits microtubule pulling forces to budding yeast point centromeres is poorly understood. Here, we identify 225 inter-protein crosslinks by mass spectrometry on KMN complexes isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that delineate the KMN subunit connectivity for outer kinetochore assembly. C-Terminal motifs of Nsl1 and Mtw1 recruit the SPC105 complex through Kre28, and both motifs aid tethering of the NDC80 complex by the previously reported Dsn1 C terminus. We show that a hub of three C-terminal MTW1 subunit motifs mediates the cooperative stabilization of the KMN network, which is augmented by a direct NDC80-SPC105 association.

33027660	Bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) cytokine family promoting differentiation, homeostasis, and self-renewal of multiple tissues. We show that signaling through the bone morphogenic protein receptor 1alpha (BMPR1alpha) sustains expression of FOXP3 in Treg cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues. BMPR1alpha signaling promotes molecular circuits supporting acquisition and preservation of Treg cell phenotype and inhibiting differentiation of pro-inflammatory effector Th1/Th17 CD4(+) T cell. Mechanistically, increased expression of KDM6B (JMJD3) histone demethylase, an antagonist of the polycomb repressive complex 2, underlies lineage-specific changes of T cell phenotypes associated with abrogation of BMPR1alpha signaling. These results reveal that BMPs are immunoregulatory cytokines mediating maturation and stability of peripheral FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg cells) and controlling generation of iTreg cells. Thus, we establish that BMPs, a large cytokine family, are an essential link between stromal tissues and the adaptive immune system involved in sustaining tissue homeostasis by promoting immunological tolerance.

33027646	The innate immune system responds to infections that give rise to pain. How the innate immune system interacts with the sensory nervous system and contributes to pain is poorly understood. Here we report that hyperactivity of innate immunity primes and initiates pain states via the TLR2-interleukin-33 (IL-33) axis. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are upregulated in the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) pain model, and knockout of TLR2 abolishes CFA-induced pain. Selective activation of TLR2/6 triggers acute pain via upregulation of IL-33 in the hindpaw, dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and spinal cord in an NLRP3-dependent manner. The IL-33 increase further initiates priming of nociceptive neurons and pain states. Finally, blocking IL-33 receptors at the spinal level mediates analgesia during acute and chronic inflammatory pain, underscoring an important function of IL-33 in pain signaling. Collectively, our data reveal a critical role of the TLR2-IL-33 axis in innate immune activation for pain initiation and maintenance.

33053355	Current models of mRNA turnover indicate that cytoplasmic degradation is coupled with translation. However, our understanding of the molecular events that coordinate ribosome transit with the mRNA decay machinery is still limited. Here, we show that 4EHP-GIGYF1/2 complexes trigger co-translational mRNA decay. Human cells lacking these proteins accumulate mRNAs with prominent ribosome pausing. They include, among others, transcripts encoding secretory and membrane-bound proteins or tubulin subunits. In addition, 4EHP-GIGYF1/2 complexes fail to reduce mRNA levels in the absence of ribosome stalling or upon disruption of their interaction with the cap structure, DDX6, and ZNF598. We further find that co-translational binding of GIGYF1/2 to the mRNA marks transcripts with perturbed elongation to decay. Our studies reveal how a repressor complex linked to neurological disorders minimizes the protein output of a subset of mRNAs.	4EHP and GIGYF1/2 Mediate Translation-Coupled Messenger RNA Decay.

33086055	MutSalpha and MutSbeta play important roles in DNA mismatch repair and are linked to inheritable cancers and degenerative disorders. Here, we show that MSH2 and MSH3, the two components of MutSbeta, bind SLX4 protein, a scaffold for the assembly of the SLX1-SLX4-MUS81-EME1-XPF-ERCC1 (SMX) trinuclease complex. SMX promotes the resolution of Holliday junctions (HJs), which are intermediates in homologous recombinational repair. We find that MutSbeta binds HJs and stimulates their resolution by SLX1-SLX4 or SMX in reactions dependent upon direct interactions between MutSbeta and SLX4. In contrast, MutSalpha does not stimulate HJ resolution. MSH3-depleted cells exhibit reduced sister chromatid exchanges and elevated levels of homologous recombination ultrafine bridges (HR-UFBs) at mitosis, consistent with defects in the processing of recombination intermediates. These results demonstrate a role for MutSbeta in addition to its established role in the pathogenic expansion of CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats, which is causative of myotonic dystrophy and Huntington's disease.

33113367	The tumor suppressor p53 regulates multiple metabolic pathways at the cellular level. However, its role in the context of a whole animal response to metabolic stress is poorly understood. Using Drosophila, we show that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent Dmp53 activation is critical for sensing nutrient stress, maintaining metabolic homeostasis, and extending organismal survival. Under both nutrient deprivation and high-sugar diet, Dmp53 activation in the fat body represses expression of the Drosophila Leptin analog, Unpaired-2 (Upd2), which remotely controls Dilp2 secretion in insulin-producing cells. In starved Dmp53-depleted animals, elevated Upd2 expression in adipose cells and activation of Upd2 receptor Domeless in the brain result in sustained Dilp2 circulating levels and impaired autophagy induction at a systemic level, thereby reducing nutrient stress survival. These findings demonstrate an essential role for the AMPK-Dmp53 axis in nutrient stress responses and expand the concept that adipose tissue acts as a sensing organ that orchestrates systemic adaptation to nutrient status.

33147468	The regulation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) trafficking affects multiple brain functions, such as learning and memory. We have previously shown that Thorase plays an important role in the internalization of AMPARs from the synaptic membrane. Here, we show that N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation leads to increased S-nitrosylation of Thorase and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF). S-nitrosylation of Thorase stabilizes Thorase-AMPAR complexes and enhances the internalization of AMPAR and interaction with protein-interacting C kinase 1 (PICK1). S-nitrosylated NSF is dependent on the S-nitrosylation of Thorase via trans-nitrosylation, which modulates the surface insertion of AMPARs. In the presence of the S-nitrosylation-deficient C137L Thorase mutant, AMPAR trafficking, long-term potentiation, and long-term depression are impaired. Overall, our data suggest that both S-nitrosylation and interactions of Thorase and NSF/PICK1 are required to modulate AMPAR-mediated synaptic plasticity. This study provides critical information that elucidates the mechanism underlying Thorase and NSF-mediated trafficking of AMPAR complexes.

33147463	Dysregulated gene expression is a common feature of cancer and may underlie some aspects of tumor progression, including tumor relapse. Here, we show that recurrent mammary tumors exhibit global changes in gene expression and histone modifications and acquire dependence on the G9a histone methyltransferase. Genetic ablation of G9a delays tumor recurrence, and pharmacologic inhibition of G9a slows the growth of recurrent tumors. Mechanistically, G9a activity is required to silence pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), through H3K9 methylation at gene promoters. G9a inhibition induces re-expression of these cytokines, leading to p53 activation and necroptosis. Recurrent tumors upregulate receptor interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) expression and are dependent upon RIPK3 activity. High RIPK3 expression renders recurrent tumors sensitive to necroptosis following G9a inhibition. These findings demonstrate that G9a-mediated silencing of pro-necroptotic proteins is a critical step in tumor recurrence and suggest that G9a is a targetable dependency in recurrent breast cancer.

33147462	Influenza A virus (IAV) infection stimulates a type I interferon (IFN-I) response in host cells that exerts antiviral effects by inducing the expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). However, most ISGs are poorly studied for their roles in the infection of IAV. Herein, we demonstrate that SERTA domain containing 3 (SERTAD3) has a significant inhibitory effect on IAV replication in vitro. More importantly, Sertad3(-/-) mice develop more severe symptoms upon IAV infection. Mechanistically, we find SERTAD3 reduces IAV replication through interacting with viral polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), and polymerase acidic protein (PA) to disrupt the formation of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex. We further identify an 8-amino-acid peptide of SERTAD3 as a minimum interacting motif that can disrupt RdRp complex formation and inhibit IAV replication. Thus, our studies not only identify SERTAD3 as an antiviral ISG, but also provide the mechanism of potential application of SERTAD3-derived peptide in suppressing influenza replication.

33176151	Transcription factor EB (TFEB) activates lysosomal biogenesis genes in response to environmental cues. Given implications of impaired TFEB signaling and lysosomal dysfunction in metabolic, neurological, and infectious diseases, we aim to systematically identify TFEB-directed circuits by examining transcriptional responses to TFEB subcellular localization and stimulation. We reveal that steady-state nuclear TFEB is sufficient to activate transcription of lysosomal, autophagy, and innate immunity genes, whereas other targets require higher thresholds of stimulation. Furthermore, we identify shared and distinct transcriptional signatures between mTOR inhibition and bacterial autophagy. Using a genome-wide CRISPR library, we find TFEB targets that protect cells from or sensitize cells to lysosomal cell death. BHLHE40 and BHLHE41, genes responsive to high, sustained levels of nuclear TFEB, act in opposition to TFEB upon lysosomal cell death induction. Further investigation identifies genes counter-regulated by TFEB and BHLHE40/41, adding this negative feedback to the current understanding of TFEB regulatory mechanisms.

33176146	Tissue injury is one of the most severe environmental perturbations for a living organism. When damage occurs in adult Drosophila, there is a local response of the injured tissue and a coordinated action across different tissues to help the organism overcome the deleterious effect of an injury. We show a change in the transcriptome of hemocytes at the site of tissue injury, with pronounced activation of the Toll signaling pathway. We find that induction of the cytokine upd-3 and Toll receptor activation occur in response to injury alone, in the absence of a pathogen. Intracellular accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in hemocytes is essential for upd-3 induction and is facilitated by the diffusion of hydrogen peroxide through a channel protein Prip. Importantly, hemocyte activation and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the site of a sterile injury provide protection to flies on subsequent infection, demonstrating training of the innate immune system.

33176142	Cilia are microtubule-based organelles that function in a multitude of physiological contexts to perform chemosensing, mechanosensing, and fluid propulsion. The process of ciliogenesis is highly regulated, and disruptions result in disease states termed ciliopathies. Here, we report that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1 alpha (ppargc1a) is essential for ciliogenesis in nodal, mono-, and multiciliated cells (MCCs) and for discernment of renal tubule ciliated cell fate during embryogenesis. ppargc1a performs these functions by affecting prostaglandin signaling, whereby cilia formation and renal MCC fate are restored with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) treatment in ppargc1a-deficient animals. Genetic disruption of ppargc1a specifically reduces expression of the prostanoid biosynthesis gene prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 (ptgs1), and suboptimal knockdown of both genes shows this synergistic effect. Furthermore, ptgs1 overexpression rescues ciliogenesis and renal MCCs in ppargc1a-deficient embryos. These findings position Ppargc1a as a key genetic regulator of prostaglandin signaling during ciliated cell ontogeny.

33176141	Nerve injury in somatosensory pathways may lead to neuropathic pain, which affects the life quality of approximately 8% of people. Long-term enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission along somatosensory pathways contributes to neuropathic pain. Caspase 3 (Casp3) plays a non-apoptotic role in the hippocampus and regulates internalization of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) subunits. Whether Casp3-AMPAR interaction is involved in the maintenance of peripheral hypersensitivity after nerve injury remained unknown. Here, we show that nerve injury suppresses long-term depression (LTD) and downregulates Casp3 in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Interfering with interactions between Casp3 and AMPAR subunits or reducing Casp3 activity in the ACC suppresses LTD induction and causes peripheral hypersensitivity. Overexpression of Casp3 restores LTD and reduces peripheral hypersensitivity after nerve injury. We reveal how Casp3 is involved in the maintenance of peripheral hypersensitivity. Our findings suggest that restoration of LTD via Casp3 provides a therapeutic strategy for neuropathic pain management.

33207204	The balance of phospho-signaling at the outer kinetochore is critical for forming accurate attachments between kinetochores and the mitotic spindle and timely exit from mitosis. A major player in determining this balance is the PP2A-B56 phosphatase, which is recruited to the kinase attachment regulatory domain (KARD) of budding uninhibited by benzimidazole 1-related 1 (BUBR1) in a phospho-dependent manner. This unleashes a rapid, switch-like phosphatase relay that reverses mitotic phosphorylation at the kinetochore, extinguishing the checkpoint and promoting anaphase. Here, we demonstrate that the C-terminal pseudokinase domain of human BUBR1 is required to promote KARD phosphorylation. Mutation or removal of the pseudokinase domain results in decreased PP2A-B56 recruitment to the outer kinetochore attenuated checkpoint silencing and errors in chromosome alignment as a result of imbalance in Aurora B activity. Our data, therefore, elucidate a function for the BUBR1 pseudokinase domain in ensuring accurate and timely exit from mitosis.

33207203	The Drosophila midgut is an excellent system for characterizing cell cycle regulation in the context of tissue homeostasis. Two major progenitor cell types populate the midgut: mitotic intestinal stem cells and their post-mitotic daughters, enteroblasts. Although regulatory networks that control stem cell proliferation are well characterized, how enteroblast mitotic-cell-cycle exit is coordinated with endocycle entry and enterocyte specification remains poorly defined. Myt1 is a conserved Cdk1 inhibitory kinase that regulates mitotic timing during animal development. Here, we use myt1-null mutants and cell-specific RNA interference to investigate Myt1 function in stem cells and enteroblast progenitors. Myt1 depletion alters cell cycle kinetics and promotes ectopic stem cell and enteroblast mitoses at the expense of enteroblast-enterocyte differentiation. These aberrant enteroblast mitoses rely upon cyclin A, implicating Myt1 inhibition of cyclin A/Cdk1 as a mechanism for the coupling mitotic exit with differentiation in enteroblasts.

33207199	After optic nerve crush (ONC), the cell bodies and distal axons of most retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) degenerate. RGC somal and distal axon degenerations were previously thought to be controlled by two parallel pathways, involving activation of the kinase dual leucine-zipper kinase (DLK) and loss of the axon survival factor nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase-2 (NMNAT2), respectively. Here, we report that palmitoylation of both DLK and NMNAT2 by the palmitoyl acyltransferase ZDHHC17 couples these signals. ZDHHC17-dependent palmitoylation enables DLK-dependent somal degeneration after ONC and also ensures NMNAT-dependent distal axon integrity in healthy optic nerves. We provide evidence that ZDHHC17 also controls survival-versus-degeneration decisions in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, and we identify conserved motifs in NMNAT2 and DLK that govern their ZDHHC17-dependent regulation. These findings suggest that the control of somal and distal axon integrity should be considered as a single, holistic process, mediated by the concerted action of two palmitoylation-dependent pathways.

33207196	Stressful experiences early in life can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. However, it remains largely unknown how stress influences susceptibility to the disease onset. Here, we show that exposure to brain-processed stress disrupts myocardial growth by reducing cardiomyocyte mitotic activity. Activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the primary stress response pathway, reduces cardiomyocyte numbers, disrupts trabecular formation, and leads to contractile dysfunction of the developing myocardium. However, a physiological level of GR signaling is required to prevent cardiomyocyte hyperproliferation. Mechanistically, we identify an antagonistic interaction between the GR and the cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) as a key player in cardiac development. IL-4 signals transcription of key regulators of cell-cycle progression in cardiomyocytes via signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3). GR, on the contrary, inhibits this signaling system. Thus, our findings uncover an interplay between stress and immune signaling pathways critical to orchestrating physiological growth of the heart.

33238123	Interleukin-27 (IL-27) is an immunoregulatory cytokine that suppresses inflammation through multiple mechanisms, including induction of IL-10, but the transcriptional network mediating its diverse functions remains unclear. Combining temporal RNA profiling with computational algorithms, we predict 79 transcription factors induced by IL-27 in T cells. We validate 11 known and discover 5 positive (Cebpb, Fosl2, Tbx21, Hlx, and Atf3) and 2 negative (Irf9 and Irf8) Il10 regulators, generating an experimentally refined regulatory network for Il10. We report two central regulators, Prdm1 and Maf, that cooperatively drive the expression of signature genes induced by IL-27 in type 1 regulatory T cells, mediate IL-10 expression in all T helper cells, and determine the regulatory phenotype of colonic Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells.

33238122	Gene expression is controlled by the collective binding of transcription factors to cis-regulatory regions. Deciphering gene-centered regulatory networks is vital to understanding and controlling gene misexpression in human disease; however, systematic approaches to uncovering regulatory networks have been lacking. Here we present high-throughput interrogation of gene-centered activation networks (HIGAN), a pipeline that employs a suite of multifaceted genomic approaches to connect upstream signaling inputs, trans-acting TFs, and cis-regulatory elements. We apply HIGAN to understand the aberrant activation of the cytidine deaminase APOBEC3B, an intrinsic source of cancer hypermutation. We reveal that nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and AP-1 pathways are the most salient trans-acting inputs, with minor roles for other inflammatory pathways. We identify a cis-regulatory architecture dominated by a major intronic enhancer that requires coordinated NF-kappaB and AP-1 activity with secondary inputs from distal regulatory regions. Our data demonstrate how integration of cis and trans genomic screening platforms provides a paradigm for building gene-centered regulatory networks.

33264621	The widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are derivatives of the phytohormone salicylic acid (SA). SA is well known to regulate plant immunity and development, whereas there have been few reports focusing on the effects of NSAIDs in plants. Our studies here reveal that NSAIDs exhibit largely overlapping physiological activities to SA in the model plant Arabidopsis. NSAID treatments lead to shorter and agravitropic primary roots and inhibited lateral root organogenesis. Notably, in addition to the SA-like action, which in roots involves binding to the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), NSAIDs also exhibit PP2A-independent effects. Cell biological and biochemical analyses reveal that many NSAIDs bind directly to and inhibit the chaperone activity of TWISTED DWARF1, thereby regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics and subsequent endosomal trafficking. Our findings uncover an unexpected bioactivity of human pharmaceuticals in plants and provide insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the cellular action of this class of anti-inflammatory compounds.

33296645	Ferroptosis is a recently discovered form of programed cell death caused by the metabolically regulated lipid peroxidation and holds promise for cancer treatment, but its regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we observe that lactate-rich liver cancer cells exhibit enhanced resistance to the ferroptotic damage induced by common ferroptosis inducers such as Ras-selective lethal small molecule 3 (RSL3) and Erastin and that the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)-mediated lactate uptake could promote ATP production in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and deactivate the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading to the upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and the downstream stearoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase-1 (SCD1) to enhance the production of anti-ferroptosis monounsaturated fatty acids. Additionally, blocking the lactate uptake via hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1)/MCT1 inhibition promotes ferroptosis by activating the AMPK to downregulate SCD1, which may synergize with its acyl-coenzyme A synthetase 4 (ACSL4)-promoting effect to amplify the ferroptotic susceptibility. In vitro and in vivo evidence confirms that lactate regulates the ferroptosis of HCC cells and highlights its translational potential as a therapeutic target for ferroptosis-based tumor treatment.

33326784	Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes with the capacity to elicit adaptive features, including clonal expansion and immunological memory. Because signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) is essential for NK cell development, the roles of this transcription factor and its upstream cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-15 during infection have not been carefully investigated. In this study, we investigate how STAT5 regulates transcription during viral infection. We demonstrate that STAT5 is induced in NK cells by IL-12 and STAT4 early after infection and that partial STAT5 deficiency results in a defective capacity of NK cells to generate long-lived memory cells. Furthermore, we find a functional dichotomy of IL-2 and IL-15 signaling outputs during viral infection, whereby both cytokines drive clonal expansion, but only IL-15 is required for memory NK cell survival. We thus highlight a role for STAT5 signaling in promoting an optimal anti-viral NK cell response.	Divergent Role for STAT5 in the Adaptive Responses of Natural Killer Cells.	Cell reports	1
33357432	DNA damage tolerance (DDT) and homologous recombination (HR) stabilize replication forks (RFs). RAD18/UBC13/three prime repair exonuclease 2 (TREX2)-mediated proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) ubiquitination is central to DDT, an error-prone lesion bypass pathway. RAD51 is the recombinase for HR. The RAD51 K133A mutation increased spontaneous mutations and stress-induced RF stalls and nascent strand degradation. Here, we report in RAD51(K133A) cells that this phenotype is reduced by expressing a TREX2 H188A mutation that deletes its exonuclease activity. In RAD51(K133A) cells, knocking out RAD18 or overexpressing PCNA reduces spontaneous mutations, while expressing ubiquitination-incompetent PCNA(K164)(R) increases mutations, indicating DDT as causal. Deleting TREX2 in cells deficient for the RF maintenance proteins poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) or FANCB increased nascent strand degradation that was rescued by TREX2(H188A), implying that TREX2 prohibits degradation independent of catalytic activity. A possible explanation for this occurrence is that TREX2(H188A) associates with UBC13 and ubiquitinates PCNA, suggesting a dual role for TREX2 in RF maintenance.

33357430	During chronic infection, the inflammatory cytokine interferon gamma (IFNgamma) damages hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by disrupting quiescence and promoting excessive terminal differentiation. However, the mechanism by which IFNgamma hinders HSC quiescence remains undefined. Using intravital 3-dimensional microscopy, we find that IFNgamma disrupts the normally close interaction between HSCs and CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells in the HSC niche. IFNgamma stimulation increases expression of the cell surface protein BST2, which we find is required for IFNgamma-dependent HSC relocalization and activation. IFNgamma stimulation of HSCs increases their E-selectin binding by BST2 and homing to the bone marrow, which depends on E-selectin binding. Upon chronic infection, HSCs from mice lacking BST2 are more quiescent and more resistant to depletion than HSCs from wild-type mice. Overall, this study defines a critical mechanism by which IFNgamma promotes niche relocalization and activation in response to inflammatory stimulation and identifies BST2 as a key regulator of HSC quiescence.

33406424	The cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) is a key DNA sensor that initiates STING-dependent signaling to produce type I interferons through synthesizing the secondary messenger 2'3'-cGAMP. In this study, we confirm previous studies showing that cGAS is located both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Nuclear accumulation is observed when leptomycin B is used to block the exportin, CRM1 protein. As a result, leptomycin B impairs the production of interferons in response to DNA stimulation. We further identify a functional nuclear export signal (NES) in cGAS, (169)LEKLKL(174). Mutating this NES leads to the sequestration of cGAS within the nucleus and the loss of interferon response to cytosolic DNA treatment, and it further determines the key amino acid to L172. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the cytosolic DNA-sensing function of cGAS depends on its presence within the cytoplasm, which is warranted by a functional NES.

33406421	O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) is a unique enzyme introducing O-GlcNAc moiety on target proteins, and it critically regulates various cellular processes in diverse cell types. However, its roles in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) remain elusive. Here, using Ogt conditional knockout mice, we show that OGT is essential for HSPCs. Ogt is highly expressed in HSPCs, and its disruption induces rapid loss of HSPCs with increased reactive oxygen species and apoptosis. In particular, Ogt-deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) lose quiescence, cannot be maintained in vivo, and become vulnerable to regenerative and competitive stress. Interestingly, Ogt-deficient HSCs accumulate defective mitochondria due to impaired mitophagy with decreased key mitophagy regulator, Pink1, through dysregulation of H3K4me3. Furthermore, overexpression of PINK1 restores mitophagy and the number of Ogt-deficient HSCs. Collectively, our results reveal that OGT critically regulates maintenance and stress response of HSCs by ensuring mitochondrial quality through PINK1-dependent mitophagy.

33406418	The zinc finger transcription factor SALL4 is highly expressed in embryonic stem cells, downregulated in most adult tissues, but reactivated in many aggressive cancers. This unique expression pattern makes SALL4 an attractive therapeutic target. However, whether SALL4 binds DNA directly to regulate gene expression is unclear, and many of its targets in cancer cells remain elusive. Here, through an unbiased screen of protein binding microarray (PBM) and cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN) experiments, we identify and validate the DNA binding domain of SALL4 and its consensus binding sequence. Combined with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses after SALL4 knockdown, we discover hundreds of new SALL4 target genes that it directly regulates in aggressive liver cancer cells, including genes encoding a family of histone 3 lysine 9-specific demethylases (KDMs). Taken together, these results elucidate the mechanism of SALL4 DNA binding and reveal pathways and molecules to target in SALL4-dependent tumors.

33440163	Anterior segment dysgenesis is often associated with cornea diseases, cataracts, and glaucoma. In the anterior segment, the ciliary body (CB) containing inner and outer ciliary epithelia (ICE and OCE) secretes aqueous humor that maintains intraocular pressure (IOP). However, CB development and function remain poorly understood. Here, this study shows that NOTCH signaling in the CB maintains the vitreous, IOP, and eye structures by regulating CB morphogenesis, aqueous humor secretion, and vitreous protein expression. Notch2 and Notch3 function via RBPJ in the CB to control ICE-OCE adhesion, CB morphogenesis, aqueous humor secretion, and protein expression, thus maintaining IOP and eye structures. Mechanistically, NOTCH signaling transcriptionally controls Nectin1 expression in the OCE to promote cell adhesion for driving CB morphogenesis and to directly stabilize Cx43 for controlling aqueous humor secretion. Finally, NOTCH signaling directly controls vitreous protein secretion in the ICE. Therefore, this study provides important insight into CB functions and involvement in eye diseases.

33440148	Recent studies have profiled the innate immune signatures in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and suggest that cellular responses to viral challenge may affect disease severity. Yet the molecular events that underlie cellular recognition and response to SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be elucidated. Here, we find that SARS-CoV-2 replication induces a delayed interferon (IFN) response in lung epithelial cells. By screening 16 putative sensors involved in sensing of RNA virus infection, we found that MDA5 and LGP2 primarily regulate IFN induction in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further analyses revealed that viral intermediates specifically activate the IFN response through MDA5-mediated sensing. Additionally, we find that IRF3, IRF5, and NF-kappaB/p65 are the key transcription factors regulating the IFN response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In summary, these findings provide critical insights into the molecular basis of the innate immune recognition and signaling response to SARS-CoV-2.

33503431	Replication stress response ensures impediments to DNA replication do not compromise replication fork stability and genome integrity. In a process termed replication fork protection, newly synthesized DNA at stalled replication forks is stabilized and protected from nuclease-mediated degradation. We report the identification of DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor 14 (DCAF14), a substrate receptor for Cullin4-RING E3 ligase (CRL4) complex, integral in stabilizing stalled replication forks. DCAF14 localizes rapidly to stalled forks and promotes genome integrity by preventing fork collapse into double-strand breaks (DSBs). Importantly, CRL4(DCAF14) mediates stalled fork protection in a RAD51-dependent manner to protect nascent DNA from MRE11 and DNA2 nucleases. Thus, our study shows replication stress response functions of DCAF14 in genome maintenance.	DCAF14 promotes stalled fork stability to maintain genome integrity.	Cell reports	0
33535043	TCF1 plays a critical role in T lineage commitment and the development of alphabeta lineage T cells, but its role in gammadelta T cell development remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal a regulatory axis where T cell receptor (TCR) signaling controls TCF1 expression through an E-protein-bound regulatory element in the Tcf7 locus, and this axis regulates both gammadelta T lineage commitment and effector fate. Indeed, the level of TCF1 expression plays an important role in setting the threshold for gammadelta T lineage commitment and modulates the ability of TCR signaling to influence effector fate adoption by gammadelta T lineage progenitors. This finding provides mechanistic insight into how TCR-mediated repression of E proteins promotes the development of gammadelta T cells and their adoption of the interleukin (IL)-17-producing effector fate. IL-17-producing gammadelta T cells have been implicated in cancer progression and in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and multiple sclerosis.

33596428	AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an energy sensor that plays roles in multiple biological processes beyond metabolism. Several studies have suggested that AMPK is involved in the DNA damage response (DDR), but the mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that AMPK promotes classic non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ) in double-strand break (DSB) repair through recruiting a key chromatin-based mediator named p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1), which facilitates the end joining of distal DNA ends during DDR. We find that the interaction of AMPK and 53BP1 spatially occurs under DSB stress. In the context of DSBs, AMPK directly phosphorylates 53BP1 at Ser1317 and promotes 53BP1 recruitment during DDR for an efficient c-NHEJ, thus maintaining genomic stability and diversity of the immune repertoire. Taken together, our study demonstrates that AMPK is a regulator of 53BP1 and controls c-NHEJ choice by phospho-regulation.	AMPK-mediated phosphorylation on 53BP1 promotes c-NHEJ.	Cell reports	0
33596426	Mossy cells (MCs) are a unique group of excitatory neurons in the hippocampus, a brain region important for emotion, learning, and memory. Due to the lack of a reliable method to isolate MCs from other cell types, how MCs integrate neural information and convey it to their synaptic targets for engaging a specific function are still unknown. Here, we report that MCs control the efficacy of spatial memory retrieval by synapsing directly onto local somatostatin-expressing (SST) cells. MC-SST synaptic transmission undergoes long-term potentiation (LTP), requiring Gria2-lacking Ca(2+)-permeable anti-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor (Ca(2+)AR). A long noncoding RNA (Gria2I) is associated with Gria2 transcriptional repressors in SST cells. Silencing Gria2I induces Gria2 transcription, blocks LTP of MCs-SST synaptic transmission, and reduces the efficacy of memory retrieval. Thus, MCs directly and functionally innervate local SST neurons, and this innervation controls the efficacy of spatial memory retrieval by Gria2I inhibition of Gria2 transcription.	A circuit of mossy cells controls the efficacy of memory retrieval by Gria2I inhibition of Gria2.	Cell reports	1
33596425	The intestine is under constant exposure to chemicals, antigens, and microorganisms from the external environment. Apical aspects of transporting epithelial cells (enterocytes) form a brush-border membrane (BBM), shaped by packed microvilli coated with a dense glycocalyx. We present evidence showing that the glycocalyx forms an epithelial barrier that prevents exogenous molecules and live bacteria from gaining access to BBM. We use a multi-omics approach to investigate the function and regulation of membrane mucins exposed on the BBM during postnatal development of the mouse small intestine. Muc17 is identified as a major membrane mucin in the glycocalyx that is specifically upregulated by IL-22 as part of an epithelial defense repertoire during weaning. High levels of IL-22 at time of weaning reprogram neonatal postmitotic progenitor enterocytes to differentiate into Muc17-expressing enterocytes, as found in the adult intestine during homeostasis. Our findings propose a role for Muc17 in epithelial barrier function in the small intestine.	IL-22 promotes the formation of a MUC17 glycocalyx barrier in the postnatal small intestine during weaning.	Cell reports	1
33626359	Estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) drives tumor development in ER-positive (ER+) breast cancer. The transcription factor GATA3 has been closely linked to ER function, but its precise role in this setting remains unclear. Quantitative proteomics was used to assess changes to the ER complex in response to GATA3 depletion. Unexpectedly, few proteins were lost from the ER complex in the absence of GATA3, with the only major change being depletion of the dioxygenase TET2. TET2 binding constituted a near-total subset of ER binding in multiple breast cancer models, with loss of TET2 associated with reduced activation of proliferative pathways. TET2 knockdown did not appear to change global methylated cytosine (5mC) levels; however, oxidation of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) was significantly reduced, and these events occurred at ER enhancers. These findings implicate TET2 in the maintenance of 5hmC at ER sites, providing a potential mechanism for TET2-mediated regulation of ER target genes.	TET2 is a component of the estrogen receptor complex and controls 5mC to 5hmC conversion at estrogen receptor cis-regulatory regions.	Cell reports	1
33626345	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide. One major obstacle to treatment is a lack of effective molecular-targeted therapies. In this study, we find that EphA2 expression and signaling are enriched in human HCC and associated with poor prognosis. Loss of EphA2 suppresses the initiation and growth of HCC both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, CRISPR/CAS9-mediated EphA2 inhibition significantly delays tumor development in a genetically engineered murine model of HCC. Mechanistically, we discover that targeting EphA2 suppresses both AKT and JAK1/STAT3 signaling, two separate oncogenic pathways in HCC. We also identify a small molecule kinase inhibitor of EphA2 that suppresses tumor progression in a murine HCC model. Together, our results suggest EphA2 as a promising therapeutic target for HCC.

33691110	MED1 (mediator subunit 1) co-amplifies with HER2, but its role in HER2-driven mammary tumorigenesis is still unknown. Here, we generate MED1 mammary-specific overexpression mice and cross them with mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-HER2 mice. We observe significantly promoted onset, growth, metastasis, and multiplicity of HER2 tumors by MED1 overexpression. Further studies reveal critical roles for MED1 in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cancer stem cell formation, and response to anti-HER2 therapy. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) transcriptome analyses and clinical sample correlation studies identify Jab1, a component of the COP9 signalosome complex, as the key direct target gene of MED1 contributing to these processes. Further studies reveal that Jab1 can also reciprocally regulate the stability and transcriptional activity of MED1. Together, our findings support a functional cooperation between these co-amplified genes in HER2(+) mammary tumorigenesis and their potential usage as therapeutic targets for the treatment of HER2(+) breast cancers.	Functional cooperation between co-amplified genes promotes aggressive phenotypes of HER2-positive breast cancer.	Cell reports	0
33691099	Calcium transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to mitochondria is a critical contributor to apoptosis. B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) ovarian killer (BOK) localizes to the ER and binds the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosophate receptor (IP3R). Here, we show that BOK is necessary for baseline mitochondrial calcium levels and stimulus-induced calcium transfer from the ER to the mitochondria. Murine embryonic fibroblasts deficient for BOK have decreased proximity of the ER to the mitochondria and altered protein composition of mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), which form essential calcium microdomains. Rescue of the ER-mitochondrial juxtaposition with drug-inducible interorganelle linkers reveals a kinetic disruption, which when overcome in Bok(-/-) cells is still insufficient to rescue thapsigargin-induced calcium transfer and apoptosis. Likewise, a BOK mutant unable to interact with IP3R restores ER-mitochondrial proximity, but not ER-mitochondrial calcium transfer, MAM protein composition, or apoptosis. This work identifies the dynamic coordination of ER-mitochondrial contact by BOK as an important control point for apoptosis.

33730589	Senescent cells trigger their own immune-mediated destruction, termed senescence surveillance. This is dependent on the inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which includes COX2, an enzyme with complex roles in cancer. The role COX2 plays during senescence surveillance is unknown. Here, we show that during RAS-induced senescence (RIS), COX2 is a critical regulator of SASP composition and senescence surveillance in vivo. COX2 regulates the expression of multiple inflammatory SASP components through an autocrine feedback loop involving its downstream product, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), binding to EP4. During in vivo hepatocyte RIS, Cox2 is critical to tumor suppression, Cxcl1 expression, and immune-mediated senescence surveillance, partially through PGE2. Loss of Cox2 in RIS dysregulates the intrahepatic immune microenvironment, with enrichment of immunosuppressive immature myeloid cells and CD4(+) regulatory T lymphocytes. Therefore, COX2 and PGE2 play a critical role in senescence, shaping SASP composition, promoting senescence surveillance and tumor suppression in the earliest stages of tumorigenesis.

33761345	Tonic inhibition mediated by extrasynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs) critically regulates neuronal excitability and brain function. However, the mechanisms regulating tonic inhibition remain poorly understood. Here, we report that Shisa7 is critical for tonic inhibition regulation in hippocampal neurons. In juvenile Shisa7 knockout (KO) mice, alpha5-GABAAR-mediated tonic currents are significantly reduced. Mechanistically, Shisa7 is crucial for alpha5-GABAAR exocytosis. Additionally, Shisa7 regulation of tonic inhibition requires protein kinase A (PKA) that phosphorylates Shisa7 serine 405 (S405). Importantly, tonic inhibition undergoes activity-dependent regulation, and Shisa7 is required for homeostatic potentiation of tonic inhibition. Interestingly, in young adult Shisa7 KOs, basal tonic inhibition in hippocampal neurons is unaltered, largely due to the diminished alpha5-GABAAR component of tonic inhibition. However, at this stage, tonic inhibition oscillates during the daily sleep/wake cycle, a process requiring Shisa7. Together, these data demonstrate that intricate signaling mechanisms regulate tonic inhibition at different developmental stages and reveal a molecular link between sleep and tonic inhibition.

33789105	Ogt catalyzed O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAcylation, O-GlcNAc) plays an important function in diverse biological processes and diseases. However, the roles of Ogt in regulating neurogenesis remain largely unknown. Here, we show that Ogt deficiency or depletion in adult neural stem/progenitor cells (aNSPCs) leads to the diminishment of the aNSPC pool and aberrant neurogenesis and consequently impairs cognitive function in adult mice. RNA sequencing reveals that Ogt deficiency alters the transcription of genes relating to cell cycle, neurogenesis, and neuronal development. Mechanistic studies show that Ogt directly interacts with Notch1 and catalyzes the O-GlcNAc modification of Notch TM/ICD fragment. Decreased O-GlcNAc modification of TM/ICD increases the binding of E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch to TM/ICD and promotes its degradation. Itch knockdown rescues neurogenic defects induced by Ogt deficiency in vitro and in vivo. Our findings reveal the essential roles and mechanisms of Ogt and O-GlcNAc modification in regulating mammalian neurogenesis and cognition.

33910004	Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) family ligands are key regulators of dendritic cell (DC) differentiation and activation. Epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) require TGF-beta family signaling for their differentiation, and canonical TGF-beta1 signaling secures a non-activated LC state. LCs reportedly control skin inflammation and are replenished from peripheral blood monocytes, which also give rise to pro-inflammatory monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs). By studying mechanisms in inflammation, we previously screened LCs versus moDCs for differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs). This revealed that miR-424/503 is the most strongly inversely regulated (moDCs > LCs). We here demonstrate that miR-424/503 is induced during moDC differentiation and promotes moDC differentiation in human and mouse. Inversely, forced repression of miR-424 during moDC differentiation facilitates TGF-beta1-dependent LC differentiation. Mechanistically, miR-424/503 deficiency in monocyte/DC precursors leads to the induction of TGF-beta1 response genes critical for LC differentiation. Therefore, the miR-424/503 gene cluster plays a decisive role in anti-inflammatory LC versus pro-inflammatory moDC differentiation from monocytes.	The miR-424(322)/503 gene cluster regulates pro- versus anti-inflammatory skin DC subset differentiation by modulating TGF-beta signaling.	Cell reports	0
33910002	MYC-driven medulloblastoma is a major therapeutic challenge due to frequent metastasis and a poor 5-year survival rate. MYC gene amplification results in transcriptional dysregulation, proliferation, and survival of malignant cells. To identify therapeutic targets in MYC-amplified medulloblastoma, we employ a CRISPR-Cas9 essentiality screen targeting 1,140 genes. We identify CDK7 as a mediator of medulloblastoma tumorigenesis. Using chemical inhibitors and genetic depletion, we observe cessation of tumor growth in xenograft mouse models and increases in apoptosis. The results are attributed to repression of a core set of MYC-driven transcriptional programs mediating DNA repair. CDK7 inhibition alters RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) and MYC association at DNA repair genes. Blocking CDK7 activity sensitizes cells to ionizing radiation leading to accrual of DNA damage, extending survival and tumor latency in xenograft mouse models. Our studies establish the selective inhibition of MYC-driven medulloblastoma by CDK7 inhibition combined with radiation as a viable therapeutic strategy.	Transcriptional control of DNA repair networks by CDK7 regulates sensitivity to radiation in MYC-driven medulloblastoma.	Cell reports	1
33979619	Differentiation and homeostasis of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) are tightly controlled by the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) signaling, yet the mechanisms governing these processes are incompletely understood. Here, we report that transcription factor Bach2 attenuates IL-2R signaling to coordinate Treg differentiation and homeostasis. Bach2 is required for the quiescence, survival, and maintenance of resting Treg cells (rTregs). Unexpectedly, Bach2 directly represses CD25 (IL-2Ralpha) and subsequently attenuates IL-2R signaling in Tregs. Upregulated CD25/IL-2R signaling in Bach2-deficient rTregs acts as a parallel pathway to partially counteract their poor survival and maintenance. Furthermore, Bach2 suppresses CD25/IL-2R signaling in T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells. Bach2 deficiency in Tregs prevents the formation of highly differentiated Tfr cells, associated with aberrant GC response. Finally, a mild and late onset of autoimmune disease is observed in mice with Bach2-deficient Tregs. Thus, Bach2 balances IL-2R signaling to orchestrate development and homeostasis of various Treg subsets.	Bach2 attenuates IL-2R signaling to control Treg homeostasis and Tfr development.

33979616	Depleting the microenvironment of important nutrients such as arginine is a key strategy for immune evasion by cancer cells. Many tumors overexpress arginase, but it is unclear how these cancers, but not T cells, tolerate arginine depletion. In this study, we show that tumor cells synthesize arginine from citrulline by upregulating argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1). Under arginine starvation, ASS1 transcription is induced by ATF4 and CEBPbeta binding to an enhancer within ASS1. T cells cannot induce ASS1, despite the presence of active ATF4 and CEBPbeta, as the gene is repressed. Arginine starvation drives global chromatin compaction and repressive histone methylation, which disrupts ATF4/CEBPbeta binding and target gene transcription. We find that T cell activation is impaired in arginine-depleted conditions, with significant metabolic perturbation linked to incomplete chromatin remodeling and misregulation of key genes. Our results highlight a T cell behavior mediated by nutritional stress, exploited by cancer cells to enable pathological immune evasion.	Chromatin accessibility governs the differential response of cancer and T cells to arginine starvation.	Cell reports	0
33979615	Dicotyledonous plants form an apical hook to protect the fragile apical meristem during upward protrusion from the soil. Etiolated pifq (pif1 pif3 pif4 pif5) seedlings display constitutive apical hook opening. Here, we show that PIF proteins control apical hook opening by regulating the expression of Budding Uninhibited by Benzimidazole 3.1 (BUB3.1) and affecting cytokinesis. Consistent with the major function of BUB3.1 in the organization of phragmoplasts during cytokinesis, the phragmoplasts are well formed in dark-grown pifq but not in wild type. DNA staining and flow cytometry analysis further demonstrate that cellular endoreduplication levels are dramatically reduced in pifq. Chemical treatment with caffeine, an inhibitor of phragmoplast-based cytokinesis, shows that cytokinesis is involved in the apical hook opening. Genetically, BUB3.1 is epistatic to PIFq in the regulation of cytokinesis. Our findings reveal an organ-specific role of PIF proteins in regulating cytokinesis by BUB3.1 during apical hook development.

33979606	Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a debilitating neurological disorder marked by degeneration of spinal motor neurons and muscle atrophy. SMA results from mutations in survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1), leading to deficiency of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Current therapies increase SMN protein and improve patient survival but have variable improvements in motor function, making it necessary to identify complementary strategies to further improve disease outcomes. Here, we perform a genome-wide RNAi screen using a luciferase-based activity reporter and identify genes involved in regulating SMN gene expression, RNA processing, and protein stability. We show that reduced expression of Transcription Export complex components increases SMN levels through the regulation of nuclear/cytoplasmic RNA transport. We also show that the E3 ligase, Neurl2, works cooperatively with Mib1 to ubiquitinate and promote SMN degradation. Together, our screen uncovers pathways through which SMN expression is regulated, potentially revealing additional strategies to treat SMA.

34010655	During influenza A epidemics, bacterial coinfection is a major cause of increased morbidity and mortality. However, the roles of host factors in regulating influenza A virus (IAV)-triggered bacterial coinfection remain elusive. Cyclophilin A (CypA) is an important regulator of infection and immunity. Here, we show that IAV-induced CypA expression facilitates group A Streptococcus (GAS) coinfection both in vitro and in vivo. Upon IAV infection, CypA interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and inhibited E3 ligase cCbl-mediated, K48-linked ubiquitination of FAK, which positively regulates integrin alpha5 expression and actin rearrangement via the FAK/Akt signaling pathway to facilitate GAS colonization and invasion. Notably, CypA deficiency or inhibition by cyclosporine A significantly inhibits IAV-triggered GAS coinfection in mice. Collectively, these findings reveal that CypA is critical for GAS infection, and induction of CypA expression is another way for IAV to promote bacterial coinfection, suggesting that CypA is a promising therapeutic target for the secondary bacterial infection.

34010649	Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles subjected to fission and fusion events. During mitosis, mitochondrial fission ensures equal distribution of mitochondria to daughter cells. If and how this process can actively drive mitotic progression remains largely unknown. Here, we discover a pathway linking mitochondrial fission to mitotic progression in mammalian cells. The mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), the main mitochondrial receptor for the Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), is directly phosphorylated by Protein Kinase D (PKD) specifically during mitosis. PKD-dependent MFF phosphorylation is required and sufficient for mitochondrial fission in mitotic but not in interphasic cells. Phosphorylation of MFF is crucial for chromosome segregation and promotes cell survival by inhibiting adaptation of the mitotic checkpoint. Thus, PKD/MFF-dependent mitochondrial fission is critical for the maintenance of genome integrity during cell division.	A PKD-MFF signaling axis couples mitochondrial fission to mitotic progression.

34010646	Organismal stressors such as cold exposure require a systemic response to maintain body temperature. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a key thermogenic tissue in mammals that protects against hypothermia in response to cold exposure. Defining the complex interplay of multiple organ systems in this response is fundamental to our understanding of adipose tissue thermogenesis. In this study, we identify a role for hepatic insulin signaling via AKT in the adaptive response to cold stress and show that liver AKT is an essential cell-nonautonomous regulator of adipocyte lipolysis and BAT function. Mechanistically, inhibition of forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) by AKT controls BAT thermogenesis by enhancing catecholamine-induced lipolysis in the white adipose tissue (WAT) and increasing circulating fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). Our data identify a role for hepatic insulin signaling via the AKT-FOXO1 axis in regulating WAT lipolysis, promoting BAT thermogenic capacity, and ensuring a proper thermogenic response to acute cold exposure.	Hepatic AKT orchestrates adipose tissue thermogenesis via FGF21-dependent and -independent mechanisms.	Cell reports	0
34010639	The cyclic AMP pathway promotes melanocyte differentiation by activating CREB and the cAMP-regulated transcription co-activators 1-3 (CRTC1-3). Differentiation is dysregulated in melanomas, although the contributions of CRTC proteins is unclear. We report a selective differentiation impairment in CRTC3 KO melanocytes and melanoma cells, due to downregulation of oculo-cutaneous albinism II (OCA2) and block of melanosome maturation. CRTC3 stimulates OCA2 expression by binding to CREB on a conserved enhancer, a regulatory site for pigmentation and melanoma risk. CRTC3 is uniquely activated by ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation at Ser391 and by low levels of cAMP. Phosphorylation at Ser391 is constitutively elevated in human melanoma cells with hyperactivated ERK1/2 signaling; knockout of CRTC3 in this setting impairs anchorage-independent growth, migration, and invasiveness, whereas CRTC3 overexpression supports cell survival in response to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor vemurafenib. As melanomas expressing gain-of-function mutations in CRTC3 are associated with reduced survival, our results suggest that CRTC3 inhibition may provide therapeutic benefit in this setting.

34010636	The hippocampus is one of two niches in the mammalian brain with persistent neurogenesis into adulthood. The neurogenic capacity of hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) declines with age, but the molecular mechanisms of this process remain unknown. In this study, we find that fibroblast growth factor 13 (FGF13) is essential for the post-natal neurogenesis in mouse hippocampus, and FGF13 deficiency impairs learning and memory. In particular, we find that FGF13A, the nuclear isoform of FGF13, is involved in the maintenance of NSCs and the suppression of neuronal differentiation during post-natal hippocampal development. Furthermore, we find that FGF13A interacts with ARID1B, a unit of Brahma-associated factor chromatin remodeling complex, and suppresses the expression of neuron differentiation-associated genes through chromatin modification. Our results suggest that FGF13A is an important regulator for maintaining the self-renewal and neurogenic capacity of NSCs in post-natal hippocampus, revealing an epigenomic regulatory function of FGFs in neurogenesis.	Nuclear isoform of FGF13 regulates post-natal neurogenesis in the hippocampus through an epigenomic mechanism.	Cell reports	0
34038735	The ATPase p97 is a central component of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system. p97 uses its ATPase activity and co-factors to extract ubiquitinated substrates from different cellular locations, including DNA lesions, thereby regulating DNA repair pathway choice. Here, we find that p97 physically and functionally interacts with the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex on chromatin and that inactivation of p97 blocks the disassembly of the MRN complex from the sites of DNA damage upon ionizing radiation (IR). The inhibition of p97 function results in excessive 5'-DNA end resection mediated by MRE11 that leads to defective DNA repair and radiosensitivity. In addition, p97 inhibition by the specific small-molecule inhibitor CB-5083 increases tumor cell killing following IR both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, this is mediated via increased MRE11 nuclease accumulation. This suggests that p97 inhibitors might be exploited to improve outcomes for radiotherapy patients.	p97/VCP inhibition causes excessive MRE11-dependent DNA end resection promoting cell killing after ionizing radiation.

34038728	Increased vascular permeability and leakage are hallmarks of several pathologies and determine disease progression and severity by facilitating inflammatory/metastatic cell infiltration. Using tissue-specific genetic ablation in endothelial cells, we have investigated in vivo the role of Tumor progression locus 2 (Tpl2), a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) member with pleiotropic effects in inflammation and cancer. In response to proinflammatory stimuli, endothelial Tpl2 deletion alters tight junction claudin-5 protein expression through inhibition of JNK signaling and lysosomal degradation activation, resulting in reduced vascular permeability and immune cell infiltration. This results in significantly attenuated disease scores in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and fewer tumor nodules in a hematogenic lung cancer metastasis model. Accordingly, pharmacologic inhibition of Tpl2 or small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated Tpl2 knockdown recapitulates our findings and reduces lung metastatic tumor invasions. These results establish an endothelial-specific role for Tpl2 and highlight the therapeutic potential of blocking the endothelial-specific Tpl2 pathway in chronic inflammatory and metastatic diseases.

34077730	Pathological lipid accumulation is often associated with enhanced uptake of free fatty acids via specific transporters in cardiomyocytes. Here, we identify SIRT6 as a critical transcriptional regulator of fatty acid transporters in cardiomyocytes. We find that SIRT6 deficiency enhances the expression of fatty acid transporters, leading to enhanced fatty acid uptake and lipid accumulation. Interestingly, the haploinsufficiency of SIRT6 is sufficient to induce the expression of fatty acid transporters and cause lipid accumulation in murine hearts. Mechanistically, SIRT6 depletion enhances the occupancy of the transcription factor PPARgamma on the promoters of critical fatty acid transporters without modulating the acetylation of histone 3 at Lys 9 and Lys 56. Notably, the binding of SIRT6 to the DNA-binding domain of PPARgamma is critical for regulating the expression of fatty acid transporters in cardiomyocytes. Our data suggest exploiting SIRT6 as a potential therapeutic target for protecting the heart from metabolic diseases.	SIRT6 transcriptionally regulates fatty acid transport by suppressing PPARgamma.

34077723	During germinal center (GC) reactions, activated B cells undergo clonal expansion and functional maturation to produce high-affinity antibodies and differentiate into plasma and memory cells, accompanied with class-switching recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM). Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is responsible for both CSR and SHM in GC B cells. Transcriptional mechanisms underlying AID regulation and GC B cell reactions are still not well understood. Here, we show that expression of Ascl2 transcription factor is upregulated in GC B cells. Ectopic expression of Ascl2 promotes GC B cell development and enhances antibody production and affinity maturation. Conversely, deletion of Ascl2 in B cells impairs the GC response. Genome-wide analysis reveals that Ascl2 directly regulates GC B cell-related genes, including AID; ectopic expression of AID in Ascl2-deficient B cells rescues their antibody defects. Thus, Ascl2 regulates AID transcription and promotes GC B cell responses.	Transcription factor Ascl2 promotes germinal center B cell responses by directly regulating AID transcription.	Cell reports	0
34107246	The ubiquitous ribosome-associated complex (RAC) is a chaperone that spans ribosomes, making contacts near both the polypeptide exit tunnel and the decoding center, a position prime for sensing and coordinating translation and folding. Loss of RAC is known to result in growth defects and sensitization to translational and osmotic stresses. However, the physiological substrates of RAC and the mechanism(s) by which RAC is involved in responding to specific stresses in higher eukaryotes remain obscure. The data presented here uncover an essential function of mammalian RAC in the unfolded protein response (UPR). Knockdown of RAC sensitizes mammalian cells to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and selectively interferes with IRE1 branch activation. Higher-order oligomerization of the inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha (IRE1alpha) kinase/endoribonuclease depends upon RAC. These results reveal a surveillance function for RAC in the UPR, as follows: modulating IRE1alpha clustering as required for endonuclease activation and splicing of the substrate Xbp1 mRNA.

34133937	Metabolic adaptations and the signaling events that control them promote the survival of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) at the fibrotic tumor site, overcoming stresses associated with nutrient and oxygen deprivation. Recently, rewiring of NADPH production has been shown to play a key role in this process. NADPH is recycled through reduction of NADP+ by several enzymatic systems in cells. However, de novo NADP+ is synthesized only through one known enzymatic reaction, catalyzed by NAD+ kinase (NADK). In this study, we show that oncogenic KRAS promotes protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated NADK phosphorylation, leading to its hyperactivation, thus sustaining both NADP+ and NADPH levels in PDAC cells. Together, our data show that increased NADK activity is an important adaptation driven by oncogenic signaling. Our findings indicate that NADK could serve as a much-needed therapeutic target for PDAC.	NADK is activated by oncogenic signaling to sustain pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.	Cell reports	0
34133930	MYC activates different metabolic programs in a cell-type- and cell-status-dependent manner. However, the role of MYC in inflammatory macrophages has not yet been determined. Metabolic and molecular analyses reveal that MYC, but not hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1), is involved in enhancing early glycolytic flux during inflammatory macrophage polarization. Ablation of MYC decreases lactate production by regulating lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and causes increased inflammatory cytokines by regulating interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) in response to lipopolysaccharide. Moreover, myeloid-specific deletion of MYC and pharmacological inhibition of the MYC/LDH axis enhance inflammation and the bacterial clearance in vivo. These results elucidate the potential role of the MYC/LDH/IRF4 axis in inflammatory macrophages by connecting early glycolysis with inflammatory responses and suggest that modulating early glycolytic flux mediated by the MYC/LDH axis can be used to open avenues for the therapeutic modulation of macrophage polarization to fight against bacterial infection.	MYC-mediated early glycolysis negatively regulates proinflammatory responses by controlling IRF4 in inflammatory macrophages.	Cell reports	1
34133925	Loss-of-function mutations in proline-rich transmembrane protein-2 (PRRT2) cause paroxysmal disorders associated with defective Ca(2+) dependence of glutamatergic transmission. We find that either acute or constitutive PRRT2 deletion induces a significant decrease in the amplitude of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) that is insensitive to extracellular Ca(2+) and associated with a reduced contribution of P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels to the EPSC amplitude. This synaptic phenotype parallels a decrease in somatic P/Q-type Ca(2+) currents due to a decreased membrane targeting of the channel with unchanged total expression levels. Co-immunoprecipitation, pull-down assays, and proteomics reveal a specific and direct interaction of PRRT2 with P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels. At presynaptic terminals lacking PRRT2, P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels reduce their clustering at the active zone, with a corresponding decrease in the P/Q-dependent presynaptic Ca(2+) signal. The data highlight the central role of PRRT2 in ensuring the physiological Ca(2+) sensitivity of the release machinery at glutamatergic synapses.	PRRT2 modulates presynaptic Ca(2+) influx by interacting with P/Q-type channels.	Cell reports	0
34161771	The spatiotemporal coordination of multiple morphogens is essential for embryonic patterning yet poorly understood. During neural crest (NC) formation, dynamic bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and WNT signals cooperate by acting on mesoderm and ectoderm. Here, we show that Fhl3, a scaffold LIM domain protein, modulates BMP gradient interpretation during NC induction. During gastrulation, low BMP signaling neuralizes the neural border (NB) ectoderm, while Fhl3 enhances Smad1 intracellular response in underlying paraxial mesoderm, triggering the high WNT8 signals needed to pattern the NB. During neurulation, fhl3 activation in NC ectoderm promotes simultaneous high BMP and BMP-dependent WNT activity required for specification. Mechanistically, Fhl3 interacts with Smad1 and promotes Smad1 binding to wnt8 promoter in a BMP-dependent manner. Consequently, differential Fhl3 expression in adjacent cells ensures a finely tuned coordination of BMP and WNT signaling at several stages of NC development, starting by positioning the NC-inducing mesoderm center under competent NB ectoderm.	BMP signaling is enhanced intracellularly by FHL3 controlling WNT-dependent spatiotemporal emergence of the neural crest.	Cell reports	0
34161760	Developing neurons initially form excessive neurites and then remodel them based on molecular cues and neuronal activity. Developing mitral cells in the olfactory bulb initially extend multiple primary dendrites. They then stabilize single primary dendrites while eliminating others. However, the mechanisms underlying selective dendrite remodeling remain elusive. Using CRISPR-Cas9-based knockout screening combined with in utero electroporation, we identify BMPR-2 as a key regulator for selective dendrite stabilization. Bmpr2 knockout and its rescue experiments show that BMPR-2 inhibits LIMK without ligands and thereby permits dendrite destabilization. In contrast, the overexpression of antagonists and agonists indicates that ligand-bound BMPR-2 stabilizes dendrites, most likely by releasing LIMK. Using genetic and FRET imaging experiments, we demonstrate that free LIMK is activated by NMDARs via Rac1, facilitating dendrite stabilization through F-actin formation. Thus, the selective stabilization of primary dendrites is ensured by concomitant inputs of BMP ligands and neuronal activity.

34260935	The anti-tumor response of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells requires the sensing of accumulated phosphoantigens (pAgs) bound intracellularly to butyrophilin 3A1 (BTN3A1). In this study, we show that butyrophilin 2A1 (BTN2A1) is required for BTN3A-mediated Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell cytotoxicity against cancer cells, and that expression of the BTN2A1/BTN3A1 complex is sufficient to trigger Vgamma9Vdelta2 TCR activation. Also, BTN2A1 interacts with all isoforms of BTN3A (BTN3A1, BTN3A2, BTN3A3), which appears to be a rate-limiting factor to BTN2A1 export to the plasma membrane. BTN2A1/BTN3A1 interaction is enhanced by pAgs and, strikingly, B30.2 domains of both proteins are required for pAg responsiveness. BTN2A1 expression in cancer cells correlates with bisphosphonate-induced Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell cytotoxicity. Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell killing of cancer cells is modulated by anti-BTN2A1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), whose action relies on the inhibition of BTN2A1 binding to the Vgamma9Vdelta2TCR. This demonstrates the potential of BTN2A1 as a therapeutic target and adds to the emerging butyrophilin-family cooperation pathway in gammadelta T cell activation.

34260932	CINV1, converting sucrose into glucose and fructose, is a key entry of carbon into cellular metabolism, and HXK1 functions as a pivotal sensor for glucose. Exogenous sugars trigger the Arabidopsis juvenile-to-adult phase transition via a miR156A/SPL module. However, the endogenous factors that regulate this process remain unclear. In this study, we show that sucrose specifically induced the PAP1 transcription factor directly and positively controls CINV1 activity. Furthermore, we identify a glucose feed-forward loop (sucrose-CINV1-glucose-HXK1-miR156-SPL9-PAP1-CINV1-glucose) that controls CINV1 activity to convert sucrose into glucose signaling to dynamically control the juvenile-to-adult phase transition. Moreover, PAP1 directly binds to the SPL9 promoter, activating SPL9 expression and triggering the sucrose-signaling-mediated juvenile-to-adult phase transition. Therefore, a glucose-signaling feed-forward loop and a sucrose-signaling pathway synergistically regulate the Arabidopsis juvenile-to-adult phase transition. Collectively, we identify a molecular link between the major photosynthate sucrose, the entry point of carbon into cellular metabolism, and the plant juvenile-to-adult phase transition.

34260930	Axons and dendrites are long extensions of neurons that contain arrays of noncentrosomal microtubules. Calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated proteins (CAMSAPs) bind to and stabilize free microtubule minus ends and are critical for proper neuronal development and function. Previous studies have shown that the microtubule-severing ATPase katanin interacts with CAMSAPs and limits the length of CAMSAP-decorated microtubule stretches. However, how CAMSAP and microtubule minus end dynamics are regulated in neurons is poorly understood. Here, we show that the neuron-enriched protein WDR47 interacts with CAMSAPs and is critical for axon and dendrite development. We find that WDR47 accumulates at CAMSAP2-decorated microtubules, is essential for maintaining CAMSAP2 stretches, and protects minus ends from katanin-mediated severing. We propose a model where WDR47 protects CAMSAP2 at microtubule minus ends from katanin activity to ensure proper stabilization of the neuronal microtubule network.

34260925	DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired mainly by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). RIF1 negatively regulates resection through the effector Shieldin, which associates with a short 3' single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) overhang by the MRN (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1) complex, to prevent further resection and HR repair. In this study, we show that RIF1, but not Shieldin, inhibits the accumulation of CtIP at DSB sites immediately after damage, suggesting that RIF1 has another effector besides Shieldin. We find that protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a known RIF1 effector in replication, localizes at damage sites dependent on RIF1, where it suppresses downstream CtIP accumulation and limits the resection by the MRN complex. PP1 therefore acts as a RIF1 effector distinct from Shieldin. Furthermore, PP1 deficiency in the context of Shieldin depletion elevates HR immediately after irradiation. We conclude that PP1 inhibits resection before the action of Shieldin to prevent precocious HR in the early phase of the damage response.	Protein phosphatase 1 acts as a RIF1 effector to suppress DSB resection prior to Shieldin action.	Cell reports	0
34260916	Proper lung function relies on the precise balance of specialized epithelial cells that coordinate to maintain homeostasis. Herein, we describe essential roles for the transcriptional regulators YAP/TAZ in maintaining lung epithelial homeostasis, reporting that conditional deletion of Yap and Wwtr1/Taz in the lung epithelium of adult mice results in severe defects, including alveolar disorganization and the development of airway mucin hypersecretion. Through in vivo lineage tracing and in vitro molecular experiments, we reveal that reduced YAP/TAZ activity promotes intrinsic goblet transdifferentiation of secretory airway epithelial cells. Global gene expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses suggest that YAP/TAZ act cooperatively with TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factors and the NuRD complex to suppress the goblet cell fate program, directly repressing the SPDEF gene. Collectively, our study identifies YAP/TAZ as critical factors in lung epithelial homeostasis and offers molecular insight into the mechanisms promoting goblet cell differentiation, which is a hallmark of many lung diseases.

34260915	RNA-binding proteins play important roles in X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). In this study, we investigate the contribution of the XLID-associated RBMX in neuronal differentiation. We show that RBMX-depleted cells exhibit aberrant activation of the p53 pathway. Moreover, we identify that the RBMX RGG/RG motif is methylated by protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), and this regulates assembly with the SRSF1 splicing factor into higher-order complexes. Depletion of RBMX or disruption of the RBMX/SRSF1 complex in PRMT5-depleted cells reduces SRSF1 binding to the MDM4 precursor (pre-)mRNA, leading to exon 6 exclusion and lower MDM4 protein levels. Transcriptomic analysis of isogenic Shashi-XLID human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) generated using CRISPR-Cas9 reveals a dysregulation of MDM4 splicing and aberrant p53 upregulation. Shashi-XLID neural progenitor cells (NPCs) display differentiation and morphological abnormalities accompanied with excessive apoptosis. Our findings identify RBMX as a regulator of SRSF1 and the p53 pathway, suggesting that the loss of function of the RBMX RGG/RG motif is the cause of Shashi-XLID syndrome.

34260913	Mechanical stimuli including loading after birth promote bone growth. However, little is known about how mechanical force triggers biochemical signals to regulate bone growth. Here, we identified a periosteal-osteoblast-derived secretory peptide, Osteocrin (OSTN), as a mechanotransducer involved in load-induced long bone growth. OSTN produced by periosteal osteoblasts regulates growth plate growth by enhancing C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP)-dependent proliferation and maturation of chondrocytes, leading to elongation of long bones. Additionally, OSTN cooperates with CNP to regulate bone formation. CNP stimulates osteogenic differentiation of periosteal osteoprogenitors to induce bone formation. OSTN binds to natriuretic peptide receptor 3 (NPR3) in periosteal osteoprogenitors, thereby preventing NPR3-mediated clearance of CNP and consequently facilitating CNP-signal-mediated bone growth. Importantly, physiological loading induces Ostn expression in periosteal osteoblasts by suppressing Forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) transcription factor. Thus, this study reveals a crucial role of OSTN as a mechanotransducer converting mechanical loading to CNP-dependent bone formation.	Mechanical load regulates bone growth via periosteal Osteocrin.

34289359	Many neurological disorders show an increased prevalence of GluA2-lacking, Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs), which dramatically alters synaptic function. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this distinct synaptic plasticity remains enigmatic. Here, we show that nerve injury potentiates postsynaptic, but not presynaptic, CP-AMPARs in the spinal dorsal horn via alpha2delta-1. Overexpressing alpha2delta-1, previously regarded as a Ca(2+) channel subunit, augments CP-AMPAR levels at the cell surface and synapse. Mechanistically, alpha2delta-1 physically interacts with both GluA1 and GluA2 via its C terminus, inhibits the GluA1/GluA2 heteromeric assembly, and increases GluA2 retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. Consequently, alpha2delta-1 diminishes the availability and synaptic expression of GluA1/GluA2 heterotetramers in the spinal cord in neuropathic pain. Inhibiting alpha2delta-1 with gabapentin or disrupting the alpha2delta-1-AMPAR complex fully restores the intracellular assembly and synaptic dominance of heteromeric GluA1/GluA2 receptors. Thus, alpha2delta-1 is a pivotal AMPAR-interacting protein that controls the subunit composition and Ca(2+) permeability of postsynaptic AMPARs.	alpha2delta-1 switches the phenotype of synaptic AMPA receptors by physically disrupting heteromeric subunit assembly.

34289350	Cellular resources must be reorganized for long-term synaptic plasticity during brain information processing, in which coordinated gene transcription and protein turnover are required. However, the mechanism underlying this process remains elusive. Here, we report that activating N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) induce transcription-dependent autophagy for synaptic turnover and late-phase long-term synaptic depression (L-LTD), which invokes cytoplasm-to-nucleus signaling mechanisms known to be required for late-phase long-term synaptic potentiation (L-LTP). Mechanistically, LTD-inducing stimuli specifically dephosphorylate CRTC1 (CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1) at Ser-151 and are advantaged in recruiting CRTC1 from cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it competes with FXR (fed-state sensing nuclear receptor) for binding to CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) and drives autophagy gene expression. Disrupting synergistic actions of CREB and CRTC1 (two essential L-LTP transcription factors) impairs transcription-dependent autophagy induction and prevents NMDAR-dependent L-LTD, which can be rescued by constitutively inducing mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent autophagy. Together, these findings uncover mechanistic commonalities between L-LTP and L-LTD, suggesting that synaptic activity can tune excitation-transcription coupling for distinct long-lasting synaptic remodeling.	Neuronal activity recruits the CRTC1/CREB axis to drive transcription-dependent autophagy for maintaining late-phase LTD.	Cell reports	0
34289349	Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are essential for male fertility. Here, we report that mouse SSC generation is driven by a transcription factor (TF) cascade controlled by the homeobox protein, RHOX10, which acts by driving the differentiation of SSC precursors called pro-spermatogonia (ProSG). We identify genes regulated by RHOX10 in ProSG in vivo and define direct RHOX10-target genes using several approaches, including a rapid temporal induction assay: iSLAMseq. Together, these approaches identify temporal waves of RHOX10 direct targets, as well as RHOX10 secondary-target genes. Many of the RHOX10-regulated genes encode proteins with known roles in SSCs. Using an in vitro ProSG differentiation assay, we find that RHOX10 promotes mouse ProSG differentiation through a conserved transcriptional cascade involving the key germ-cell TFs DMRT1 and ZBTB16. Our study gives important insights into germ cell development and provides a blueprint for how to define TF cascades.

34320363	Metastasis is a complex and poorly understood process. In pancreatic cancer, loss of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta/BMP effector SMAD4 is correlated with changes in altered histopathological transitions, metastatic disease, and poor prognosis. In this study, we use isogenic cancer cell lines to identify SMAD4 regulated genes that contribute to the development of metastatic colonization. We perform an in vivo screen identifying FOSL1 as both a SMAD4 target and sufficient to drive colonization to the lung. The targeting of these genes early in treatment may provide a therapeutic benefit.	SMAD4 represses FOSL1 expression and pancreatic cancer metastatic colonization.	Cell reports	1
34320350	In glioblastoma (GBM), the most frequent and lethal brain tumor, therapies suppressing recurrently altered signaling pathways failed to extend survival. However, in patient subsets, specific genetic lesions can confer sensitivity to targeted agents. By exploiting an integrated model based on patient-derived stem-like cells, faithfully recapitulating the original GBMs in vitro and in vivo, here, we identify a human GBM subset ( approximately 9% of all GBMs) characterized by ERBB3 overexpression and nuclear accumulation. ERBB3 overexpression is driven by inheritable promoter methylation or post-transcriptional silencing of the oncosuppressor miR-205 and sustains the malignant phenotype. Overexpressed ERBB3 behaves as a specific signaling platform for fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), driving PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway hyperactivation, and overall metabolic upregulation. As a result, ERBB3 inhibition by specific antibodies is lethal for GBM stem-like cells and xenotransplants. These findings highlight a subset of patients eligible for ERBB3-targeted therapy.

34320348	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide, in which adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutations are frequently and uniquely observed. Here we find that cis-HOX (circular RNA stabilizing HOXC10) is robustly expressed in colorectal tumor-initiating cells (TICs). cis-HOX knockout decreases colorectal TIC numbers and impairs the self-renewal, tumorigenesis, and metastatic capacities of TICs, whereas cis-HOX overexpression drives colorectal TIC self-renewal and metastasis. Mechanistically, cis-HOX binds to HOXC10 mRNA to attenuate its decay through blocking the K-homology splicing regulatory protein (KSRP)-binding sequence of HOXC10 3' UTR. HOXC10 is highly expressed in colorectal tumors and TICs and triggers Wnt/beta-catenin activation by activating FZD3 expression. HOXC10 inhibitor salinomycin exerts efficient therapeutic effects in APC-wild-type colorectal tumors, but not in tumors with APC nonsense mutations. Therefore, the cis-HOX-HOXC10 pathway drives colorectal tumorigenesis, stemness, and metastasis and serves as a potential therapeutic target for APC-wild-type colorectal tumors.

34320341	Lipid droplets (LDs) are dynamic organelles that undergo dynamic changes in response to changing cellular conditions. During nutrient depletion, LD numbers increase to protect cells against toxic fatty acids generated through autophagy and provide fuel for beta-oxidation. However, the precise mechanisms through which these changes are regulated have remained unclear. Here, we show that the small GTPase RalA acts downstream of autophagy to directly facilitate LD growth during nutrient depletion. Mechanistically, RalA performs this function through phospholipase D1 (PLD1), an enzyme that converts phosphatidylcholine (PC) to phosphatidic acid (PA) and that is recruited to lysosomes during nutrient stress in a RalA-dependent fashion. RalA inhibition prevents recruitment of the LD-associated protein perilipin 3, which is required for LD growth. Our data support a model in which RalA recruits PLD1 to lysosomes during nutrient deprivation to promote the localized production of PA and the recruitment of perilipin 3 to expanding LDs.	RalA and PLD1 promote lipid droplet growth in response to nutrient withdrawal.	Cell reports	0
34320339	Transcription factors harbor defined regulatory intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which raises the question of how they mediate binding to structured co-regulators and modulate their activity. Here, we present a detailed molecular regulatory mechanism of Forkhead box O4 (FOXO4) by the structured transcriptional co-regulator beta-catenin. We find that the disordered FOXO4 C-terminal region, which contains its transactivation domain, binds beta-catenin through two defined interaction sites, and this is regulated by combined PKB/AKT- and CK1-mediated phosphorylation. Binding of beta-catenin competes with the autoinhibitory interaction of the FOXO4 disordered region with its DNA-binding Forkhead domain, and thereby enhances FOXO4 transcriptional activity. Furthermore, we show that binding of the beta-catenin inhibitor protein ICAT is compatible with FOXO4 binding to beta-catenin, suggesting that ICAT acts as a molecular switch between anti-proliferative FOXO and pro-proliferative Wnt/TCF/LEF signaling. These data illustrate how the interplay of IDRs, post-translational modifications, and co-factor binding contribute to transcription factor function.

34320338	During microbial infection, bystander CD8(+) T cells that are not specific to infecting pathogens can be activated by interleukin (IL)-15. However, the tissue-homing properties of bystander-activated CD8(+) T cells have not been elucidated. Here, we examine the effects of IL-15 on the expression of chemokine receptors on CD8(+) T cells and their migration. IL-15 upregulates CCR5 in memory CD8(+) T cells in the absence of T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and enhances CCR5-dependent migration. IL-15-induced CCR5 upregulation is abrogated by TCR stimulation, indicating that CCR5 is upregulated in bystander-activated CD8(+) T cells. Moreover, CCR5 signals increase proliferation and cytotoxic protein expression in IL-15-treated memory CD8(+) T cells, although the increase has a small extent. CCR5 upregulation in bystander-activated CD8(+) T cells is associated with severe liver injury in patients with acute hepatitis A. Altogether, the results indicate that CCR5 upregulation by IL-15 mediates the migration of bystander-activated CD8(+) T cells.	IL-15 enhances CCR5-mediated migration of memory CD8(+) T cells by upregulating CCR5 expression in the absence of TCR stimulation.	Cell reports	1
34348164	The evolutionarily conserved Nrf2-Keap1 pathway is a key antioxidant response pathway that protects cells/organisms against detrimental effects of oxidative stress. Impaired Nrf2 function is associated with cancer and neurodegenerative diseases in humans. However, the function of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway in the developing nervous systems has not been established. Here we demonstrate a cell-autonomous role of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway, composed of CncC/Nrf2, Keap1, and MafS, in governing neuronal remodeling during Drosophila metamorphosis. Nrf2-Keap1 signaling is activated downstream of the steroid hormone ecdysone. Mechanistically, the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway is activated via cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of CncC in an importin- and ecdysone-signaling-dependent manner. Moreover, Nrf2-Keap1 signaling regulates dendrite pruning independent of its canonical antioxidant response pathway, acting instead through proteasomal degradation. This study reveals an epistatic link between the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway and steroid hormone signaling and demonstrates an antioxidant-independent but proteasome-dependent role of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway in neuronal remodeling.	The Nrf2-Keap1 pathway is activated by steroid hormone signaling to govern neuronal remodeling.	Cell reports	1
34348161	Reversible monoubiquitination of small subunit ribosomal proteins RPS2/uS5 and RPS3/uS3 has been noted to occur on ribosomes involved in ZNF598-dependent mRNA surveillance. Subsequent deubiquitination of RPS2 and RPS3 by USP10 is critical for recycling of stalled ribosomes in a process known as ribosome-associated quality control. Here, we identify and characterize the RPS2- and RPS3-specific E3 ligase Really Interesting New Gene (RING) finger protein 10 (RNF10) and its role in translation. Overexpression of RNF10 increases 40S ribosomal subunit degradation similarly to the knockout of USP10. Although a substantial fraction of RNF10-mediated RPS2 and RPS3 monoubiquitination results from ZNF598-dependent sensing of collided ribosomes, ZNF598-independent impairment of translation initiation and elongation also contributes to RPS2 and RPS3 monoubiquitination. RNF10 photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) identifies crosslinked mRNAs, tRNAs, and 18S rRNAs, indicating recruitment of RNF10 to ribosomes stalled in translation. These impeded ribosomes are tagged by ubiquitin at their 40S subunit for subsequent programmed degradation unless rescued by USP10.	The E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF10 modifies 40S ribosomal subunits of ribosomes compromised in translation.	Cell reports	0
34380042	Humoral immunity relies on the efficient differentiation of memory B cells (MBCs) into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). T helper (Th) signals upregulate B cell receptor (BCR) signaling by potentiating Src family kinases through increasing CD45 phosphatase activity (CD45 PA). In this study, we show that high CD45 PA in MBCs enhances BCR signaling and is essential for their effective ASC differentiation. Mechanistically, Th signals upregulate CD45 PA through intensifying the surface binding of a CD45 ligand, Galectin-1. CD45 PA works as a sensor of T cell help and defines high-affinity germinal center (GC) plasma cell (PC) precursors characterized by IRF4 expression in vivo. Increasing T cell help in vitro results in an incremental CD45 PA increase and enhances ASC differentiation by facilitating effective induction of the transcription factors IRF4 and BLIMP1. This study connects Th signals with BCR signaling through Galectin-1-dependent regulation of CD45 PA and provides a mechanism for efficient ASC differentiation of MBCs.	Integration of T helper and BCR signals governs enhanced plasma cell differentiation of memory B cells by regulation of CD45 phosphatase activity.	Cell reports	1
34380030	HIV-1-negative factor (Nef) protein antagonizes serine incorporator 5 (SERINC5) by redirecting this potent restriction factor to the endosomes and lysosomes for degradation. However, the precise mechanism remains unclear. Using affinity purification/mass spectrometry, we identify cyclin K (CycK) and cyclin-dependent kinase 13 (CDK13) as a Nef-associated kinase complex. CycK/CDK13 phosphorylates the serine at position 360 (S360) in SERINC5, which is required for Nef downregulation of SERINC5 from the cell surface and its counteractivity of the SERINC5 antiviral activity. To understand the role of S360 phosphorylation, we generate chimeric proteins between CD8 and SERINC5 to study their response to Nef. Nef not only downregulates but, importantly, also binds to this chimera in an S360-dependent manner. Thus, S360 phosphorylation increases interactions between Nef and SERINC5 and initiates the destruction of SERINC5 by the endocytic machinery.	HIV-1 Nef interacts with the cyclin K/CDK13 complex to antagonize SERINC5 for optimal viral infectivity.	Cell reports	0
32441762	Approximately one third of cancer patients die due to complexities related to cachexia. However, the mechanisms of cachexia and the potential therapeutic interventions remain poorly studied. We observed a significant positive correlation between SIRT1 expression and muscle fiber cross-sectional area in pancreatic cancer patients. Rescuing Sirt1 expression by exogenous expression or pharmacological agents reverted cancer cell-induced myotube wasting in culture conditions and mouse models. RNA-seq and follow-up analyses showed cancer cell-mediated SIRT1 loss induced NF-kappaB signaling in cachectic muscles that enhanced the expression of FOXO transcription factors and NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), a key regulator of reactive oxygen species production. Additionally, we observed a negative correlation between NOX4 expression and skeletal muscle fiber cross-sectional area in pancreatic cancer patients. Knocking out Nox4 in skeletal muscles or pharmacological blockade of Nox4 activity abrogated tumor-induced cachexia in mice. Thus, we conclude that targeting the Sirt1-Nox4 axis in muscles is an effective therapeutic intervention for mitigating pancreatic cancer-induced cachexia.	SIRT1-NOX4 signaling axis regulates cancer cachexia.	The Journal of experimental medicine	1
32609329	The establishment of protective humoral immunity is dependent on the ability of mature B cells to undergo antibody gene diversification while adjusting to the physiological stressors induced by activation with the antigen. Mature B cells diversify their antibody genes by class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM), which are both dependent on efficient induction of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). Here, we identified PDGFA-associated protein 1 (Pdap1) as an essential regulator of cellular homeostasis in mature B cells. Pdap1 deficiency leads to sustained expression of the integrated stress response (ISR) effector activating transcription factor 4 (Atf4) and induction of the ISR transcriptional program, increased cell death, and defective AID expression. As a consequence, loss of Pdap1 reduces germinal center B cell formation and impairs CSR and SHM. Thus, Pdap1 protects mature B cells against chronic ISR activation and ensures efficient antibody diversification by promoting their survival and optimal function.	PDGFA-associated protein 1 protects mature B lymphocytes from stress-induced cell death and promotes antibody gene diversification.	The Journal of experimental medicine	1
32865561	The autosomal recessive immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, and facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. Despite the identification of the underlying gene defects, it is unclear how mutations in any of the four known ICF genes cause a primary immunodeficiency. Here we demonstrate that loss of ZBTB24 in B cells from mice and ICF2 patients affects nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) during immunoglobulin class-switch recombination and consequently impairs immunoglobulin production and isotype balance. Mechanistically, we found that ZBTB24 associates with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and stimulates its auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. The zinc-finger in ZBTB24 binds PARP1-associated poly(ADP-ribose) chains and mediates the PARP1-dependent recruitment of ZBTB24 to DNA breaks. Moreover, through its association with poly(ADP-ribose) chains, ZBTB24 protects them from degradation by poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG). This facilitates the poly(ADP-ribose)-dependent assembly of the LIG4/XRCC4 complex at DNA breaks, thereby promoting error-free NHEJ. Thus, we uncover ZBTB24 as a regulator of PARP1-dependent NHEJ and class-switch recombination, providing a molecular basis for the immunodeficiency in ICF2 syndrome.	Loss of ZBTB24 impairs nonhomologous end-joining and class-switch recombination in patients with ICF syndrome.	The Journal of experimental medicine	0
32725126	Pathogenic COPA variants cause a Mendelian syndrome of immune dysregulation with elevated type I interferon signaling. COPA is a subunit of coat protein complex I (COPI) that mediates Golgi to ER transport. Missense mutations of the COPA WD40 domain impair binding and sorting of proteins targeted for ER retrieval, but how this causes disease remains unknown. Given the importance of COPA in Golgi-ER transport, we speculated that type I interferon signaling in COPA syndrome involves missorting of STING. We show that a defect in COPI transport causes ligand-independent activation of STING. Furthermore, SURF4 is an adapter molecule that facilitates COPA-mediated retrieval of STING at the Golgi. Activated STING stimulates type I interferon-driven inflammation in CopaE241K/+ mice that is rescued in STING-deficient animals. Our results demonstrate that COPA maintains immune homeostasis by regulating STING transport at the Golgi. In addition, activated STING contributes to immune dysregulation in COPA syndrome and may be a new molecular target in treating the disease.	A defect in COPI-mediated transport of STING causes immune dysregulation in COPA syndrome.	The Journal of experimental medicine	0
32970800	Endothelial cell calcium flux is critical for leukocyte transendothelial migration (TEM), which in turn is essential for the inflammatory response. Intravital microscopy of endothelial cell calcium dynamics reveals that calcium increases locally and transiently around the transmigration pore during TEM. Endothelial calmodulin (CaM), a key calcium signaling protein, interacts with the IQ domain of IQGAP1, which is localized to endothelial junctions and is required for TEM. In the presence of calcium, CaM binds endothelial calcium/calmodulin kinase IIdelta (CaMKIIdelta). Disrupting the function of CaM or CaMKII with small-molecule inhibitors, expression of a CaMKII inhibitory peptide, or expression of dominant negative CaMKIIdelta significantly reduces TEM by interfering with the delivery of the lateral border recycling compartment (LBRC) to the site of TEM. Endothelial CaMKII is also required for TEM in vivo as shown in two independent mouse models. These findings highlight novel roles for endothelial CaM and CaMKIIdelta in transducing the spatiotemporally restricted calcium signaling required for TEM.	Spatiotemporal restriction of endothelial cell calcium signaling is required during leukocyte transmigration.	The Journal of experimental medicine	0
33104171	ILC2s are present in adipose tissue and play a critical role in regulating adipose thermogenesis. However, the mechanisms underlying the activation of adipose-resident ILC2s remain poorly defined. Here, we show that IL-33, a potent ILC2 activator, stimulates phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172 via TAK1 in primary ILC2s, which provides a feedback mechanism to inhibit IL-33-induced NF-kappaB activation and IL-13 production. Treating ILC2s with adiponectin or an adiponectin receptor agonist (AdipoRon) activated AMPK and decreased IL-33-NF-kappaB signaling. AdipoRon also suppressed cold-induced thermogenic gene expression and energy expenditure in vivo. In contrast, adiponectin deficiency increased the ILC2 fraction and activation, leading to up-regulated thermogenic gene expression in adipose tissue of cold-exposed mice. ILC2 deficiency or blocking ILC2 function by neutralization of the IL-33 receptor with anti-ST2 diminished the suppressive effect of adiponectin on cold-induced adipose thermogenesis and energy expenditure. Taken together, our study reveals that adiponectin is a negative regulator of ILC2 function in adipose tissue via AMPK-mediated negative regulation of IL-33 signaling.	Adiponectin restrains ILC2 activation by AMPK-mediated feedback inhibition of IL-33 signaling.	The Journal of experimental medicine	0
33306108	Cell migration relies on coordinated activity of chemotactic and guidance receptors. Here, we report a specific role for the RNA-binding protein ZFP36L1 in limiting the abundance of molecules involved in the homing of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) to the bone marrow (BM). In the absence of ZFP36L1, ASCs build up in the spleen and the liver and show diminished accumulation in the BM. ZFP36L1 facilitates migration by directly regulating G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) and the integrin chains alpha4 and beta1 in splenic ASCs. Expression of CXCR4 and of the integrins alpha4 and beta1 is differentially regulated on ASCs produced at the early and late stages of the immune response. Consequently, deletion of the Zfp36l1 gene has a stronger effect on BM accumulation of high-affinity ASCs formed late in the response. Thus, ZFP36L1 is an integral part of the regulatory network controlling gene expression during ASC homing.	Efficient homing of antibody-secreting cells to the bone marrow requires RNA-binding protein ZFP36L1.	The Journal of experimental medicine	0
33755722	The oncogene DEK is found fused with the NUP214 gene creating oncoprotein DEK-NUP214 that induces acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients, and secreted DEK protein functions as a hematopoietic cytokine to regulate hematopoiesis; however, the intrinsic role of nuclear DEK in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remains largely unknown. Here, we show that HSCs lacking DEK display defects in long-term self-renew capacity, eventually resulting in impaired hematopoiesis. DEK deficiency reduces quiescence and accelerates mitochondrial metabolism in HSCs, in part, dependent upon activating mTOR signaling. At the molecular level, DEK recruits the corepressor NCoR1 to repress acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac) and restricts the chromatin accessibility of HSCs, governing the expression of quiescence-associated genes (e.g., Akt1/2, Ccnb2, and p21). Inhibition of mTOR activity largely restores the maintenance and potential of Dek-cKO HSCs. These findings highlight the crucial role of nuclear DEK in preserving HSC potential, uncovering a new link between chromatin remodelers and HSC homeostasis, and have clinical implications.	Nuclear DEK preserves hematopoietic stem cells potential via NCoR1/HDAC3-Akt1/2-mTOR axis.	The Journal of experimental medicine	1
33688918	Aging is a strong risk factor and an independent prognostic factor for progressive human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Aged mice develop nonresolving pulmonary fibrosis following lung injury. In this study, we found that mouse double minute 4 homolog (MDM4) is highly expressed in the fibrotic lesions of human IPF and experimental pulmonary fibrosis in aged mice. We identified MDM4 as a matrix stiffness-regulated endogenous inhibitor of p53. Reducing matrix stiffness down-regulates MDM4 expression, resulting in p53 activation in primary lung myofibroblasts isolated from IPF patients. Gain of p53 function activates a gene program that sensitizes lung myofibroblasts to apoptosis and promotes the clearance of apoptotic myofibroblasts by macrophages. Destiffening of the fibrotic lung matrix by targeting nonenzymatic cross-linking or genetic ablation of Mdm4 in lung (myo)fibroblasts activates the Mdm4-p53 pathway and promotes lung fibrosis resolution in aged mice. These findings suggest that mechanosensitive MDM4 is a molecular target with promising therapeutic potential against persistent lung fibrosis associated with aging.

33970189	Because of their common signaling molecules, the main T cell receptor (TCR) signaling cascades in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are considered qualitatively identical. Herein, we show that TCR signaling in CD8+ T cells is qualitatively different from that in CD4+ T cells, since CD8alpha ignites another cardinal signaling cascade involving phospholipase C beta4 (PLCbeta4). TCR-mediated responses were severely impaired in PLCbeta4-deficient CD8+ T cells, whereas those in CD4+ T cells were intact. PLCbeta4-deficient CD8+ T cells showed perturbed activation of peripheral TCR signaling pathways downstream of IP3 generation. Binding of PLCbeta4 to the cytoplasmic tail of CD8alpha was important for CD8+ T cell activation. Furthermore, GNAQ interacted with PLCbeta4, mediated double phosphorylation on threonine 886 and serine 890 positions of PLCbeta4, and activated CD8+ T cells in a PLCbeta4-dependent fashion. PLCbeta4-deficient mice exhibited defective antiparasitic host defense and antitumor immune responses. Altogether, PLCbeta4 differentiates TCR signaling in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and selectively promotes CD8+ T cell-dependent adaptive immunity.

34160549	N 6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent posttranscriptional modification on RNA. NK cells are the predominant innate lymphoid cells that mediate antiviral and antitumor immunity. However, whether and how m6A modifications affect NK cell immunity remain unknown. Here, we discover that YTHDF2, a well-known m6A reader, is upregulated in NK cells upon activation by cytokines, tumors, and cytomegalovirus infection. Ythdf2 deficiency in NK cells impairs NK cell antitumor and antiviral activity in vivo. YTHDF2 maintains NK cell homeostasis and terminal maturation, correlating with modulating NK cell trafficking and regulating Eomes, respectively. YTHDF2 promotes NK cell effector function and is required for IL-15-mediated NK cell survival and proliferation by forming a STAT5-YTHDF2 positive feedback loop. Transcriptome-wide screening identifies Tardbp to be involved in cell proliferation or survival as a YTHDF2-binding target in NK cells. Collectively, we elucidate the biological roles of m6A modifications in NK cells and highlight a new direction to harness NK cell antitumor immunity.

34156424	Biochemical, pathogenic, and human genetic data confirm that GSAP (gamma-secretase activating protein), a selective gamma-secretase modulatory protein, plays important roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down's syndrome. However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying GSAP-dependent pathogenesis remains largely elusive. Here, through unbiased proteomics and single-nuclei RNAseq, we identified that GSAP regulates multiple biological pathways, including protein phosphorylation, trafficking, lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial function. We demonstrated that GSAP physically interacts with the Fe65-APP complex to regulate APP trafficking/partitioning. GSAP is enriched in the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) and regulates lipid homeostasis through the amyloidogenic processing of APP. GSAP deletion generates a lipid environment unfavorable for AD pathogenesis, leading to improved mitochondrial function and the rescue of cognitive deficits in an AD mouse model. Finally, we identified a novel GSAP single-nucleotide polymorphism that regulates its brain transcript level and is associated with an increased AD risk. Together, our findings indicate that GSAP impairs mitochondrial function through its MAM localization and that lowering GSAP expression reduces pathological effects associated with AD.	GSAP regulates lipid homeostasis and mitochondrial function associated with Alzheimer's disease.	The Journal of experimental medicine	0
32520957	In the tumor microenvironment, local immune dysregulation is driven in part by macrophages and dendritic cells that are polarized to a mixed proinflammatory/immune-suppressive phenotype. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is emerging as the possible origin of these events. Here we report that the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1alpha) branch of the UPR is directly involved in the polarization of macrophages in vitro and in vivo, including the up-regulation of interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-23, Arginase1, as well as surface expression of CD86 and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Macrophages in which the IRE1alpha/X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1) axis is blocked pharmacologically or deleted genetically have significantly reduced polarization and CD86 and PD-L1 expression, which was induced independent of IFNgamma signaling, suggesting a novel mechanism in PD-L1 regulation in macrophages. Mice with IRE1alpha- but not Xbp1-deficient macrophages showed greater survival than controls when implanted with B16.F10 melanoma cells. Remarkably, we found a significant association between the IRE1alpha gene signature and CD274 gene expression in tumor-infiltrating macrophages in humans. RNA sequencing (RNASeq) analysis showed that bone marrow-derived macrophages with IRE1alpha deletion lose the integrity of the gene connectivity characteristic of regulated IRE1alpha-dependent decay (RIDD) and the ability to activate CD274 gene expression. Thus, the IRE1alpha/Xbp1 axis drives the polarization of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment initiating a complex immune dysregulation leading to failure of local immune surveillance.	IRE1alpha regulates macrophage polarization, PD-L1 expression, and tumor survival.	PLoS biology	1
32516310	Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1)-autophagy-related 13 (ATG13) is the most upstream autophagy initiation complex that is phosphorylated by mammalian target-of-rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to induce autophagy in asynchronous conditions. However, their phospho-regulation and functions in mitosis and cell cycle remain unknown. Here we show that ULK1-ATG13 complex is differentially regulated throughout the cell cycle, especially in mitosis, in which both ULK1 and ATG13 are highly phosphorylated by the key cell cycle machinery cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)/cyclin B. Combining mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis, we found that CDK1-induced ULK1-ATG13 phosphorylation promotes mitotic autophagy and cell cycle progression. Moreover, double knockout (DKO) of ULK1 and ATG13 could block cell cycle progression and significantly decrease cancer cell proliferation in cell line and mouse models. Our results not only bridge the mutual regulation between the core machinery of autophagy and mitosis but also illustrate the positive function of ULK1-ATG13 and their phosphorylation by CDK1 in mitotic autophagy regulation.

32502201	Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are vascular lesions predominantly developing in the central nervous system (CNS), with no effective treatments other than surgery. Loss-of-function mutation in CCM1/krev interaction trapped 1 (KRIT1), CCM2, or CCM3/programmed cell death 10 (PDCD10) causes lesions that are characterized by abnormal vascular integrity. Vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), a major regulator of endothelial cell (EC) junctional integrity is strongly disorganized in ECs lining the CCM lesions. We report here that microRNA-27a (miR-27a), a negative regulator of VE-cadherin, is elevated in ECs isolated from mouse brains developing early CCM lesions and in cultured ECs with CCM1 or CCM2 depletion. Furthermore, we show miR-27a acts downstream of kruppel-like factor (KLF)2 and KLF4, two known key transcription factors involved in CCM lesion development. Using CD5-2 (a target site blocker [TSB]) to prevent the miR-27a/VE-cadherin mRNA interaction, we present a potential therapy to increase VE-cadherin expression and thus rescue the abnormal vascular integrity. In CCM1- or CCM2-depleted ECs, CD5-2 reduces monolayer permeability, and in Ccm1 heterozygous mice, it restores dermal vessel barrier function. In a neonatal mouse model of CCM disease, CD5-2 normalizes vasculature and reduces vascular leakage in the lesions, inhibits the development of large lesions, and significantly reduces the size of established lesions in the hindbrain. Furthermore, CD5-2 limits the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the lesion area. Our work has established that VE-cadherin is a potential therapeutic target for normalization of the vasculature and highlights that targeting miR-27a/VE-cadherin interaction by CD5-2 is a potential novel therapy for the devastating disease, CCM.

33186350	Metabolic reprogramming to fulfill the biosynthetic and bioenergetic demands of cancer cells has aroused great interest in recent years. However, metabolic reprogramming for cancer metastasis has not been well elucidated. Here, we screened a subpopulation of breast cancer cells with highly metastatic capacity to the lung in mice and investigated the metabolic alternations by analyzing the metabolome and the transcriptome, which were confirmed in breast cancer cells, mouse models, and patients' tissues. The effects and the mechanisms of nucleotide de novo synthesis in cancer metastasis were further evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In our study, we report an increased nucleotide de novo synthesis as a key metabolic hallmark in metastatic breast cancer cells and revealed that enforced nucleotide de novo synthesis was enough to drive the metastasis of breast cancer cells. An increased key metabolite of de novo synthesis, guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP), is able to generate more cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) to activate cGMP-dependent protein kinases PKG and downstream MAPK pathway, resulting in the increased tumor cell stemness and metastasis. Blocking de novo synthesis by silencing phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase 2 (PRPS2) can effectively decrease the stemness of breast cancer cells and reduce the lung metastasis. More interestingly, in breast cancer patients, the level of plasma uric acid (UA), a downstream metabolite of purine, is tightly correlated with patient's survival. Our study uncovered that increased de novo synthesis is a metabolic hallmark of metastatic breast cancer cells and its metabolites can regulate the signaling pathway to promote the stemness and metastasis of breast cancer.

33137110	The steroid hormone progesterone (P4) mediates many physiological processes through either nuclear receptors that modulate gene expression or membrane P4 receptors (mPRs) that mediate nongenomic signaling. mPR signaling remains poorly understood. Here we show that the topology of mPRbeta is similar to adiponectin receptors and opposite to that of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Using Xenopus oocyte meiosis as a well-established physiological readout of nongenomic P4 signaling, we demonstrate that mPRbeta signaling requires the adaptor protein APPL1 and the kinase Akt2. We further show that P4 induces clathrin-dependent endocytosis of mPRbeta into signaling endosome, where mPR interacts transiently with APPL1 and Akt2 to induce meiosis. Our findings outline the early steps involved in mPR signaling and expand the spectrum of mPR signaling through the multitude of pathways involving APPL1.

33370260	"Cilia play critical roles during embryonic development and adult homeostasis. Dysfunction of cilia leads to various human genetic diseases, including many caused by defects in transition zones (TZs), the ""gates"" of cilia. The evolutionarily conserved TZ component centrosomal protein 290 (CEP290) is the most frequently mutated human ciliopathy gene, but its roles in ciliogenesis are not completely understood. Here, we report that CEP290 plays an essential role in the initiation of TZ assembly in Drosophila. Mechanistically, the N-terminus of CEP290 directly recruits DAZ interacting zinc finger protein 1 (DZIP1), which then recruits Chibby (CBY) and Rab8 to promote early ciliary membrane formation. Complete deletion of CEP290 blocks ciliogenesis at the initiation stage of TZ assembly, which can be mimicked by DZIP1 deletion mutants. Remarkably, expression of the N-terminus of CEP290 alone restores the TZ localization of DZIP1 and subsequently ameliorates the defects in TZ assembly initiation in cep290 mutants. Our results link CEP290 to DZIP1-CBY/Rab8 module and uncover a previously uncharacterized important function of CEP290 in the coordination of early ciliary membrane formation and TZ assembly."

33275593	Loss of hepatic fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase B (Aldob) leads to a paradoxical up-regulation of glucose metabolism to favor hepatocellular carcinogenesis (HCC), but the upstream signaling events remain poorly defined. Akt is highly activated in HCC, and targeting Akt is being explored as a potential therapy for HCC. Herein, we demonstrate that Aldob suppresses Akt activity and tumor growth through a protein complex containing Aldob, Akt, and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), leading to inhibition of cell viability, cell cycle progression, glucose uptake, and metabolism. Interestingly, Aldob directly interacts with phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) and promotes the recruitment of PP2A to dephosphorylate p-Akt, and this scaffolding effect of Aldob is independent of its enzymatic activity. Loss of Aldob or disruption of Aldob/Akt interaction in Aldob R304A mutant restores Akt activity and tumor-promoting effects. Consistently, Aldob and p-Akt expression are inversely correlated in human HCC tissues, and Aldob down-regulation coupled with p-Akt up-regulation predicts a poor prognosis for HCC. We have further discovered that Akt inhibition or a specific small-molecule activator of PP2A (SMAP) efficiently attenuates HCC tumorigenesis in xenograft mouse models. Our work reveals a novel nonenzymatic role of Aldob in negative regulation of Akt activation, suggesting that directly inhibiting Akt activity or through reactivating PP2A may be a potential therapeutic approach for HCC treatment.

33264286	Adverse cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI) causes structural and functional changes in the heart leading to heart failure. The initial post-MI pro-inflammatory response followed by reparative or anti-inflammatory response is essential for minimizing the myocardial damage, healing, and scar formation. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) are recruited to the injured myocardium and are essential for cardiac repair as they can adopt both pro-inflammatory or reparative phenotypes to modulate inflammatory and reparative responses, respectively. Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are the key mediators of the Hippo signaling pathway and are essential for cardiac regeneration and repair. However, their functions in macrophage polarization and post-MI inflammation, remodeling, and healing are not well established. Here, we demonstrate that expression of YAP and TAZ is increased in macrophages undergoing pro-inflammatory or reparative phenotype changes. Genetic deletion of YAP/TAZ leads to impaired pro-inflammatory and enhanced reparative response. Consistently, YAP activation enhanced pro-inflammatory and impaired reparative response. We show that YAP/TAZ promote pro-inflammatory response by increasing interleukin 6 (IL6) expression and impede reparative response by decreasing Arginase-I (Arg1) expression through interaction with the histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)-nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1) repressor complex. These changes in macrophages polarization due to YAP/TAZ deletion results in reduced fibrosis, hypertrophy, and increased angiogenesis, leading to improved cardiac function after MI. Also, YAP activation augmented MI-induced cardiac fibrosis and remodeling. In summary, we identify YAP/TAZ as important regulators of macrophage-mediated pro-inflammatory or reparative responses post-MI.	YAP/TAZ deficiency reprograms macrophage phenotype and improves infarct healing and cardiac function after myocardial infarction.	PLoS biology	0
33886552	The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is essential for organ development, homeostasis, and regeneration. Dysfunction of this cascade drives several cancers. To control expression of pathway target genes, the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Smoothened (SMO) activates glioma-associated (GLI) transcription factors via an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that, rather than conforming to traditional GPCR signaling paradigms, SMO activates GLI by binding and sequestering protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunits at the membrane. This sequestration, triggered by GPCR kinase (GRK)-mediated phosphorylation of SMO intracellular domains, prevents PKA from phosphorylating soluble substrates, releasing GLI from PKA-mediated inhibition. Our work provides a mechanism directly linking Hh signal transduction at the membrane to GLI transcription in the nucleus. This process is more fundamentally similar between species than prevailing hypotheses suggest.

32338744	RNA binding proteins (RBPs) frequently regulate the expression of other RBPs in mammalian cells. Such cross-regulation has been proposed to be important to control networks of coordinated gene expression; however, much remains to be understood about how such networks of cross-regulation are established and what the functional consequence is of coordinated or reciprocal expression of RBPs. Here we demonstrate that the RBPs CELF2 and hnRNP C regulate the expression of each other, such that depletion of one results in reduced expression of the other. Specifically, we show that loss of hnRNP C reduces the transcription of CELF2 mRNA, while loss of CELF2 results in decreased efficiency of hnRNP C translation. We further demonstrate that this reciprocal regulation serves to fine tune the splicing patterns of many downstream target genes. Together, this work reveals new activities of hnRNP C and CELF2, provides insight into a previously unrecognized gene regulatory network, and demonstrates how cross-regulation of RBPs functions to shape the cellular transcriptome.

32324216	Resistance to androgen receptor (AR) targeting therapeutics in prostate cancer (PC) is a significant clinical problem. Mechanisms by which this is accomplished include AR amplification and expression of AR splice variants, demonstrating that AR remains a key therapeutic target in advanced disease. For the first time we show that IKBKE drives AR signalling in advanced PC. Significant inhibition of AR regulated gene expression was observed upon siRNA-mediated IKBKE depletion or pharmacological inhibition due to inhibited AR gene expression in multiple cell line models including a LNCaP derivative cell line resistant to the anti-androgen, enzalutamide (LNCaP-EnzR). Phenotypically, this resulted in significant inhibition of proliferation, migration and colony forming ability suggesting that targeting IKBKE could circumvent resistance to AR targeting therapies. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition in the CWR22Rv1 xenograft mouse model reduced tumour size and enhanced survival. Critically, this was validated in patient-derived explants where enzymatic inactivation of IKBKE reduced cell proliferation and AR expression. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that IKBKE regulates AR levels via Hippo pathway inhibition to reduce c-MYC levels at cis-regulatory elements within the AR gene. Thus, IKBKE is a therapeutic target in advanced PC suggesting repurposing of clinically tested IKBKE inhibitors could be beneficial to castrate resistant PC patients.	IKBKE activity enhances AR levels in advanced prostate cancer via modulation of the Hippo pathway.	Nucleic acids research	1
32399566	Transcription and pre-mRNA splicing are coupled to promote gene expression and regulation. However, mechanisms by which transcription and splicing influence each other are still under investigation. The ATPase Prp5p is required for pre-spliceosome assembly and splicing proofreading at the branch-point region. From an open UV mutagenesis screen for genetic suppressors of prp5 defects and subsequent targeted testing, we identify components of the TBP-binding module of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 Acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex, Spt8p and Spt3p. Spt8Delta and spt3Delta rescue the cold-sensitivity of prp5-GAR allele, and prp5 mutants restore growth of spt8Delta and spt3Delta strains on 6-azauracil. By chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we find that prp5 alleles decrease recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to an intron-containing gene, which is rescued by spt8Delta. Further ChIP-seq reveals that global effects on Pol II-binding are mutually rescued by prp5-GAR and spt8Delta. Inhibited splicing caused by prp5-GAR is also restored by spt8Delta. In vitro assays indicate that Prp5p directly interacts with Spt8p, but not Spt3p. We demonstrate that Prp5p's splicing proofreading is modulated by Spt8p and Spt3p. Therefore, this study reveals that interactions between the TBP-binding module of SAGA and the spliceosomal ATPase Prp5p mediate a balance between transcription initiation/elongation and pre-spliceosome assembly.	Prp5-Spt8/Spt3 interaction mediates a reciprocal coupling between splicing and transcription.	Nucleic acids research	1
32396167	P-bodies (PBs) are cytoplasmic mRNA-protein (mRNP) granules conserved throughout eukaryotes which are implicated in the repression, storage and degradation of mRNAs. PB assembly is driven by proteins with self-interacting and low-complexity domains. Non-translating mRNA also stimulates PB assembly, however no studies to date have explored whether particular mRNA transcripts are more critical than others in facilitating PB assembly. Previous work revealed that rps28bDelta (small ribosomal subunit-28B) mutants do not form PBs under normal growth conditions. Here, we demonstrate that the RPS28B 3'UTR is important for PB assembly, consistent with it harboring a binding site for the PB assembly protein Edc3. However, expression of the RPS28B 3'UTR alone is insufficient to drive PB assembly. Intriguingly, chimeric mRNA studies revealed that Rps28 protein, translated in cis from an mRNA bearing the RPS28B 3'UTR, physically interacts more strongly with Edc3 than Rps28 protein synthesized in trans. This Edc3-Rps28 interaction in turn facilitates PB assembly. Our work indicates that PB assembly may be nucleated by specific RNA 'scaffolds'. Furthermore, this is the first description in yeast to our knowledge of a cis-translated protein interacting with another protein in the 3'UTR of the mRNA which encoded it, which in turn stimulates assembly of cellular structures.	RPS28B mRNA acts as a scaffold promoting cis-translational interaction of proteins driving P-body assembly.	Nucleic acids research	1
32392347	The chromatin organizer SATB1 is highly enriched in thymocytes and is essential for T-cell development. Although SATB1 regulates a large number of genes important for T-cell development, the mechanism(s) regulating expression of SATB1 during this process remain elusive. Using chromatin immune precipitation-seq-based occupancy profiles of H3K4me3 and H3Kme1 at Satb1 gene locus, we predicted four different alternative promoters of Satb1 in mouse thymocytes and characterized them. The expression of Satb1 transcript variants with distinct 5' UTRs occurs in a stage-specific manner during T-cell development and is dependent on TCR signaling. The observed discrepancy between the expression levels of SATB1 mRNA and protein in developing thymocytes can be explained by the differential translatability of Satb1 transcript variants as confirmed by polysome profiling and in vitro translation assay. We show that Satb1 alternative promoters exhibit lineage-specific chromatin accessibility during T-cell development from progenitors. Furthermore, TCF1 regulates the Satb1 P2 promoter switch during CD4SP development, via direct binding to the Satb1 P2 promoter. CD4SP T cells from TCF1 KO mice exhibit downregulation of P2 transcript variant expression as well as low levels of SATB1 protein. Collectively, these results provide unequivocal evidence toward alternative promoter switch-mediated developmental stage-specific regulation of SATB1 in thymocytes.

32356875	Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2) reverses Topoisomerase 2 DNA-protein crosslinks (TOP2-DPCs) in a direct-reversal pathway licensed by ZATTZNF451 SUMO2 E3 ligase and SUMOylation of TOP2. TDP2 also binds ubiquitin (Ub), but how Ub regulates TDP2 functions is unknown. Here, we show that TDP2 co-purifies with K63 and K27 poly-Ubiquitinated cellular proteins independently of, and separately from SUMOylated TOP2 complexes. Poly-ubiquitin chains of >/= Ub3 stimulate TDP2 catalytic activity in nuclear extracts and enhance TDP2 binding of DNA-protein crosslinks in vitro. X-ray crystal structures and small-angle X-ray scattering analysis of TDP2-Ub complexes reveal that the TDP2 UBA domain binds K63-Ub3 in a 1:1 stoichiometric complex that relieves a UBA-regulated autoinhibitory state of TDP2. Our data indicates that that poly-Ub regulates TDP2-catalyzed TOP2-DPC removal, and TDP2 single nucleotide polymorphisms can disrupt the TDP2-Ubiquitin interface.

32479628	The nucleolus is a membrane-less nuclear structure that disassembles when cells undergo mitosis. During mitosis, nucleolar factors are thus released from the nucleolus and dynamically change their subcellular localization; however, their functions remain largely uncharacterised. Here, we found that a nucleolar factor called nucleolar protein 11 (NOL11) forms a protein complex with two tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) repeat proteins named WD-repeat protein 43 (WDR43) and Cirhin in mitotic cells. This complex, referred to here as the NWC (NOL11-WDR43-Cirhin) complex, exists in nucleoli during interphase and translocates to the periphery of mitotic chromosomes, i.e., perichromosomal regions. During mitotic progression, both the congression of chromosomes to the metaphase plate and sister chromatid cohesion are impaired in the absence of the NWC complex, as it is required for the centromeric enrichment of Aurora B and the associating phosphorylation of histone H3 at threonine 3. These results reveal the characteristics of a novel protein complex consisting of nucleolar proteins, which is required for regulating kinetochores and centromeres to ensure faithful chromosome segregation.

32463460	Repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) with homologous chromosomes is a hallmark of meiosis that is mediated by recombination 'bridges' between homolog axes. This process requires cooperation of DMC1 and RAD51 to promote homology search and strand exchange. The mechanism(s) regulating DMC1/RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament and the components of 'bridges' remain to be investigated. Here we show that MEIOK21 is a newly identified component of meiotic recombination bridges and is required for efficient formation of DMC1/RAD51 foci. MEIOK21 dynamically localizes on chromosomes from on-axis foci to 'hanging foci', then to 'bridges', and finally to 'fused foci' between homolog axes. Its chromosome localization depends on DSBs. Knockout of Meiok21 decreases the numbers of HSF2BP and DMC1/RAD51 foci, disrupting DSB repair, synapsis and crossover recombination and finally causing male infertility. Therefore, MEIOK21 is a novel recombination factor and probably mediates DMC1/RAD51 recruitment to ssDNA or their stability on chromosomes through physical interaction with HSF2BP.

32449921	Mitoribosome biogenesis is an expensive metabolic process that is essential to maintain cellular respiratory capacity and requires the stoichiometric accumulation of rRNAs and proteins encoded in two distinct genomes. In yeast, the ribosomal protein Var1, alias uS3m, is mitochondrion-encoded. uS3m is a protein universally present in all ribosomes, where it forms part of the small subunit (SSU) mRNA entry channel and plays a pivotal role in ribosome loading onto the mRNA. However, despite its critical functional role, very little is known concerning VAR1 gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that the protein Sov1 is an in bona fide VAR1 mRNA translational activator and additionally interacts with newly synthesized Var1 polypeptide. Moreover, we show that Sov1 assists the late steps of mtSSU biogenesis involving the incorporation of Var1, an event necessary for uS14 and mS46 assembly. Notably, we have uncovered a translational regulatory mechanism by which Sov1 fine-tunes Var1 synthesis with its assembly into the mitoribosome.	The translational activator Sov1 coordinates mitochondrial gene expression with mitoribosome biogenesis.	Nucleic acids research	1
32813009	N 6-methylation of 2'-O-methyladenosine (Am) in RNA occurs in eukaryotic cells to generate N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am). Identification of the methyltransferase responsible for m6Am catalysis has accelerated studies on the function of m6Am in RNA processing. While m6Am is generally found in the first transcribed nucleotide of mRNAs, the modification is also found internally within U2 snRNA. However, the writer required for catalyzing internal m6Am formation had remained elusive. By sequencing transcriptome-wide RNA methylation at single-base-resolution, we identified human METTL4 as the writer that directly methylates Am at U2 snRNA position 30 into m6Am. We found that METTL4 localizes to the nucleus and its conserved methyltransferase catalytic site is required for U2 snRNA methylation. By sequencing human cells with overexpressed Mettl4, we determined METTL4's in vivo target RNA motif specificity. In the absence of Mettl4 in human cells, U2 snRNA lacks m6Am thereby affecting a subset of splicing events that exhibit specific features such as 3' splice-site weakness and an increase in exon inclusion. These findings suggest that METTL4 methylation of U2 snRNA regulates splicing of specific pre-mRNA transcripts.	METTL4 catalyzes m6Am methylation in U2 snRNA to regulate pre-mRNA splicing.

33035348	The microprocessor complex cleaves the primary transcript of microRNA (pri-miRNA) to initiate miRNA maturation. Microprocessor is known to consist of RNase III DROSHA and dsRNA-binding DGCR8. Here, we identify Enhancer of Rudimentary Homolog (ERH) as a new component of Microprocessor. Through a crystal structure and biochemical experiments, we reveal that ERH uses its hydrophobic groove to bind to a conserved region in the N-terminus of DGCR8, in a 2:2 stoichiometry. Knock-down of ERH or deletion of the DGCR8 N-terminus results in a reduced processing of suboptimal pri-miRNAs in polycistronic miRNA clusters. ERH increases the processing of suboptimal pri-miR-451 in a manner dependent on its neighboring pri-miR-144. Thus, the ERH dimer may mediate 'cluster assistance' in which Microprocessor is loaded onto a poor substrate with help from a high-affinity substrate in the same cluster. Our study reveals a role of ERH in the miRNA biogenesis pathway.	ERH facilitates microRNA maturation through the interaction with the N-terminus of DGCR8.	Nucleic acids research	0
33010166	In yeast, NuA3 histone acetyltransferase (NuA3 HAT) promotes acetylation of histone H3 lysine 14 (H3K14) and transcription of a subset of genes through interaction between the Yng1 plant homeodomain (PHD) finger and H3K4me3. Although NuA3 HAT has multiple chromatin binding modules with distinct specificities, their interdependence and combinatorial actions in chromatin binding and transcription remain unknown. Modified peptide pulldown assays reveal that the Yng1 N-terminal region is important for the integrity of NuA3 HAT by mediating the interaction between core subunits and two methyl-binding proteins, Yng1 and Pdp3. We further uncover that NuA3 HAT contributes to the regulation of mRNA and lncRNA expression dynamics by antagonizing the histone deacetylases (HDACs) Rpd3S and Rpd3L. The Yng1 N-terminal region, the Nto1 PHD finger and Pdp3 are important for optimal induction of mRNA and lncRNA transcription repressed by the Set2-Rpd3S HDAC pathway, whereas the Yng1 PHD finger-H3K4me3 interaction affects transcriptional repression memory regulated by Rpd3L HDAC. These findings suggest that NuA3 HAT uses distinct chromatin readers to compete with two Rpd3-containing HDACs to optimize mRNA and lncRNA expression dynamics.

32986841	Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) signaling pathway is essential for ERalpha-positive breast cancer progression and endocrine therapy resistance. Bromodomain PHD Finger Transcription Factor (BPTF) associated protein of 18kDa (BAP18) has been recognized as a crucial H3K4me3 reader. However, the whole genomic occupation of BAP18 and its biological function in breast cancer is still elusive. Here, we found that higher expression of BAP18 in ERalpha-positive breast cancer is positively correlated with poor prognosis. ChIP-seq analysis further demonstrated that the half estrogen response elements (EREs) and the CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) binding sites are the significant enrichment sites found in estrogen-induced BAP18 binding sites. Also, we provide the evidence to demonstrate that BAP18 as a novel co-activator of ERalpha is required for the recruitment of COMPASS-like core subunits to the cis-regulatory element of ERalpha target genes in breast cancer cells. BAP18 is recruited to the promoter regions of estrogen-induced genes, accompanied with the enrichment of the lysine 4-trimethylated histone H3 tail (H3K4me3) in the presence of E2. Furthermore, BAP18 promotes cell growth and associates the sensitivity of antiestrogen in ERalpha-positive breast cancer. Our data suggest that BAP18 facilitates the association between ERalpha and COMPASS-like core subunits, which might be an essential epigenetic therapeutic target for breast cancer.

33231681	Vascular endothelial zinc finger 1 (VEZF1) plays important roles in endothelial lineage definition and angiogenesis. Vasohibins 1 and 2 (VASH1 and VASH2) can form heterodimers with small vasohibin-binding protein (SVBP) and were recently shown to regulate angiogenesis by acting as tubulin detyrosinases. Here, we showed that VEZF1 binds directly with DNA guanine quadruplex (G quadruplex, G4) structures in vitro and in cells, which modulates the levels of the two isoforms of VASH1 mRNA. Disruption of this interaction, through genetic depletion of VEZF1 or treatment of cells with G4-stabilizing small molecules, led to increased production of the long over short isoform of VASH1 (i.e. VASH1A and VASH1B, respectively) mRNA and elevated tubulin detyrosinase activity in cells. Moreover, disruption of VEZF1-G4 interactions in human umbilical vein endothelial cells resulted in diminished angiogenesis. These results suggest that the interaction between VEZF1 and G4 structures assumes a crucial role in angiogenesis, which occurs through regulating the relative levels of the two isoforms of VASH1 mRNA and the detyrosinase activity of the VASH1-SVBP complex. Together, our work revealed VEZF1 as a G4-binding protein, identified a novel regulatory mechanism for tubulin detyrosinase, and illustrated that the VEZF1- and VASH1-mediated angiogenesis pathways are functionally connected.

33170271	LSH, a SNF2 family DNA helicase, is a key regulator of DNA methylation in mammals. How LSH facilitates DNA methylation is not well defined. While previous studies with mouse embryonic stem cells (mESc) and fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Lsh knockout mice have revealed a role of Lsh in de novo DNA methylation by Dnmt3a/3b, here we report that LSH contributes to DNA methylation in various cell lines primarily by promoting DNA methylation by DNMT1. We show that loss of LSH has a much bigger effect in DNA methylation than loss of DNMT3A and DNMT3B. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that LSH interacts with UHRF1 but not DNMT1 and facilitates UHRF1 chromatin association and UHRF1-catalyzed histone H3 ubiquitination in an ATPase activity-dependent manner, which in turn promotes DNMT1 recruitment to replication fork and DNA methylation. Notably, UHRF1 also enhances LSH association with the replication fork. Thus, our study identifies LSH as an essential factor for DNA methylation by DNMT1 and provides novel insight into how a feed-forward loop between LSH and UHRF1 facilitates DNMT1-mediated maintenance of DNA methylation in chromatin.

33245769	Bcl-2 phosphorylation at serine-70 (S70pBcl2) confers resistance against drug-induced apoptosis. Nevertheless, its specific mechanism in driving drug-resistance remains unclear. We present evidence that S70pBcl2 promotes cancer cell survival by acting as a redox sensor and modulator to prevent oxidative stress-induced DNA damage and execution. Increased S70pBcl2 levels are inversely correlated with DNA damage in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and lymphoma patient-derived primary cells as well as in reactive oxygen species (ROS)- or chemotherapeutic drug-treated cell lines. Bioinformatic analyses suggest that S70pBcl2 is associated with lower median overall survival in lymphoma patients. Empirically, sustained expression of the redox-sensitive S70pBcl2 prevents oxidative stress-induced DNA damage and cell death by suppressing mitochondrial ROS production. Using cell lines and lymphoma primary cells, we further demonstrate that S70pBcl2 reduces the interaction of Bcl-2 with the mitochondrial complex-IV subunit-5A, thereby reducing mitochondrial complex-IV activity, respiration and ROS production. Notably, targeting S70pBcl2 with the phosphatase activator, FTY720, is accompanied by an enhanced drug-induced DNA damage and cell death in CLL primary cells. Collectively, we provide a novel facet of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 by demonstrating that its phosphorylation at serine-70 functions as a redox sensor to prevent drug-induced oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage and execution with potential therapeutic implications.

33410907	Pin1 is a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that regulates the structure and function of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (Pol II) through interaction with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Rpb1, the largest subunit of Pol II. We demonstrated that this function is important for cellular response to oxidative stress in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In response to oxidative stress, the Atf1 transcription factor targets Sty1, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), to specific stress-responsive promoters. Anchored Sty1 recruits Pol II through direct association with Rpb1-CTD and phosphorylates the reiterated heptad sequence at Serine 5. Pin1 binds phosphorylated CTD to promote dissociation of Sty1 from it, and directly recruits Ssu72 phosphatase to facilitate dephosphorylation of CTD for transcription elongation. In the absence of Pin1, the association of Sty1-Atf1 with Rpb1 persists on stress-responsive promoters failed to generate transcripts of the corresponding genes effectively. The identified characteristic features of the fission yeast Pin1 are conserved in humans. We demonstrated that elevated Pin1 level in cancer cells might help to sustain survival under oxidative stress generated from their altered metabolic pathways. Together, these results suggest a conserved function of Pin1 in cellular response to oxidative stress among eukaryotic cells that might have clinical implication.

33367824	The PAQosome is a large complex composed of the HSP90/R2TP chaperone and a prefoldin-like module. It promotes the biogenesis of cellular machineries but it is unclear how it discriminates closely related client proteins. Among the main PAQosome clients are C/D snoRNPs and in particular their core protein NOP58. Using NOP58 mutants and proteomic experiments, we identify different assembly intermediates and show that C12ORF45, which we rename NOPCHAP1, acts as a bridge between NOP58 and PAQosome. NOPCHAP1 makes direct physical interactions with the CC-NOP domain of NOP58 and domain II of RUVBL1/2 AAA+ ATPases. Interestingly, NOPCHAP1 interaction with RUVBL1/2 is disrupted upon ATP binding. Moreover, while it robustly binds both yeast and human NOP58, it makes little interactions with NOP56 and PRPF31, two other closely related CC-NOP proteins. Expression of NOP58, but not NOP56 or PRPF31, is decreased in NOPCHAP1 KO cells. We propose that NOPCHAP1 is a client-loading PAQosome cofactor that selects NOP58 to promote box C/D snoRNP assembly.

33444449	Pre-mRNA splicing catalyzed by the spliceosome represents a critical step in the regulation of gene expression contributing to transcriptome and proteome diversity. The spliceosome consists of five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs), the biogenesis of which remains only partially understood. Here we define the evolutionarily conserved protein Ecdysoneless (Ecd) as a critical regulator of U5 snRNP assembly and Prp8 stability. Combining Drosophila genetics with proteomic approaches, we demonstrate the Ecd requirement for the maintenance of adult healthspan and lifespan and identify the Sm ring protein SmD3 as a novel interaction partner of Ecd. We show that the predominant task of Ecd is to deliver Prp8 to the emerging U5 snRNPs in the cytoplasm. Ecd deficiency, on the other hand, leads to reduced Prp8 protein levels and compromised U5 snRNP biogenesis, causing loss of splicing fidelity and transcriptome integrity. Based on our findings, we propose that Ecd chaperones Prp8 to the forming U5 snRNP allowing completion of the cytoplasmic part of the U5 snRNP biogenesis pathway necessary to meet the cellular demand for functional spliceosomes.	Ecd promotes U5 snRNP maturation and Prp8 stability.	Nucleic acids research	0
33444446	Alkylating drugs are among the most often used chemotherapeutics. While cancer cells frequently develop resistance to alkylation treatments, detailed understanding of mechanisms that lead to the resistance is limited. Here, by using genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 based screen, we identify transcriptional Mediator complex subunit 13 (MED13) as a novel modulator of alkylation response. The alkylation exposure causes significant MED13 downregulation, while complete loss of MED13 results in reduced apoptosis and resistance to alkylating agents. Transcriptome analysis identified cyclin D1 (CCND1) as one of the highly overexpressed genes in MED13 knock-out (KO) cells, characterized by shorter G1 phase. MED13 is able to bind to CCND1 regulatory elements thus influencing the expression. The resistance of MED13 KO cells is directly dependent on the cyclin D1 overexpression, and its down-regulation is sufficient to re-sensitize the cells to alkylating agents. We further demonstrate the therapeutic potential of MED13-mediated response, by applying combinatory treatment with CDK8/19 inhibitor Senexin A. Importantly, the treatment with Senexin A stabilizes MED13, and in combination with alkylating agents significantly reduces viability of cancer cells. In summary, our findings identify novel alkylation stress response mechanism dependent on MED13 and cyclin D1 that can serve as basis for development of innovative therapeutic strategies.

33533922	The integrity and regulation of the nuclear lamina is essential for nuclear organization and chromatin stability, with its dysregulation being linked to laminopathy diseases and cancer. Although numerous posttranslational modifications have been identified on lamins, few have been ascribed a regulatory function. Here, we establish that lamin B1 (LMNB1) acetylation at K134 is a molecular toggle that controls nuclear periphery stability, cell cycle progression, and DNA repair. LMNB1 acetylation prevents lamina disruption during herpesvirus type 1 (HSV-1) infection, thereby inhibiting virus production. We also demonstrate the broad impact of this site on laminar processes in uninfected cells. LMNB1 acetylation negatively regulates canonical nonhomologous end joining by impairing the recruitment of 53BP1 to damaged DNA. This defect causes a delay in DNA damage resolution and a persistent activation of the G1/S checkpoint. Altogether, we reveal LMNB1 acetylation as a mechanism for controlling DNA repair pathway choice and stabilizing the nuclear periphery.	Lamin B1 acetylation slows the G1 to S cell cycle transition through inhibition of DNA repair.	Nucleic acids research	0
33577677	N 6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant modification within diverse RNAs including mRNAs and lncRNAs and is regulated by a reversible process with important biological functions. Human YTH domain family 2 (YTHDF2) selectively recognized m6A-RNAs to regulate degradation. However, the possible regulation of YTHDF2 by protein post-translational modification remains unknown. Here, we show that YTHDF2 is SUMOylated in vivo and in vitro at the major site of K571, which can be induced by hypoxia while reduced by oxidative stress and SUMOylation inhibitors. SUMOylation of YTHDF2 has little impact on its ubiquitination and localization, but significantly increases its binding affinity of m6A-modified mRNAs and subsequently results in deregulated gene expressions which accounts for cancer progression. Moreover, Disease-free survival analysis of patients with lung adenocarcinoma derived from TCGA dataset reveals that higher expression of YTHDF2 together with higher expression of SUMO1 predicts poor prognosis. Our works uncover a new regulatory mechanism for YTHDF2 recognition of m6A-RNAs and highlight the importance of YTHDF2 SUMOylation in post-transcriptional gene expression regulation and cancer progression.

33764436	Epigenetic regulation of cell and tissue function requires the coordinated action of transcription factors. However, their combinatorial activities during regeneration remain largely unexplored. Here, we discover an unexpected interaction between the cytoprotective transcription factor NRF2 and p63- a key player in epithelial morphogenesis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with sequencing and reporter assays identifies enhancers and promoters that are simultaneously activated by NRF2 and p63 in human keratinocytes. Modeling of p63 and NRF2 binding to nucleosomal DNA suggests their chromatin-assisted interaction. Pharmacological and genetic activation of NRF2 increases NRF2-p63 binding to enhancers and promotes keratinocyte proliferation, which involves the common NRF2-p63 target cyclin-dependent kinase 12. These results unravel a collaborative function of NRF2 and p63 in the control of epidermal renewal and suggest their combined activation as a strategy to promote repair of human skin and other stratified epithelia.

33823531	Meiotic recombination ensures proper chromosome segregation to form viable gametes and results in gene conversions events between homologs. Conversion tracts are shorter in meiosis than in mitotically dividing cells. This results at least in part from the binding of a complex, containing the Mer3 helicase and the MutLbeta heterodimer, to meiotic recombination intermediates. The molecular actors inhibited by this complex are elusive. The Pif1 DNA helicase is known to stimulate DNA polymerase delta (Pol delta) -mediated DNA synthesis from D-loops, allowing long synthesis required for break-induced replication. We show that Pif1 is also recruited genome wide to meiotic DNA double-strand break (DSB) sites. We further show that Pif1, through its interaction with PCNA, is required for the long gene conversions observed in the absence of MutLbeta recruitment to recombination sites. In vivo, Mer3 interacts with the PCNA clamp loader RFC, and in vitro, Mer3-MutLbeta ensemble inhibits Pif1-stimulated D-loop extension by Pol delta and RFC-PCNA. Mechanistically, our results suggest that Mer3-MutLbeta may compete with Pif1 for binding to RFC-PCNA. Taken together, our data show that Pif1's activity that promotes meiotic DNA repair synthesis is restrained by the Mer3-MutLbeta ensemble which in turn prevents long gene conversion tracts and possibly associated mutagenesis.	The Pif1 helicase is actively inhibited during meiotic recombination which restrains gene conversion tract length.	Nucleic acids research	0
33999206	The intestinal invasion of pathogenic microorganisms can have serious health consequences. Recent evidence has shown that the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA modification is closely associated with innate immunity; however, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we examined the function and mechanism of m6A mRNA modification and the YTH domain-containing protein YTHDF1 (YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA-binding protein 1) in the innate immune response against bacterial pathogens in the intestine. Ribo-seq and m6A-seq analyses revealed that YTHDF1 directs the translation of Traf6 mRNA, which encodes tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6, thereby regulating the immune response via the m6A modification near the transcript's stop codon. Furthermore, we identified a unique mechanism by which the P/Q/N-rich domain in YTHDF1 interacts with the DEAD domain in the host factor DDX60, thereby regulating the intestinal immune response to bacterial infection by recognizing the target Traf6 transcript. These results provide novel insights into the mechanism by which YTHDF1 recognizes its target and reveal YTHDF1 as an important driver of the intestinal immune response, opening new avenues for developing therapeutic strategies designed to modulate the intestinal immune response to bacterial infection.

34107030	Epigenetics, especially histone marks, functions beyond the DNA sequences to regulate gene expression. Depletion of NSD1, which catalyzes H3K36me2, leads to both up- and down-regulation of gene expression, indicating NSD1 is associated with both active and repressed gene expression. It's known that NSD1 regulates the deposition and expansion of H3K27me3, a repressive mark for gene expression, to keep active gene transcription. However, how NSD1 functions to repress gene expression is largely unknown. Here, we find that, when NSD1 is knocked out in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), H3K27ac increases correlatively with the decrease of H3K36me2 at active enhancers, which is associated with mesoderm differentiation genes, leading to elevated gene expression. Mechanistically, NSD1 recruits HDAC1, the deacetylase of H3K27ac, to chromatin. Moreover, HDAC1 knockout (KO) recapitulates the increase of H3K27ac at active enhancers as the NSD1 depletion. Together, we propose that NSD1 deposits H3K36me2 and recruits HDAC1 at active enhancers to serve as a 'safeguard', preventing further activation of active enhancer-associated genes.	The H3K36me2 methyltransferase NSD1 modulates H3K27ac at active enhancers to safeguard gene expression.	Nucleic acids research	1
34157114	Rad51 is the key protein in homologous recombination that plays important roles during DNA replication and repair. Auxiliary factors regulate Rad51 activity to facilitate productive recombination, and prevent inappropriate, untimely or excessive events, which could lead to genome instability. Previous genetic analyses identified a function for Rrp1 (a member of the Rad5/16-like group of SWI2/SNF2 translocases) in modulating Rad51 function, shared with the Rad51 mediator Swi5-Sfr1 and the Srs2 anti-recombinase. Here, we show that Rrp1 overproduction alleviates the toxicity associated with excessive Rad51 levels in a manner dependent on Rrp1 ATPase domain. Purified Rrp1 binds to DNA and has a DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Importantly, Rrp1 directly interacts with Rad51 and removes it from double-stranded DNA, confirming that Rrp1 is a translocase capable of modulating Rad51 function. Rrp1 affects Rad51 binding at centromeres. Additionally, we demonstrate in vivo and in vitro that Rrp1 possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity with Rad51 as a substrate, suggesting that Rrp1 regulates Rad51 in a multi-tiered fashion.	Rrp1 translocase and ubiquitin ligase activities restrict the genome destabilising effects of Rad51 in fission yeast.	Nucleic acids research	0
33377866	Accurate chromosome segregation requires kinetochores on duplicated chromatids to biorient by attaching to dynamic microtubules from opposite spindle poles, which exerts forces to bring kinetochores under tension. However, kinetochores initially bind to microtubules indiscriminately, resulting in errors that must be corrected. While the Aurora B protein kinase destabilizes low-tension attachments by phosphorylating kinetochores, low-tension attachments are intrinsically less stable than those under higher tension in vitro independent of Aurora activity. Intrinsic tension-sensitive behavior requires the microtubule regulator Stu2 (budding yeast Dis1/XMAP215 ortholog), which we demonstrate here is likely a conserved function for the TOG protein family. The human TOG protein, chTOG, localizes to kinetochores independent of microtubules by interacting with Hec1. We identify a chTOG mutant that regulates microtubule dynamics but accumulates erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments that are not destabilized by Aurora B. Thus, TOG proteins confer a unique, intrinsic error correction activity to kinetochores that ensures accurate chromosome segregation.	chTOG is a conserved mitotic error correction factor.	eLife	0
33373293	Bone remodeling involves a balance between bone resorption and formation. The mechanisms underlying bone remodeling are not well understood. DEF6 is recently identified as a novel loci associated with bone mineral density. However, it is unclear how Def6 impacts bone remodeling. We identify Def6 as a novel osteoblastic regulator that suppresses osteoblastogenesis and bone formation. Def6 deficiency enhances both bone resorption and osteogenesis. The enhanced bone resorption in Def6(-/-) mice dominates, leading to osteoporosis. Mechanistically, Def6 inhibits the differentiation of both osteoclasts and osteoblasts via a common mechanism through endogenous type-I IFN-mediated feedback inhibition. RNAseq analysis shows expression of a group of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) during osteoblastogenesis. Furthermore, we found that Def6 is a key upstream regulator of IFNbeta and ISG expression in osteoblasts. Collectively, our results identify a novel immunoregulatory function of Def6 in bone remodeling, and shed insights into the interaction between immune system and bone.	Def6 regulates endogenous type-I interferon responses in osteoblasts and suppresses osteogenesis.	eLife	0
33320092	It has been known adipocytes increase p53 expression and activity in obesity, however, only canonical p53 functions (i.e. senescence and apoptosis) are attributed to inflammation-associated metabolic phenotypes. Whether or not p53 is directly involved in mature adipocyte metabolic regulation remains unclear. Here we show p53 protein expression can be up-regulated in adipocytes by nutrient starvation without activating cell senescence, apoptosis, or a death-related p53 canonical pathway. Inducing the loss of p53 in mature adipocytes significantly reprograms energy metabolism and this effect is primarily mediated through a AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and a novel downstream transcriptional target, lysosomal acid lipase (LAL). The pathophysiological relevance is further demonstrated in a conditional and adipocyte-specific p53 knockout mouse model. Overall, these data support a non-canonical p53 function in the regulation of adipocyte energy homeostasis and indicate that the dysregulation of this pathway may be involved in developing metabolic dysfunction in obesity.	An AMPK-dependent, non-canonical p53 pathway plays a key role in adipocyte metabolic reprogramming.	eLife	0
33287957	Liver metabolism follows diurnal fluctuations through the modulation of molecular clock genes. Disruption of this molecular clock can result in metabolic disease but its potential regulation by immune cells remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrated that in steady state, neutrophils infiltrated the mouse liver following a circadian pattern and regulated hepatocyte clock-genes by neutrophil elastase (NE) secretion. NE signals through c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibiting fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and activating Bmal1 expression in the hepatocyte. Interestingly, mice with neutropenia, defective neutrophil infiltration or lacking elastase were protected against steatosis correlating with lower JNK activation, reduced Bmal1 and increased FGF21 expression, together with decreased lipogenesis in the liver. Lastly, using a cohort of human samples we found a direct correlation between JNK activation, NE levels and Bmal1 expression in the liver. This study demonstrates that neutrophils contribute to the maintenance of daily hepatic homeostasis through the regulation of the NE/JNK/Bmal1 axis.

33210603	The soluble isoform of leptin receptor (sOb-R), secreted by the liver, regulates leptin bioavailability and bioactivity. Its reduced levels in diet-induced obesity (DIO) contribute to hyperleptinemia and leptin resistance, effects that are regulated by the endocannabinoid (eCB)/CB1R system. Here we show that pharmacological activation/blockade and genetic overexpression/deletion of hepatic CB1R modulates sOb-R levels and hepatic leptin resistance. Interestingly, peripheral CB1R blockade failed to reverse DIO-induced reduction of sOb-R levels, increased fat mass and dyslipidemia, and hepatic steatosis in mice lacking C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), whereas direct activation of CB1R in wild-type hepatocytes reduced sOb-R levels in a CHOP-dependent manner. Moreover, CHOP stimulation increased sOb-R expression and release via a direct regulation of its promoter, while CHOP deletion reduced leptin sensitivity. Our findings highlight a novel molecular aspect by which the hepatic eCB/CB1R system is involved in the development of hepatic leptin resistance and in the regulation of sOb-R levels via CHOP.	CB1R regulates soluble leptin receptor levels via CHOP, contributing to hepatic leptin resistance.	eLife	0
33185187	Epithelial cells possess intrinsic mechanisms to maintain an appropriate cell density for normal tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis. Defects in such mechanisms likely contribute to hyperplasia and cancer initiation. To identify genes that regulate the density-dependent proliferation of murine mammary epithelial cells, we developed a fluorescence-activated cell sorting assay based on fluorescence ubiquitination cell cycle indicator, which marks different stages of the cell cycle with distinct fluorophores. Using this powerful assay, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen, selecting for cells that proliferate normally at low density but continue to divide at high density. Unexpectedly, one top hit was Traf3, a negative regulator of NF-kappaB signaling that has never previously been linked to density-dependent proliferation. We demonstrate that loss of Traf3 specifically activates noncanonical NF-kappaB signaling. This in turn triggers an innate immune response and drives cell division independently of known density-dependent proliferation mechanisms, including YAP/TAZ signaling and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, by blocking entry into quiescence.	Genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies noncanonical NF-kappaB signaling as a regulator of density-dependent proliferation.	eLife	1
33135636	P2X7 receptor activation induces the release of different cellular proteins, such as CD14, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein to the plasma membrane important for LPS signaling via TLR4. Circulating CD14 has been found at elevated levels in sepsis, but the exact mechanism of CD14 release in sepsis has not been established. Here, we show for first time that P2X7 receptor induces the release of CD14 in extracellular vesicles, resulting in a net reduction in macrophage plasma membrane CD14 that functionally affects LPS, but not monophosphoryl lipid A, pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Also, we found that during a murine model of sepsis, P2X7 receptor activity is important for maintaining elevated levels of CD14 in biological fluids and a decrease in its activity results in higher bacterial load and exacerbated organ damage, ultimately leading to premature deaths. Our data reveal that P2X7 is a key receptor for helping to clear sepsis because it maintains elevated concentrations of circulating CD14 during infection.	CD14 release induced by P2X7 receptor restricts inflammation and increases survival during sepsis.	eLife	0
33074099	Ubiquitination regulates many different cellular processes, including protein quality control, membrane trafficking, and stress responses. The diversity of ubiquitin functions in the cell is partly due to its ability to form chains with distinct linkages that can alter the fate of substrate proteins in unique ways. The complexity of the ubiquitin code is further enhanced by post-translational modifications on ubiquitin itself, the biological functions of which are not well understood. Here, we present genetic and biochemical evidence that serine 57 (Ser57) phosphorylation of ubiquitin functions in stress responses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, including the oxidative stress response. We also identify and characterize the first known Ser57 ubiquitin kinases in yeast and human cells, and we report that two Ser57 ubiquitin kinases regulate the oxidative stress response in yeast. These studies implicate ubiquitin phosphorylation at the Ser57 position as an important modifier of ubiquitin function, particularly in response to proteotoxic stress.

33051000	WNK1, a kinase that controls kidney salt homeostasis, also regulates adhesion and migration in CD4(+) T cells. Wnk1 is highly expressed in thymocytes, and since migration is important for thymocyte maturation, we investigated a role for WNK1 in mouse thymocyte development. We find that WNK1 is required for the transition of double negative (DN) thymocytes through the beta-selection checkpoint and subsequent proliferation and differentiation into double positive (DP) thymocytes. Furthermore, we show that WNK1 negatively regulates LFA1-mediated adhesion and positively regulates CXCL12-induced migration in DN thymocytes. Despite this, migration defects of WNK1-deficient thymocytes do not account for the developmental arrest. Instead, we show that in DN thymocytes WNK1 transduces pre-TCR signals via OXSR1 and STK39 kinases, and the SLC12A2 ion co-transporter that are required for post-transcriptional upregulation of MYC and subsequent proliferation and differentiation into DP thymocytes. Thus, a pathway regulating ion homeostasis is a critical regulator of thymocyte development.	Critical role of WNK1 in MYC-dependent early mouse thymocyte development.	eLife	0
33047671	Meiotic recombination starts with the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at specific genomic locations that correspond to PRDM9-binding sites. The molecular steps occurring from PRDM9 binding to DSB formation are unknown. Using proteomic approaches to find PRDM9 partners, we identified HELLS, a member of the SNF2-like family of chromatin remodelers. Upon functional analyses during mouse male meiosis, we demonstrated that HELLS is required for PRDM9 binding and DSB activity at PRDM9 sites. However, HELLS is not required for DSB activity at PRDM9-independent sites. HELLS is also essential for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) enrichment at PRDM9 sites. Analyses of 5hmC in mice deficient for SPO11, which catalyzes DSB formation, and in PRDM9 methyltransferase deficient mice reveal that 5hmC is triggered at DSB-prone sites upon PRDM9 binding and histone modification, but independent of DSB activity. These findings highlight the complex regulation of the chromatin and epigenetic environments at PRDM9-specified hotspots.	PRDM9 activity depends on HELLS and promotes local 5-hydroxymethylcytosine enrichment.	eLife	1
32975514	Matriglycan [-GlcA-beta1,3-Xyl-alpha1,3-]n serves as a scaffold in many tissues for extracellular matrix proteins containing laminin-G domains including laminin, agrin, and perlecan. Like-acetyl-glucosaminyltransferase 1 (LARGE1) synthesizes and extends matriglycan on alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG) during skeletal muscle differentiation and regeneration; however, the mechanisms which regulate matriglycan elongation are unknown. Here, we show that Protein O-Mannose Kinase (POMK), which phosphorylates mannose of core M3 (GalNAc-beta1,3-GlcNAc-beta1,4-Man) preceding matriglycan synthesis, is required for LARGE1-mediated generation of full-length matriglycan on alpha-DG (~150 kDa). In the absence of Pomk gene expression in mouse skeletal muscle, LARGE1 synthesizes a very short matriglycan resulting in a ~ 90 kDa alpha-DG which binds laminin but cannot prevent eccentric contraction-induced force loss or muscle pathology. Solution NMR spectroscopy studies demonstrate that LARGE1 directly interacts with core M3 and binds preferentially to the phosphorylated form. Collectively, our study demonstrates that phosphorylation of core M3 by POMK enables LARGE1 to elongate matriglycan on alpha-DG, thereby preventing muscular dystrophy.	POMK regulates dystroglycan function via LARGE1-mediated elongation of matriglycan.	eLife	0
32924931	Wnt signaling through the Frizzled (FZD) family of serpentine receptors is essential for embryogenesis and homeostasis, and stringent control of the FZD protein level is critical for stem cell regulation. Through CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide screening in human cells, we identified TMEM79/MATTRIN, an orphan multi-span transmembrane protein, as a specific inhibitor of Wnt/FZD signaling. TMEM79 interacts with FZD during biogenesis and promotes FZD degradation independent of ZNRF3/RNF43 ubiquitin ligases (R-spondin receptors). TMEM79 interacts with ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8), whose activating mutations underlie human tumorigenesis. TMEM79 specifically inhibits USP8 deubiquitination of FZD, thereby governing USP8 substrate specificity and promoting FZD degradation. Tmem79 and Usp8 genes have a pre-bilaterian origin, and Tmem79 inhibition of Usp8 and Wnt signaling is required for anterior neural development and gastrulation in Xenopus embryos. TMEM79 is a predisposition gene for Atopic dermatitis, suggesting deregulation of Wnt/FZD signaling a possible cause for this most common yet enigmatic inflammatory skin disease.

32886065	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are by-products of cellular respiration that can promote oxidative stress and damage cellular proteins and lipids. One canonical role of ROS is to defend the cell against invading bacterial and viral pathogens. Curiously, some viruses, including herpesviruses, thrive despite the induction of ROS, suggesting that ROS are beneficial for the virus. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that ROS impaired interferon response during murine herpesvirus infection and that the inhibition occurred downstream of cytoplasmic DNA sensing. We further demonstrated that ROS suppressed the type I interferon response by oxidizing Cysteine 147 on murine stimulator of interferon genes (STING), an ER-associated protein that mediates interferon response after cytoplasmic DNA sensing. This inhibited STING polymerization and activation of downstream signaling events. These data indicate that redox regulation of Cysteine 147 of mouse STING, which is equivalent to Cysteine 148 of human STING, controls interferon production. Together, our findings reveal that ROS orchestrates anti-viral immune responses, which can be exploited by viruses to evade cellular defenses.

32876044	Larval tracheae of Drosophila harbour progenitors of the adult tracheal system (tracheoblasts). Thoracic tracheoblasts are arrested in the G2 phase of the cell cycle in an ATR (mei-41)-Checkpoint Kinase1 (grapes, Chk1) dependent manner prior to mitotic re-entry. Here we investigate developmental regulation of Chk1 activation. We report that Wnt signaling is high in tracheoblasts and this is necessary for high levels of activated (phosphorylated) Chk1. We find that canonical Wnt signaling facilitates this by transcriptional upregulation of Chk1 expression in cells that have ATR kinase activity. Wnt signaling is dependent on four Wnts (Wg, Wnt5, 6,10) that are expressed at high levels in arrested tracheoblasts and are downregulated at mitotic re-entry. Interestingly, none of the Wnts are dispensable and act synergistically to induce Chk1. Finally, we show that downregulation of Wnt signaling and Chk1 expression leads to mitotic re-entry and the concomitant upregulation of Dpp signaling, driving tracheoblast proliferation.	Multiple Wnts act synergistically to induce Chk1/Grapes expression and mediate G2 arrest in Drosophila tracheoblasts.	eLife	0
32851973	Eukaryotes have evolved various quality control mechanisms to promote proteostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Selective removal of certain ER domains via autophagy (termed as ER-phagy) has emerged as a major quality control mechanism. However, the degree to which ER-phagy is employed by other branches of ER-quality control remains largely elusive. Here, we identify a cytosolic protein, C53, that is specifically recruited to autophagosomes during ER-stress, in both plant and mammalian cells. C53 interacts with ATG8 via a distinct binding epitope, featuring a shuffled ATG8 interacting motif (sAIM). C53 senses proteotoxic stress in the ER lumen by forming a tripartite receptor complex with the ER-associated ufmylation ligase UFL1 and its membrane adaptor DDRGK1. The C53/UFL1/DDRGK1 receptor complex is activated by stalled ribosomes and induces the degradation of internal or passenger proteins in the ER. Consistently, the C53 receptor complex and ufmylation mutants are highly susceptible to ER stress. Thus, C53 forms an ancient quality control pathway that bridges selective autophagy with ribosome-associated quality control in the ER.

32851972	Neuronal activity and gene expression in response to the loss of sleep can provide a window into the enigma of sleep function. Sleep loss is associated with brain differential gene expression, an increase in pyramidal cell mEPSC frequency and amplitude, and a characteristic rebound and resolution of slow wave sleep-slow wave activity (SWS-SWA). However, the molecular mechanism(s) mediating the sleep-loss response are not well understood. We show that sleep-loss regulates MEF2C phosphorylation, a key mechanism regulating MEF2C transcriptional activity, and that MEF2C function in postnatal excitatory forebrain neurons is required for the biological events in response to sleep loss in C57BL/6J mice. These include altered gene expression, the increase and recovery of synaptic strength, and the rebound and resolution of SWS-SWA, which implicate MEF2C as an essential regulator of sleep function.

32804080	The eukaryotic replisome assembles around the CMG helicase, which stably associates with DNA replication forks throughout elongation. When replication terminates, CMG is ubiquitylated on its Mcm7 subunit and disassembled by the Cdc48/p97 ATPase. Until now, the regulation that restricts CMG ubiquitylation to termination was unknown, as was the mechanism of disassembly. By reconstituting these processes with purified budding yeast proteins, we show that ubiquitylation is tightly repressed throughout elongation by the Y-shaped DNA structure of replication forks. Termination removes the repressive DNA structure, whereupon long K48-linked ubiquitin chains are conjugated to CMG-Mcm7, dependent on multiple replisome components that bind to the ubiquitin ligase SCF(Dia2). This mechanism pushes CMG beyond a '5-ubiquitin threshold' that is inherent to Cdc48, which specifically unfolds ubiquitylated Mcm7 and thereby disassembles CMG. These findings explain the exquisite regulation of CMG disassembly and provide a general model for the disassembly of ubiquitylated protein complexes by Cdc48.	CMG helicase disassembly is controlled by replication fork DNA, replisome components and a ubiquitin threshold.	eLife	0
32795391	Intracellular transport undergoes remodeling upon cell differentiation, which involves cell type-specific regulators. Bone morphogenetic protein 2-inducible kinase (BMP2K) has been potentially implicated in endocytosis and cell differentiation but its molecular functions remained unknown. We discovered that its longer (L) and shorter (S) splicing variants regulate erythroid differentiation in a manner unexplainable by their involvement in AP-2 adaptor phosphorylation and endocytosis. However, both variants interact with SEC16A and could localize to the juxtanuclear secretory compartment. Variant-specific depletion approach showed that BMP2K isoforms constitute a BMP2K-L/S regulatory system that controls the distribution of SEC16A and SEC24B as well as SEC31A abundance at COPII assemblies. Finally, we found L to promote and S to restrict autophagic degradation and erythroid differentiation. Hence, we propose that BMP2K-L and BMP2K-S differentially regulate abundance and distribution of COPII assemblies as well as autophagy, possibly thereby fine-tuning erythroid differentiation.	Splicing variation of BMP2K balances abundance of COPII assemblies and autophagic degradation in erythroid cells.	eLife	1
32762844	Different subtypes of interneurons, destined for the olfactory bulb, are continuously generated by neural stem cells located in the ventricular and subventricular zones along the lateral forebrain ventricles of mice. Neuronal identity in the olfactory bulb depends on the existence of defined microdomains of pre-determined neural stem cells along the ventricle walls. The molecular mechanisms underlying positional identity of these neural stem cells are poorly understood. Here, we show that the transcription factor Vax1 controls the production of two specific neuronal subtypes. First, it is directly necessary to generate Calbindin expressing interneurons from ventro-lateral progenitors. Second, it represses the generation of dopaminergic neurons by dorsolateral progenitors through inhibition of Pax6 expression. We present data indicating that this repression occurs, at least in part, via activation of microRNA miR-7.

32701054	Eukaryotic replication origins are licensed by the loading of the replicative DNA helicase, Mcm2-7, in inactive double hexameric form around DNA. Subsequent origin activation is under control of multiple protein kinases that either promote or inhibit origin activation, which is important for genome maintenance. Using the reconstituted budding yeast DNA replication system, we find that the flexible N-terminal extension (NTE) of Mcm2 promotes the stable recruitment of Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) to Mcm2-7 double hexamers, which in turn promotes DDK phosphorylation of Mcm4 and -6 and subsequent origin activation. Conversely, we demonstrate that the checkpoint kinase, Rad53, inhibits DDK binding to Mcm2-7 double hexamers. Unexpectedly, this function is not dependent on Rad53 kinase activity, suggesting steric inhibition of DDK by activated Rad53. These findings identify critical determinants of the origin activation reaction and uncover a novel mechanism for checkpoint-dependent origin inhibition.

32697192	Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) employs plethora of mechanisms to hijack the host defence machinery for its successful survival, proliferation and persistence. Here, we show that Mtb upregulates one of the key epigenetic modulators, NAD+ dependent histone deacetylase Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), which upon infection translocate to the nucleus and deacetylates histone H3K18, thus modulating the host transcriptome leading to enhanced macrophage activation. Furthermore, in Mtb specific T cells, SIRT2 deacetylates NFkappaB-p65 at K310 to modulate T helper cell differentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of SIRT2 restricts the intracellular growth of both drug-sensitive and resistant strains of Mtb and enhances the efficacy of front line anti-TB drug Isoniazid in the murine model of infection. SIRT2 inhibitor-treated mice display reduced bacillary load, decreased disease pathology and increased Mtb-specific protective immune responses. Overall, this study provides a link between Mtb infection, epigenetics and host immune response, which can be exploited to achieve therapeutic benefits.

32662771	Mutations in the gene encoding Ras-associated binding protein 23 (RAB23) cause Carpenter Syndrome, which is characterized by multiple developmental abnormalities including polysyndactyly and defects in skull morphogenesis. To understand how RAB23 regulates skull development, we generated Rab23-deficient mice that survive to an age where skeletal development can be studied. Along with polysyndactyly, these mice exhibit premature fusion of multiple sutures resultant from aberrant osteoprogenitor proliferation and elevated osteogenesis in the suture. FGF10-driven FGFR1 signaling is elevated in Rab23(-/-)sutures with a consequent imbalance in MAPK, Hedgehog signaling and RUNX2 expression. Inhibition of elevated pERK1/2 signaling results in the normalization of osteoprogenitor proliferation with a concomitant reduction of osteogenic gene expression, and prevention of craniosynostosis. Our results suggest a novel role for RAB23 as an upstream negative regulator of both FGFR and canonical Hh-GLI1 signaling, and additionally in the non-canonical regulation of GLI1 through pERK1/2.	RAB23 coordinates early osteogenesis by repressing FGF10-pERK1/2 and GLI1.	eLife	0
32657270	Genome-wide association studies identified the BIN1 locus as a leading modulator of genetic risk in Alzheimer's disease (AD). One limitation in understanding BIN1's contribution to AD is its unknown function in the brain. AD-associated BIN1 variants are generally noncoding and likely change expression. Here, we determined the effects of increasing expression of the major neuronal isoform of human BIN1 in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Higher BIN1 induced network hyperexcitability on multielectrode arrays, increased frequency of synaptic transmission, and elevated calcium transients, indicating that increasing BIN1 drives greater neuronal activity. In exploring the mechanism of these effects on neuronal physiology, we found that BIN1 interacted with L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (LVGCCs) and that BIN1-LVGCC interactions were modulated by Tau in rat hippocampal neurons and mouse brain. Finally, Tau reduction prevented BIN1-induced network hyperexcitability. These data shed light on BIN1's neuronal function and suggest that it may contribute to Tau-dependent hyperexcitability in AD.

32648543	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria contact sites (ERMCSs) are crucial for multiple cellular processes such as calcium signaling, lipid transport, and mitochondrial dynamics. However, the molecular organization, functions, regulation of ERMCS, and the physiological roles of altered ERMCSs are not fully understood in higher eukaryotes. We found that Miga, a mitochondrion located protein, markedly increases ERMCSs and causes severe neurodegeneration upon overexpression in fly eyes. Miga interacts with an ER protein Vap33 through its FFAT-like motif and an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) disease related Vap33 mutation considerably reduces its interaction with Miga. Multiple serine residues inside and near the Miga FFAT motif were phosphorylated, which is required for its interaction with Vap33 and Miga-mediated ERMCS formation. The interaction between Vap33 and Miga promoted further phosphorylation of upstream serine/threonine clusters, which fine-tuned Miga activity. Protein kinases CKI and CaMKII contribute to Miga hyperphosphorylation. MIGA2, encoded by the miga mammalian ortholog, has conserved functions in mammalian cells. We propose a model that shows Miga interacts with Vap33 to mediate ERMCSs and excessive ERMCSs lead to neurodegeneration.

32633716	Organ growth and size are finely tuned by intrinsic and extrinsic signaling molecules. In Drosophila, the BMP family member Dpp is produced in a limited set of imaginal disc cells and functions as a classic morphogen to regulate pattern and growth by diffusing throughout imaginal discs. However, the role of TGFbeta/Activin-like ligands in disc growth control remains ill-defined. Here, we demonstrate that Myoglianin (Myo), an Activin family member, and a close homolog of mammalian Myostatin (Mstn), is a muscle-derived extrinsic factor that uses canonical dSmad2-mediated signaling to regulate wing size. We propose that Myo is a myokine that helps mediate an allometric relationship between muscles and their associated appendages.

32553112	Primary cilia are sensory organelles crucial for cell signaling during development and organ homeostasis. Cilia arise from centrosomes and their formation and function is governed by numerous factors. Through our studies on Townes-Brocks Syndrome (TBS), a rare disease linked to abnormal cilia formation in human fibroblasts, we uncovered the leucine-zipper protein LUZP1 as an interactor of truncated SALL1, a dominantly-acting protein causing the disease. Using TurboID proximity labeling and pulldowns, we show that LUZP1 associates with factors linked to centrosome and actin filaments. Here, we show that LUZP1 is a cilia regulator. It localizes around the centrioles and to actin cytoskeleton. Loss of LUZP1 reduces F-actin levels, facilitates ciliogenesis and alters Sonic Hedgehog signaling, pointing to a key role in cytoskeleton-cilia interdependency. Truncated SALL1 increases the ubiquitin proteasome-mediated degradation of LUZP1. Together with other factors, alterations in LUZP1 may be contributing to TBS etiology.

32553107	The molecular roles of HOX transcriptional activity in human prostate epithelial cells remain unclear, impeding the implementation of new treatment strategies for cancer prevention and therapy. MEIS proteins are transcription factors that bind and direct HOX protein activity. MEIS proteins are putative tumor suppressors that are frequently silenced in aggressive forms of prostate cancer. Here we show that MEIS1 expression is sufficient to decrease proliferation and metastasis of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo murine xenograft models. HOXB13 deletion demonstrates that the tumor-suppressive activity of MEIS1 is dependent on HOXB13. Integration of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data revealed direct and HOXB13-dependent regulation of proteoglycans including decorin (DCN) as a mechanism of MEIS1-driven tumor suppression. These results define and underscore the importance of MEIS1-HOXB13 transcriptional regulation in suppressing prostate cancer progression and provide a mechanistic framework for the investigation of HOXB13 mutants and oncogenic cofactors when MEIS1/2 are silenced.

PIKK family member SMG1 orchestrates progression of an RNA quality control pathway, termed nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), by phosphorylating the NMD factor UPF1. Phosphorylation of UPF1 occurs in its unstructured N- and C-terminal regions at Serine/Threonine-Glutamine (SQ) motifs. How SMG1 and other PIKKs specifically recognize SQ motifs has remained unclear. Here, we present a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction of a human SMG1-8-9 kinase complex bound to a UPF1 phosphorylation site at an overall resolution of 2.9 A. This structure provides the first snapshot of a human PIKK with a substrate-bound active site. Together with biochemical assays, it rationalizes how SMG1 and perhaps other PIKKs specifically phosphorylate Ser/Thr-containing motifs with a glutamine residue at position +1 and a hydrophobic residue at position -1, thus elucidating the molecular basis for phosphorylation site recognition.

32406817	The transcriptional activation and repression during NK cell ontology are poorly understood. Here, using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we reveal a novel role for T-bet in suppressing the immature gene signature during murine NK cell development. Based on transcriptome, we identified five distinct NK cell clusters and define their relative developmental maturity in the bone marrow. Transcriptome-based machine-learning classifiers revealed that half of the mTORC2-deficient NK cells belongs to the least mature NK cluster. Mechanistically, loss of mTORC2 results in an increased expression of signature genes representing immature NK cells. Since mTORC2 regulates the expression of T-bet through Akt(S473)-FoxO1 axis, we further characterized the T-bet-deficient NK cells and found an augmented immature transcriptomic signature. Moreover, deletion of Foxo1 restores the expression of T-bet and corrects the abnormal expression of immature NK genes. Collectively, our study reveals a novel role for mTORC2-Akt(S473)-FoxO1-T-bet axis in suppressing the transcriptional signature of immature NK cells.

32396064	Metabolic pathways and inflammatory processes are under circadian regulation. Rhythmic immune cell recruitment is known to impact infection outcomes, but whether the circadian clock modulates immunometabolism remains unclear. We find that the molecular clock Bmal1 is induced by inflammatory stimulants, including Ifn-gamma/lipopolysaccharide (M1) and tumor-conditioned medium, to maintain mitochondrial metabolism under metabolically stressed conditions in mouse macrophages. Upon M1 stimulation, myeloid-specific Bmal1 knockout (M-BKO) renders macrophages unable to sustain mitochondrial function, enhancing succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-mediated mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species as well as Hif-1alpha-dependent metabolic reprogramming and inflammatory damage. In tumor-associated macrophages, aberrant Hif-1alpha activation and metabolic dysregulation by M-BKO contribute to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Consequently, M-BKO increases melanoma tumor burden, whereas administering the SDH inhibitor dimethyl malonate suppresses tumor growth. Therefore, Bmal1 functions as a metabolic checkpoint that integrates macrophage mitochondrial metabolism, redox homeostasis and effector functions. This Bmal1-Hif-1alpha regulatory loop may provide therapeutic opportunities for inflammatory diseases and immunotherapy.	Bmal1 integrates mitochondrial metabolism and macrophage activation.	eLife	0
32369018	Cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor, also called insulin-like growth factor two receptor (CIM6P/IGF2R), plays important roles in growth and development, but is also extensively expressed in the mature nervous system, particularly in the hippocampus, where its functions are largely unknown. One of its major ligands, IGF2, is critical for long-term memory formation and strengthening. Using CIM6P/IGF2R inhibition in rats and neuron-specific knockdown in mice, here we show that hippocampal CIM6P/IGF2R is necessary for hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation, but dispensable for learning, memory retrieval, and reconsolidation. CIM6P/IGF2R controls the training-induced upregulation of de novo protein synthesis, including increase of Arc, Egr1, and c-Fos proteins, without affecting their mRNA induction. Hippocampal or systemic administration of mannose-6-phosphate, like IGF2, significantly enhances memory retention and persistence in a CIM6P/IGF2R-dependent manner. Thus, hippocampal CIM6P/IGF2R plays a critical role in memory consolidation by controlling the rate of training-regulated protein metabolism and is also a target mechanism for memory enhancement.

33913808	The synaptic connection from medial habenula (MHb) to interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) is critical for emotion-related behaviors and uniquely expresses R-type Ca(2+) channels (Cav2.3) and auxiliary GABAB receptor (GBR) subunits, the K(+)-channel tetramerization domain-containing proteins (KCTDs). Activation of GBRs facilitates or inhibits transmitter release from MHb terminals depending on the IPN subnucleus, but the role of KCTDs is unknown. We therefore examined the localization and function of Cav2.3, GBRs, and KCTDs in this pathway in mice. We show in heterologous cells that KCTD8 and KCTD12b directly bind to Cav2.3 and that KCTD8 potentiates Cav2.3 currents in the absence of GBRs. In the rostral IPN, KCTD8, KCTD12b, and Cav2.3 co-localize at the presynaptic active zone. Genetic deletion indicated a bidirectional modulation of Cav2.3-mediated release by these KCTDs with a compensatory increase of KCTD8 in the active zone in KCTD12b-deficient mice. The interaction of Cav2.3 with KCTDs therefore scales synaptic strength independent of GBR activation.

33764296	Strategies have not been available until recently to uncover interacting protein networks specific to key cell types, their subcellular compartments, and their major regulators during complex in vivo events. Here, we apply BioID2 proximity labeling to capture protein networks acting within cardiomyocytes during a key model of innate heart regeneration in zebrafish. Transgenic zebrafish expressing a promiscuous BirA2 localized to the entire myocardial cell or membrane compartment were generated, each identifying distinct proteomes in adult cardiomyocytes that became altered during regeneration. BioID2 profiling for interactors with ErbB2, a co-receptor for the cardiomyocyte mitogen Nrg1, implicated Rho A as a target of ErbB2 signaling in cardiomyocytes. Blockade of Rho A during heart regeneration, or during cardiogenic stimulation by the mitogenic influences Nrg1, Vegfaa, or vitamin D, disrupted muscle creation. Our findings reveal proximity labeling as a useful resource to interrogate cell proteomes and signaling networks during tissue regeneration in zebrafish.

33755016	SHP2 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that normally potentiates intracellular signaling by growth factors, antigen receptors, and some cytokines, yet is frequently mutated in human cancer. Here, we examine the role of SHP2 in the responses of breast cancer cells to EGF by monitoring phosphoproteome dynamics when SHP2 is allosterically inhibited by SHP099. The dynamics of phosphotyrosine abundance at more than 400 tyrosine residues reveal six distinct response signatures following SHP099 treatment and washout. Remarkably, in addition to newly identified substrate sites on proteins such as occludin, ARHGAP35, and PLCgamma2, another class of sites shows reduced phosphotyrosine abundance upon SHP2 inhibition. Sites of decreased phospho-abundance are enriched on proteins with two nearby phosphotyrosine residues, which can be directly protected from dephosphorylation by the paired SH2 domains of SHP2 itself. These findings highlight the distinct roles of the scaffolding and catalytic activities of SHP2 in effecting a transmembrane signaling response.

33729157	Mutations in the lysine demethylase 5 (KDM5) family of transcriptional regulators are associated with intellectual disability, yet little is known regarding their spatiotemporal requirements or neurodevelopmental contributions. Utilizing the mushroom body (MB), a major learning and memory center within the Drosophila brain, we demonstrate that KDM5 is required within ganglion mother cells and immature neurons for proper axogenesis. Moreover, the mechanism by which KDM5 functions in this context is independent of its canonical histone demethylase activity. Using in vivo transcriptional and binding analyses, we identify a network of genes directly regulated by KDM5 that are critical modulators of neurodevelopment. We find that KDM5 directly regulates the expression of prospero, a transcription factor that we demonstrate is essential for MB morphogenesis. Prospero functions downstream of KDM5 and binds to approximately half of KDM5-regulated genes. Together, our data provide evidence for a KDM5-Prospero transcriptional axis that is essential for proper MB development.

33646120	Caenorhabditis elegans expresses human Werner syndrome protein (WRN) orthologs as two distinct proteins: MUT-7, with a 3'-5' exonuclease domain, and CeWRN-1, with helicase domains. How these domains cooperate remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate the different contributions of MUT-7 and CeWRN-1 to 22G small interfering RNA (siRNA) synthesis and the plasticity of neuronal signaling. MUT-7 acts specifically in the cytoplasm to promote siRNA biogenesis and in the nucleus to associate with CeWRN-1. The import of siRNA by the nuclear Argonaute NRDE-3 promotes the loading of the heterochromatin-binding protein HP1 homolog HPL-2 onto specific loci. This heterochromatin complex represses the gene expression of the guanylyl cyclase ODR-1 to direct olfactory plasticity in C. elegans. Our findings suggest that the exonuclease and helicase domains of human WRN may act in concert to promote RNA-dependent loading into a heterochromatin complex, and the failure of this entire process reduces plasticity in postmitotic neurons.

33616038	The committed step of eukaryotic DNA replication occurs when the pairs of Mcm2-7 replicative helicases that license each replication origin are activated. Helicase activation requires the recruitment of Cdc45 and GINS to Mcm2-7, forming Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS complexes (CMGs). Using single-molecule biochemical assays to monitor CMG formation, we found that Cdc45 and GINS are recruited to loaded Mcm2-7 in two stages. Initially, Cdc45, GINS, and likely additional proteins are recruited to unstructured Mcm2-7 N-terminal tails in a Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK)-dependent manner, forming Cdc45-tail-GINS intermediates (CtGs). DDK phosphorylation of multiple phosphorylation sites on the Mcm2-7 tails modulates the number of CtGs formed per Mcm2-7. In a second, inefficient event, a subset of CtGs transfer their Cdc45 and GINS components to form CMGs. Importantly, higher CtG multiplicity increases the frequency of CMG formation. Our findings reveal the molecular mechanisms sensitizing helicase activation to DDK levels with implications for control of replication origin efficiency and timing.

33595435	The kinase PDK1 is a crucial regulator for immune cell development by connecting PI3K to downstream AKT signaling. However, the roles of PDK1 in CD4(+) T cell differentiation, especially in T follicular helper (Tfh) cell, remain obscure. Here we reported PDK1 intrinsically promotes the Tfh cell differentiation and germinal center responses upon acute infection by using conditional knockout mice. PDK1 deficiency in T cells caused severe defects in both early differentiation and late maintenance of Tfh cells. The expression of key Tfh regulators was remarkably downregulated in PDK1-deficient Tfh cells, including Tcf7, Bcl6, Icos, and Cxcr5. Mechanistically, ablation of PDK1 led to impaired phosphorylation of AKT and defective activation of mTORC1, resulting in substantially reduced expression of Hif1alpha and p-STAT3. Meanwhile, decreased p-AKT also suppresses mTORC2-associated GSK3beta activity in PDK1-deficient Tfh cells. These integrated effects contributed to the dramatical reduced expression of TCF1 and ultimately impaired the Tfh cell differentiation.

33594975	Brain homeostasis is regulated by the viability and functionality of neurons. HAT (histone acetyltransferase) and HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitors have been applied to treat neurological deficits in humans; yet, the epigenetic regulation in neurodegeneration remains elusive. Mutations of HAT cofactor TRRAP (transformation/transcription domain-associated protein) cause human neuropathies, including psychosis, intellectual disability, autism, and epilepsy, with unknown mechanism. Here we show that Trrap deletion in Purkinje neurons results in neurodegeneration of old mice. Integrated transcriptomics, epigenomics, and proteomics reveal that TRRAP via SP1 conducts a conserved transcriptomic program. TRRAP is required for SP1 binding at the promoter proximity of target genes, especially microtubule dynamics. The ectopic expression of Stathmin3/4 ameliorates defects of TRRAP-deficient neurons, indicating that the microtubule dynamics is particularly vulnerable to the action of SP1 activity. This study unravels a network linking three well-known, but up-to-date unconnected, signaling pathways, namely TRRAP, HAT, and SP1 with microtubule dynamics, in neuroprotection.	HAT cofactor TRRAP modulates microtubule dynamics via SP1 signaling to prevent neurodegeneration.	eLife	0
33591274	Chromosome segregation during cell division requires engagement of kinetochores of sister chromatids with microtubules emanating from opposite poles. As the corresponding microtubules shorten, these 'bioriented' sister kinetochores experience tension-dependent stabilization of microtubule attachments. The yeast XMAP215 family member and microtubule polymerase, Stu2, associates with kinetochores and contributes to tension-dependent stabilization in vitro. We show here that a C-terminal segment of Stu2 binds the four-way junction of the Ndc80 complex (Ndc80c) and that residues conserved both in yeast Stu2 orthologs and in their metazoan counterparts make specific contacts with Ndc80 and Spc24. Mutations that perturb this interaction prevent association of Stu2 with kinetochores, impair cell viability, produce biorientation defects, and delay cell cycle progression. Ectopic tethering of the mutant Stu2 species to the Ndc80c junction restores wild-type function in vivo. These findings show that the role of Stu2 in tension-sensing depends on its association with kinetochores by binding with Ndc80c.	Structural basis of Stu2 recruitment to yeast kinetochores.	eLife	0
33555257	The Hippo (Hpo) pathway regulates tissue growth in many animals. Multiple upstream components promote Hpo pathway activity, but the organization of these different inputs, the degree of crosstalk between them, and whether they are regulated in a distinct manner is not well understood. Kibra (Kib) activates the Hpo pathway by recruiting the core Hpo kinase cassette to the apical cortex. Here, we show that the Hpo pathway downregulates Drosophila Kib levels independently of Yorkie-mediated transcription. We find that Hpo signaling complex formation promotes Kib degradation via SCF(Slimb)-mediated ubiquitination, that this effect requires Merlin, Salvador, Hpo, and Warts, and that this mechanism functions independently of other upstream Hpo pathway activators. Moreover, Kib degradation appears patterned by differences in mechanical tension across the wing. We propose that Kib degradation mediated by Hpo pathway components and regulated by cytoskeletal tension serves to control Kib-driven Hpo pathway activation and ensure optimally scaled and patterned tissue growth.	Negative feedback couples Hippo pathway activation with Kibra degradation independent of Yorkie-mediated transcription.	eLife	1
33459596	Germline mutations in the Folliculin (FLCN) tumor suppressor gene cause Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant disorder predisposing carriers to kidney tumors. FLCN is a conserved, essential gene linked to diverse cellular processes but the mechanism by which FLCN prevents kidney cancer remains unknown. Here, we show that disrupting FLCN in human renal tubular epithelial cells (RPTEC/TERT1) activates TFE3, upregulating expression of its E-box targets, including RRAGD and GPNMB, without modifying mTORC1 activity. Surprisingly, the absence of FLCN or its binding partners FNIP1/FNIP2 induces interferon response genes independently of interferon. Mechanistically, FLCN loss promotes STAT2 recruitment to chromatin and slows cellular proliferation. Our integrated analysis identifies STAT1/2 signaling as a novel target of FLCN in renal cells and BHD tumors. STAT1/2 activation appears to counterbalance TFE3-directed hyper-proliferation and may influence immune responses. These findings shed light on unique roles of FLCN in human renal tumorigenesis and pinpoint candidate prognostic biomarkers.

33438577	The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is a critical regulator of melanocyte development and differentiation. It also plays an important role in melanoma where it has been described as a molecular rheostat that, depending on activity levels, allows reversible switching between different cellular states. Here, we show that MITF directly represses the expression of genes associated with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and focal adhesion pathways in human melanoma cells as well as of regulators of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) such as CDH2, thus affecting cell morphology and cell-matrix interactions. Importantly, we show that these effects of MITF are reversible, as expected from the rheostat model. The number of focal adhesion points increased upon MITF knockdown, a feature observed in drug-resistant melanomas. Cells lacking MITF are similar to the cells of minimal residual disease observed in both human and zebrafish melanomas. Our results suggest that MITF plays a critical role as a repressor of gene expression and is actively involved in shaping the microenvironment of melanoma cells in a cell-autonomous manner.

33432928	Skeletal muscle possesses an outstanding capacity to regenerate upon injury due to the adult muscle stem cell (MuSC) activity. This ability requires the proper balance between MuSC expansion and differentiation, which is critical for muscle homeostasis and contributes, if deregulated, to muscle diseases. Here, we functionally characterize a novel chromatin-associated long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), Lnc-Rewind, which is expressed in murine MuSCs and conserved in human. We find that, in mouse, Lnc-Rewind acts as an epigenetic regulator of MuSC proliferation and expansion by influencing the expression of skeletal muscle genes and several components of the WNT (Wingless-INT) signalling pathway. Among them, we identified the nearby Wnt7b gene as a direct Lnc-Rewind target. We show that Lnc-Rewind interacts with the G9a histone lysine methyltransferase and mediates the in cis repression of Wnt7b by H3K9me2 deposition. Overall, these findings provide novel insights into the epigenetic regulation of adult muscle stem cells fate by lncRNAs.

33416496	The oncoprotein transcription factor MYC is a major driver of malignancy and a highly validated but challenging target for the development of anticancer therapies. Novel strategies to inhibit MYC may come from understanding the co-factors it uses to drive pro-tumorigenic gene expression programs, providing their role in MYC activity is understood. Here we interrogate how one MYC co-factor, host cell factor (HCF)-1, contributes to MYC activity in a human Burkitt lymphoma setting. We identify genes connected to mitochondrial function and ribosome biogenesis as direct MYC/HCF-1 targets and demonstrate how modulation of the MYC-HCF-1 interaction influences cell growth, metabolite profiles, global gene expression patterns, and tumor growth in vivo. This work defines HCF-1 as a critical MYC co-factor, places the MYC-HCF-1 interaction in biological context, and highlights HCF-1 as a focal point for development of novel anti-MYC therapies.
