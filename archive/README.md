This directory contains the most important code involved in the model training process, as a reference. 

cleanlab-trial3 -> Identify data in train set that is mislabelled

train_model_kaggle -> Train/fine tune transformer model (Note - model performance very slightly different than that in other code, despite code used to train the model being the same, because full determinism couldn't be achieved)

final-val-test-check -> Check validation, test, and manual test performance of model 

pr-curve -> Plot precision recall curve using transformer model 

Most of the data for this code can be found in the "Data" folder of this repository. This set of code and data is by no means comprehensive, and is intended more for reference than development purposes. For any questions please contact spalayew@gmail.com.
