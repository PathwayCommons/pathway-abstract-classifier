Careful assay revealed only minimal concentrations of IL-1, particularly its biologically active form, in SF. No IL-1 was detectable in the plasma of patients that had IL-1 in their SF. Concentrations of both immunoreactive IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha in SF of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients were significantly higher than those in SF from patients with other inflammatory arthritides or osteoarthritis (OA). IL-6 and sIL-2R concentrations in both SF and plasma were higher in RA patients than in OA patients, and were significantly correlated. Approximately half of the SF from patients with all arthropathies contained detectable IFN-alpha, whilst IFN-Y was present in less than 10%. There were significant associations between IL-6, sIL-2R, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and IFN-alpha. The concentration of these cytokines, where detectable, was also related to leukocyte counts in the SF, as well as to parameters assessing local and systemic disease activity. Although IL-6 was the cytokine most clearly related to other cytokines, and to parameters assessing disease activity, the relationship between general articular disease activity and IL-6 was only evident in patients with arthropathies other than rheumatoid arthritis.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "I", "last_name": "Holt", "initials": "I", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["University of Manchester Rheumatic Diseases Centre, Hope Hospital, Salford."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "R G", "last_name": "Cooper", "initials": "RG", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J", "last_name": "Denton", "initials": "J", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A", "last_name": "Meager", "initials": "A", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S J", "last_name": "Hopkins", "initials": "SJ", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "British journal of rheumatology", "issn": ["0263-7103"], "volume": "31", "issue": "11", "pub_year": "1992", "pub_month": "Nov", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "1309841", "doi": null, "title": "Proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-6, but not IL-1, down-regulate the osteocalcin gene promoter.", "abstract": "A proinflammatory cytokine cascade, including IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8, is activated in response to infection or immunologic insult. Besides their immunologic effects, several of these mediators stimulate bone resorption and inhibit bone formation. Osteocalcin, the most abundant noncollagenous protein present in bone, is an osteoblast-specific product whose production closely correlates with bone formation, and which has also been implicated in control of bone resorption. IL-1 and TNF have previously been shown to down-regulate osteocalcin production in vitro and in vivo, although the mechanism of this inhibition is unknown. In the present studies, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha both inhibited 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-stimulated production of osteocalcin protein and mRNA by ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells, whereas IL-6 had no effect on protein and only weakly inhibited mRNA. To determine if down-regulation was exerted at the transcriptional level, an osteocalcin promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion gene was constructed (PHOC-CAT). After transient transfection of PHOC-CAT into ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells, reporter CAT activity was up-regulated by vitamin D at concentrations above 10(-12) M. In screening studies, TNF-alpha (-57%) and IL-6 (-37%) inhibited vitamin D-stimulated osteocalcin transcription, whereas IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-8 had no effect. Other immune cytokines and growth factors, including IL-2, IL-3, IL-7, and M-CSF, also failed to regulate osteocalcin transcription. Despite their lack of promoter regulation, IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta also stimulated PGE2 production by ROS 17/2.8, further confirming the ability of the host cell to respond to these mediators. In dose-response experiments, down-regulation by TNF-alpha was significant at concentrations as low as 0.14 pM (0.1 U/ml), whereas approximately 10(4)-fold higher concentration of IL-6 was required to exert a similar effect. TNF-alpha-mediated down-regulation was unaffected by indomethacin. These data demonstrate that of these cytokines, TNF-alpha alone potently down-regulates osteocalcin promoter function, whereas IL-1 acts post-transcriptionally, possibly by reducing mRNA stability. Heterogeneity therefore exists among the proinflammatory cytokines with respect to the level at which control of osteocalcin expression is exerted.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "Y P", "last_name": "Li", "initials": "YP", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Immunology, Forsyth Research Institute, Boston, MA 02115."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "P", "last_name": "Stashenko", "initials": "P", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "issn": ["0022-1767"], "volume": "148", "issue": "3", "pub_year": "1992", "pub_month": "Feb", "pub_day": "01"}}, {"pmid": "1311232", "doi": "10.1210/endo.130.3.1311232", "title": "Adrenocorticotropin increases interleukin-6 release from rat adrenal zona glomerulosa cells.", "abstract": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is produced by adrenal zona glomerulosa cells; its release is stimulated by several secretagogues, including IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and angiotensin II. The present study reports that ACTH (0.1-100 nM) increased the release of IL-6 from primary cultures of rat adrenal cells in a concentration-dependent manner. This increase was accompanied by an increase in cAMP content in cell extracts and in the incubation medium. The dynamics of IL-6 release from the adrenal cells also were investigated using a perifusion system; approximately 50 min were required for the effects of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and ACTH on IL-6 release to become apparent. Following withdrawal of the secretagogues, IL-6 release returned to basal levels within 90-120 min. In some experiments, the adrenal zona glomerulosa was separated from the zona fasciculata/reticularis to determine the origin of secretagogue-stimulated IL-6 release. PGE2 and forskolin increased IL-6 release from both cell types, but maximal release from zona glomerulosa cells was more than 10-fold greater than that from zona fasciculata/reticularis cells. ACTH (0.1-100 nM) increased intracellular cAMP levels in cells from both cell types in a concentration-dependent manner, but increased IL-6 release only from zona glomerulosa cells. Dexamethasone, an inhibitor of IL-6 production in several tissues, had no effect on either basal or stimulated IL-6 production in the adrenal. Because IL-1 beta is produced primarily by tissues of the immune system, whereas ACTH is a classical endocrine hormone, we investigated the effect of interaction of these proteins on IL-6 release from the adrenal. Together, IL-1 beta and ACTH stimulation of IL-6 release was greater than the sum of the effects of each substance separately; however, IL-1 beta did not potentiate the effect of ACTH on cAMP levels. Similarly, IL-1 beta potentiated IL-6 release stimulated by forskolin and (Bu)2cAMP. Thus, the adrenal may be an important convergence point between the immune and endocrine systems, and because IL-6 release is regulated by IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, ACTH, and angiotensin II, and this cytokine stimulates corticosterone release, IL-6 may play an important paracrine role in integrating the signals derived from these systems.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "A M", "last_name": "Judd", "initials": "AM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Medicine, University of Virginia Health Sciences Center, Charlottesville 22908."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "R M", "last_name": "MacLeod", "initials": "RM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Endocrinology", "issn": ["0013-7227"], "volume": "130", "issue": "3", "pub_year": "1992", "pub_month": "Mar", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "1312844", "doi": "10.1016/0006-291x(92)90569-7", "title": "Interaction of interferon-alpha with interleukin-1 beta or tumor necrosis factor-alpha on hepatitis B virus enhancer activity.", "abstract": "The interaction of IFN-alpha with IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha on hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) expression was analysed in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA integrated PLC/PRF/5 and non-integrated HuH-7 human hepatoma cells.

The cytokine is secreted by cells of the anterior pituitary and endocrine pancreas and has recently been shown to be produced by cultures of thyroid epithelial cells. In this study we have examined some of the factors which regulate IL-6 release from an immortalized human thyroid line (HTori3). IL-6 release over 24 h was stimulated by TSH (5000 microU/ml), by forskolin (0.01 mmol/l), by fetal calf serum (1-20%) and by epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml). Stimulation was also apparent with gamma-interferon and with tumour necrosis factor at concentrations known to enhance class II major histocompatibility antigen expression by thyroid epithelium. The most potent factor tested was interleukin-1 (IL-1), which controls IL-6 release from other cell types. Threefold stimulation was found with 1 U/ml rising to 350-fold with 1000 U/ml. The effect of IL-1 took 2 h to develop and was blocked by cycloheximide (100 mumol/l). Stimulation was not markedly inhibited by pertussis toxin. Many of the actions of IL-1 are mediated by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). At concentrations as low as 30 nmol/l, PGE2 stimulated IL-6 release but the maximum stimulation obtained with PGE2 was only threefold. The effect of IL-1 was not inhibited by indomethacin. These data provide further evidence that IL-6 is produced by human thyrocytes. The effect of IL-1 has not been demonstrated previously.

Thus, physiological and pharmacological concentrations of hydrocortisone had dramatic inhibitory effects on the supernatant levels of TNF and IL-1, and on the number of available TNF, IL-1 and IL-6 transcripts in PEC exposed to LPS, but had minimal effects on supernatant levels of IL-6 bioactivity.

The addition of IL-4 to cells cultured under basal conditions caused a dose-dependent suppression in the release of 92-kD type IV collagenase without affecting TIMP production. 92-kD enzyme secretion was inhibited by 50% with 1-2 ng/ml of IL-4 and by 90% with 10 ng/ml of IL-4.

Metabolic labeling experiments and Northern hybridizations demonstrated that IL-4 exerted its action at a pretranslational level. Furthermore, IL-4 possessed the capacity to inhibit metalloproteinase expression even in the relatively immature peripheral blood monocyte. As reported previously (Shapiro, S. D., E. J. Campbell, D.

Nanomolar concentrations of LTB4 were optimal and the LTB4 receptor antagonist LY 255283 could block its activity.

Gelatinase B (96 kDa), a matrix metalloproteinase inducible by IL-1 beta, was dose-dependently regulated in the parental C127 cell line and in the weakly transformed cell line Tlc. These data suggest that transformation processes by BPV1 generally impair IL-1-regulated gene transcription. This impairment seems not to be located at the IL-1 beta receptor level, since in all the cell lines studied the numbers and affinities of the IL-1 beta binding sites were found to be comparable. This impairment seems not to be mediated by transformation-induced inactivation of the protein kinase C pathway since phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induced IL-6 production equally well in all C127 cell-derived clones. It is suggested that BPV1 transformation can change the expression of host genes that might play a functional role in tumor immune surveillance and tumorigenicity in vivo.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "A", "last_name": "Fuse", "initials": "A", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Rega Institute for Medical Research, University of Leuven, Belgium."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "B", "last_name": "Simizu", "initials": "B", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Van Ranst", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "G", "last_name": "Opdenakker", "initials": "G", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J", "last_name": "Van Damme", "initials": "J", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Lymphokine and cytokine research", "issn": ["1056-5477"], "volume": "11", "issue": "4", "pub_year": "1992", "pub_month": "Aug", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "1330702", "doi": "10.1016/0014-5793(92)81431-k", "title": "Synthesis of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in human hepatoma cells (HepG2).

Dibutyryl cAMP, 8-Br-cAMP and two adenylate cyclase-activating reagents, cholera toxin (CT) and forskolin (FK), all exhibited the similar augmenting effects as IL-1. These reagents augmented M1 cell differentiation by IL-6, and they did not induce differentiation in combination with IL-1. cAMP derivatives, CT, FK, IL-1 and IL-6 all inhibited the proliferation of M1 cells.

Lipopolysaccharide, which is a known stimulus for interleukin-1 transcription in several cell types, also induced interleukin-1 mRNA accumulation, thus indicating that lipopolysaccharide mediates interleukin-1 gene activation in human mesangial cells through an interleukin-1-independent pathway.

We have previously shown that IL-4 reduces steady state messenger RNA (mRNA) levels for IL-1 beta in human monocytes by decreasing both IL-1 beta transcription and the t1/2 of newly formed IL-1 beta mRNA transcripts. In the present study, we extend these findings to show that IL-4 similarly accelerates the turnover of IL-6 mRNA in LPS-stimulated monocytes. However, this inhibition of cytokine expression and dramatic increase in the decay rate of cytokine mRNA does not extend to all LPS-inducible genes because IL-4 treatment did not inhibit the expression or accelerate the turnover of mRNA for the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) in the same cells. Although IL-1 beta and IL-1Ra are both LPS-inducible genes, they displayed distinct temporal patterns of expression. Peak steady state mRNA levels for IL-1ra lagged significantly behind that of IL-1 beta, suggesting a possible endogenous mechanism for limiting IL-1 biologic activity. Furthermore, although IL-4 suppressed expression of both IL-1 beta and IL-6, it up-regulated synthesis of IL-1ra mRNA and protein.

Because glomerular mesangial cells (MC) secrete M-CSF, we investigated whether cultured MRL-lpr MC secrete more M-CSF than C3H MC. Paradoxically, unstimulated MRL-lpr MC secreted substantially less M-CSF than C3H MC [26 +/- 11 vs. 109 +/- 7 colony forming units (CFU)].

Fewer MRL-lpr MC than C3H MC (24 +/- 5% vs. 78 +/- 5%) expressed membrane M-CSF. Furthermore, the increase in the mean channel log fluorescence intensity on MRL-lpr MC was considerably less than in C3H MC, indicating a lower density of M-CSF on MRL-lpr MC. Because our prior studies established that MRL-lpr kidneys have enhanced expression of TNF alpha, we stimulated cultured MC with TNF alpha. TNF alpha increased M-CSF secretion by stimulated MRL-lpr by twofold over unstimulated MRL-lpr MC, but did not increase M-CSF in C3H MC.

In order to study it, some combinations of expression vectors NF-IL6 cDNA, NF-kappa B (p50/p65) cDNA and reporter plasmid K18-CAT which contains human IL-6 promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, were transfected into Jurkat cells and the CAT activities were examined.

Then, co-transfection of NF-IL6 and NF-kappa B subunit p65 alone showed a high level of CAT activity, too. When 5' deletion mutant reporter plasmid K9-CAT lacking the NF-IL6 binding site was used, co-transfection of NF-IL6 and NF-kappa B (p50/p65) showed low level of CAT activity. These results indicate that there is a synergistic effect between NF-IL6 and NF-kappa B (p50/p65) in IL-6 gene regulation. Among two subunits of NF-kappa B (p50/p65), p65 seems to play an important role rather than p50 does in synergism between NF-IL6 and NF-kappa B.

In initial mixing experiments HIV AM supernatants enhanced mitogen-induced T cell proliferation using normal AM as AC significantly more than normal AM supernatants, suggesting that HIV AM secreted more T cell stimulatory factors than normal AM. Neither group could enhance T cell proliferation induced by HIV AM suggesting these cells already secreted optimal levels of these factors. AM from HIV+ individuals produced and secreted more IL-1 beta (measured by ELISA) and IL-6 (measured in a B9 bioassay and by immunoprecipitation) than normal AM both spontaneously and in the presence of low LPS concentrations and mitogens. In some cases depleting HIV AM supernatants of IL-1 beta and IL-6 on immunoaffinity columns abrogated their enhancement properties indicating that these cytokines were important in the observed enhancement.

Actinomycin D chase experiments suggested that enhanced stability of preproendothelin-1 mRNA could not account for the increase in ET-1 transcript levels. TNF-alpha increased ET-1 release and preproendothelin-1 mRNA content in bovine renal artery and bovine glomerular capillary endothelial cells, demonstrating that the TNF-alpha effect was evident in endothelial cells derived from a variety of sources. Furthermore, augmented ET-1 expression in response to TNF-alpha was evident in bovine glomerular mesangial cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "P A", "last_name": "Marsden", "initials": "PA", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Medicine, St. Michael's Hospital, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "B M", "last_name": "Brenner", "initials": "BM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "The American journal of physiology", "issn": ["0002-9513"], "volume": "262", "issue": "4 Pt 1", "pub_year": "1992", "pub_month": "Apr", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "1576016", "doi": "10.1016/8756-3282(92)90010-t", "title": "Effect of calcitriol on the secretion of prostaglandin E2, interleukin 1, and tumor necrosis factor alpha by human monocytes.", "abstract": "Cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage express specific receptors for calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) and secrete prostaglandins and several cytokines with potent effects on bone metabolism. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of calcitriol on the secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF alpha). Monocyte-enriched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy subjects were cultured in the presence or absence of calcitriol (10(-11)-10(-7) M) and several stimulating agents. After 24 h, PGE2, IL-1, and TNF alpha were measured in the culture supernatants or lysates with specific immunoassays. Calcitriol induced a biphasic effect on PGE2 production by unstimulated cells and increased PGE2 synthesis by cells stimulated with either endotoxin or tau-interferon (IFN-tau). On the other hand, calcitriol inhibited the production of TNF alpha by monocytes stimulated with either IFN-tau or phorbol esters. This effect was not prevented by the addition of indomethacin, IL-1, or IL-2. Under the conditions used, we observed no effect of calcitriol on IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta production. These results indicate that calcitriol induces in vitro marked changes in the secretion of monocyte products with known activity on bone cells.

By using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we found that approximately 2 to 10 ng/ml of IL-6 was secreted by cultured H-RS cells (10(6) cells/ml). In tissues, we were able to immunolocalize IL-6 in the cytoplasm in 10 to 30% of H-RS cells by using rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal anti-IL-6 antibodies. There was no correlation among the IL-6 staining intensity, number of H-RS cells stained, and the degree of plasma cell infiltration. However, in 3 of 17 cases studied, a large number (60%) of H-RS cells were positive for IL-6, and in these patients, abundant plasma cells were present. In one patient, the involved lymph node also showed histologic features similar to those of Castleman's disease. In this patient, we noted abundant IL-6 expression not only in H-RS cells, but also in most reactive histiocytes.

We also conducted studies with specific anti-IL-4 antibodies, which did not show IL-4 production by H-RS cells in both cultures and tissues. In tissues, only rare IL-4 positive lymphoid cells or dendritic cells were identified.

The rate of release of PGs [PGE2, PGF2 alpha, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (6KPGF1 alpha) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) in the medium was found to stabilize after 60 min of preincubation and thereafter remain constant, with TXB2 being the predominant species. Twenty-minute incubation in the presence of human recombinant IL-1 beta or IL-6, in the dose range 1-100 U/ml, had no effect on the release of PGF2 alpha, 6KPGF1 alpha or TXB2; however, the release of PGE2 was significantly increased by both IL-1 beta and IL-6. The effect of IL-1 beta was antagonized by both indomethacin and dexamethasone. None of the other neurotransmitters tested had any effect on the release of any of the PGs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "P", "last_name": "Navarra", "initials": "P", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Pharmacology, Catholic University Medical School, Rome, Italy."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "G", "last_name": "Pozzoli", "initials": "G", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "L", "last_name": "Brunetti", "initials": "L", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "E", "last_name": "Ragazzoni", "initials": "E", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Besser", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A", "last_name": "Grossman", "initials": "A", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Neuroendocrinology", "issn": ["0028-3835"], "volume": "56", "issue": "1", "pub_year": "1992", "pub_month": "Jul", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "1648713", "doi": "10.1016/0196-9781(91)90015-h", "title": "Neuropeptide alpha-MSH antagonizes IL-6- and TNF-induced fever.", "abstract": "The pro-opiomelanocortin-derived peptide melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) antagonizes the fever induced by several stimuli including endotoxin, endogenous pyrogen, and certain cytokines.

The possibility that wild-type (wt) p53, a nuclear tumor-suppressor protein, but not its transforming mutants might serve to repress IL-6 gene expression was investigated in HeLa cells. We transiently cotransfected these cells with constitutive cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer/promoter expression plasmids overproducing wt or mutant human or murine p53 and with appropriate chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmids containing the promoter elements of human IL-6, c-fos, or beta-actin genes or of porcine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene in pN-38 to evaluate the effect of the various p53 species on these promoters. Murine and human wt p53 derived from pCMVNc9 and pC53-SN3, respectively, strongly repressed the IL-6 (promoter position -225 to +13), c-fos (-711 to +42), beta-actin (-3400 to +912), and MHC (-528 to -38) promoters in serum-induced HeLa cells; additionally, IL-6 promoter/CAT transcription unit constructs induced by IL-1, phorbol ester, or pseudorabies virus were also repressed by wt human and murine p53.

We were interested in whether other hypothalamic neuropeptides, which activate adenylate cyclase in the pituitary, also stimulate pituitary IL-6 production. Whereas vasoactive intestinal peptide was effective in stimulating pituitary IL-6 production only at concentrations of 10(-6) M or higher, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide with 38 residues (PACAP38) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) at concentrations from 10(-10) to 10(-9) M significantly stimulated IL-6 production. Similar effective concentrations of each peptide were required for activating adenylate cyclase, as measured by extracellular cAMP accumulation. H89, a specific inhibitor of cAMP dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A), inhibited IL-6 production stimulated by PACAP38, CGRP, and (Bu)2cAMP. However, H89 failed to inhibit the IL-6 production stimulated by lipopolysaccharide, a ligand which enhanced IL-6 production in the absence of cAMP accumulation. Two other peptides which are known to activate pituitary adenylate cyclase, corticotropin-releasing factor and GRF failed to stimulate IL-6 production in pituitary cells. Using discontinuous Percoll gradients to fractionate the pituitary cells, the greatest PACAP38-stimulated IL-6 secretion was observed in the low density fraction 1 (F1). This fraction also contained the highest percentage of folliculo-stellate (FS) cells, one of the nonhormone secreting pituitary cells. However, the largest PACAP38-induced accumulation of cAMP was observed in F4. These results suggest that the production of IL-6 stimulated by PACAP and CGRP is mediated by the adenylate cyclase/protein kinase A signal transduction system.

In the present study, we have examined whether the TNF-alpha-induced synthesis of IL-6 or collagenase in HOME cells is mediated by an inducible growth factor. Among several growth factors examined, we found that the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) mRNA was the one most prominently enhanced when HOME cells were treated with TNF-alpha. The increase of bFGF mRNA by TNF-alpha in HOME cells was observed in both a dose- and time-dependent manner when assayed by Northern blot analysis. The induction of bFGF mRNA was observed by 3 h after incubation with TNF-alpha, and the maximal increase of 5-fold was obtained after 12 h of incubation with 100 units/ml TNF-alpha. Western blot analysis confirmed the enhanced synthesis of bFGF by TNF-alpha. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation assays of bFGF showed that exposure to TNF-alpha enhanced secretion of bFGF into culture medium and also that TNF-alpha stimulated the production of bFGF molecules with molecular masses of 18, 21, and 22.5 kDa in HOME cells. TNF-alpha induced the expression of collagenase mRNA and IL-6 mRNA in HOME cells as well, and the coadministration of neutralizing anti-bFGF antibody almost completely blocked the effects of TNF-alpha. The treatment of HOME cells with exogenous bFGF significantly stimulated the expression of collagenase mRNA and IL-6 mRNA in HOME cells.

One major pathway by which TNF receptors communicate signals from the membrane to the cell nucleus involves protein kinase C (PKC). In the present study, we have addressed the molecular mechanism of TNF-induced PKC activation. To this, membrane lipids of the human histiocytic cell line U937 were labeled by incubation with various radioactive precursors, and TNF-induced changes in phospholipid, neutral lipid, and water-soluble metabolites were analyzed by thin layer chromatography. TNF treatment of U937 cells resulted in a rapid and transient increase of 1'2'diacylglycerol (DAG), a well-known activator of PKC. The increase in DAG was detectable as early as 15 s after TNF treatment and peaked at 60 s. DAG increments were most pronounced (approximately 360% of basal levels) when cells were preincubated with [14C]lysophosphatidylcholine, which was predominantly incorporated into the phosphatidylcholine (PC) pool of the plasma-membranes. Further extensive examination of changes in metabolically labeled phospholipids indicated that TNF-stimulated hydrolysis of PC is accompanied by the generation of phosphorylcholine and DAG. These results suggest the operation of a PC-specific phospholipase C. Since no changes in phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline were observed and the production of DAG by TNF could not be blocked by either propranolol or ethanol, a combined activation of phospholipase D and PA-phosphohydrolase in DAG production appears unlikely. TNF-stimulated DAG production as well as PKC activation could be blocked by the phospholipase inhibitor p-bromophenacylbromide (BPB). Since BPB did not inactivate PKC directly, these findings underscore that TNF activates PKC via formation of DAG. TNF stimulation of DAG production could be inhibited by preincubation of cells with a monoclonal anti-TNF receptor (p55-60) antibody, indicating that activation of a PC-specific phospholipase C is a TNF receptor-mediated event.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "S", "last_name": "Sch\u00fctze", "initials": "S", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Institut f\u00fcr Medizinische Mikrobiologie und Hygiene, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "D", "last_name": "Berkovic", "initials": "D", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "O", "last_name": "Tomsing", "initials": "O", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "C", "last_name": "Unger", "initials": "C", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Kr\u00f6nke", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "The Journal of experimental medicine", "issn": ["0022-1007"], "volume": "174", "issue": "5", "pub_year": "1991", "pub_month": "Nov", "pub_day": "01"}}, {"pmid": "1659519", "doi": "10.1210/endo-129-6-2933", "title": "Tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibits gonadotropin action in cultured porcine Leydig cells: site(s) of action.", "abstract": "In the present study, we have tested the direct effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on basal and human (h)CG-stimulated testosterone secretion by cultured purified Leydig cells isolated from immature porcine testes. TNF-alpha reduced (as much as 90% decrease) hCG-stimulated, but not basal testosterone secretion in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The maximal and half-maximal effects were, respectively, 3.75 ng/ml (2.2 x 10(-10) M) and 0.66 ng/ml (3.9 x 10(-11) M) of TNF-alpha after 48 h treatment. TNF-alpha antagonizes the gonadotropin hormonal action by affecting at least two types of biochemical steps. First, TNF-alpha reduced LH/hCG binding to a maximal decrease of 45% obtained with 2 ng/ml of TNF-alpha after 48 h of treatment. TNF-alpha also inhibited (44% decrease) hCG-stimulated cAMP production in optimal conditions (20 ng/ml, 72 h). Second, TNF-alpha significantly (P less than 0.001) reduced testosterone secretion stimulated with 8-bromo-cAMP (3 x 10(-3) M) in a similar range (86% decrease) to that observed with the gonadotropin. Such an observation indicates that the antigonadotropic action of the cytokine is exerted in a predominant manner at a step(s) located beyond cAMP formation. Furthermore, incubation of Leydig cells with 22R-hydroxycholesterol (5 micrograms/ml, 2 h) reversed most of the inhibitory effect of TNF-alpha on androgen production. Indeed, the TNF-alpha (20 ng/ml, 72 h) inhibitory effect on testosterone production was limited to about 20% (P less than 0.03) in Leydig cells supplied with 22R-hydroxycholesterol. Such a moderate effect of the cytokine in the presence of 22R-hydroxycholesterol compared with that observed when androgen secretion was stimulated with the gonadotropin (up to 90% inhibition) indicate that TNF-alpha acts by dramatically reducing cholesterol substrate availability in the mitochondria. Such an effect of TNF-alpha is directly exerted on Leydig cells since TNF-alpha receptors (dissociation constant approximately 5.4 x 10(-10) M) are present in primary cultures of purified porcine Leydig cells. Together, the present findings show that in Leydig cells TNF-alpha antagonizes the gonadotropin action on testosterone formation predominantly through a decrease in the availability of cholesterol substrate in the mitochondria.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "C", "last_name": "Mauduit", "initials": "C", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["INSERM CJF No. 90-08, Groupe de Recherches sur les Communications Cellulaires, H\u00f4pital Sainte Eug\u00e9nie, Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Pierre-B\u00e9nite, France."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "D J", "last_name": "Hartmann", "initials": "DJ", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M A", "last_name": "Chauvin", "initials": "MA", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A", "last_name": "Revol", "initials": "A", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A M", "last_name": "Morera", "initials": "AM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Benahmed", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Endocrinology", "issn": ["0013-7227"], "volume": "129", "issue": "6", "pub_year": "1991", "pub_month": "Dec", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "1663147", "doi": "10.1007/BF01133023", "title": "Effects of sex steroids on immunoglobulin M production by Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell line SKW6-CL4.", "abstract": "The effects of estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), and testosterone (T) on the production of immunoglobulin (Ig) M by Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell line, SKW6-CL4, were investigated.

In this study we have investigated the ability of PMN to secrete interleukin-6 (IL-6), a molecule known to be involved in inflammatory reactions.

Northern blot analysis with total cellular RNA from mixed populations of PBMC revealed that genes coding for TNF and LT were not spontaneously expressed. Treatment of PBMC with recombinant interleukin (IL)-2 resulted in a high level expression of TNF and LT mRNA. Whereas IL-1 beta was equally effective as IL-2 in inducing both TNF and LT mRNA, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor selectively induced only TNF mRNA. Both TNF and LT mRNA were minimally induced by IL-1 alpha, IL-3, interferon (IFN)-alpha, or IFN-gamma. Similarly TNF alone had little effect on induction of TNF and LT mRNA. In conjunction with IL-2, cytokines such as IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, or TNF did not interfere with IL-2 induction of TNF and LT mRNA. Interestingly, IL-4 in combination with IL-2 inhibited the IL-2-driven induction of TNF and LT mRNA. This inhibitory effect of IL-4 was also observed at the level of TNF and LT protein secretion. Furthermore, IL-4 was also inhibitory of IL-2-mediated induction of Tac mRNA in PBMC. These results extend the interrelationship of cytokine regulation of TNF and LT expression.

Monoclonal antibodies to CR2 immunoprecipitated from digitonin lysates of Raji B lymphoblastoid cells a membrane complex containing CR2, approximately equimolar amounts of CD19, which is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and three unidentified components: p130, p50, and p20. The complex, which was immunoprecipitated also with anti-CD19, could be dissociated by Nonidet P-40, accounting for its absence in previous studies of CR2. Expression of recombinant CR2 and CD19 in K562 erythroleukemia cells led to formation of a complex that contained not only these two proteins but also p130, p50, and p20, and another component, p14. These unidentified components of the CR2/CD19 complex coimmunoprecipitated with CD19 and not with CR2 from singly transfected cells, indicating primary association with the former. CD19 replicated the capacity of CR2 to interact synergistically with mIgM for increasing free intracellular Ca2+, suggesting that the complex mediates this function of CR2. Therefore, CR2 associates directly with CD19 to become a ligand-binding subunit of a pre-existing signal transduction complex of the B cell that may be representative of a family of membrane protein complexes.

This was followed by the highly selective induction of two primary response genes, junB/AP-1 transcription factor and TIS11. junB and TIS11 inductions were unaffected by cycloheximide, suggesting that posttranslational modifications accounted for their activation. Activation of junB and TIS11 transcription required rapid tyrosine kinase activity as well as a different protein kinase activity sensitive to the potent kinase inhibitor, H7, and activated following p160 tyrosine phosphorylation.

To explain the mechanisms for this difference, we compared the regulation of these two genes in human T lymphocytes, isolated from peripheral blood, after stimulation with the mitogens concanavalin A and phorbol myristate acetate. Differences in the kinetics of protein secretion were paralleled by differences in cognate mRNA accumulation. TNF mRNA accumulated rapidly after stimulation, peaked by 6 h, and returned to unstimulated (base-line) levels by 24 h. In contrast, LT mRNA accumulated slowly after stimulation, usually peaked at approximately 18 h, and remained increased above base-line levels at 48-72 h. By nuclear transcription run-on assays, increased transcription of TNF mRNA and LT mRNA was demonstrated after stimulation. However, TNF transcription peaked earlier and appeared to be 4-10 times greater than that of the LT gene. In contrast, the half-life of LT mRNA was 8-10-fold longer than that of TNF mRNA as demonstrated by actinomycin D pulse-chase experiments. Cycloheximide did not block LT or TNF mRNA accumulation, indicating that new protein synthesis was not required for induction of either gene. These results suggest strongly that the LT and TNF genes are regulated differently in human T lymphocytes after mitogen stimulation. TNF mRNA accumulates rapidly primarily because of increased transcription and decreases rapidly related to its brief half-life. In contrast, LT mRNA accumulates more slowly but persists much longer; the accumulation of this mRNA appears to be controlled largely by post-transcriptional mechanisms.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "B K", "last_name": "English", "initials": "BK", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seatle."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "W M", "last_name": "Weaver", "initials": "WM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "C B", "last_name": "Wilson", "initials": "CB", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "issn": ["0021-9258"], "volume": "266", "issue": "11", "pub_year": "1991", "pub_month": "Apr", "pub_day": "15"}}, {"pmid": "1707930", "doi": null, "title": "Effects of cytokine combinations on acute phase protein production in two human hepatoma cell lines.", "abstract": "We evaluated the effects of binary combinations of four cytokines on production of the positive acute phase proteins alpha-1 antichymotrypsin, haptoglobin and fibrinogen, and the negative acute phase proteins albumin and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in two human hepatoma cell lines. The effects of the cytokine combinations on the five proteins varied; each protein exhibited a unique and specific pattern of response to the cytokine combinations. In Hep G2 cells, antichymotrypsin was induced by all four cytokines, IL-6, IL-1, TNF-alpha, and transforming growth factor beta 1 alone, and their effects in binary combinations could be attributed to additive or minimally synergistic interactions. Fibrinogen was induced only by IL-6 and this induction was inhibited by IL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha or transforming growth factor beta 1. Haptoglobin was also induced only by IL-6, but TNF-alpha was the only cytokine that inhibited this induction at all concentrations of IL-6. Each of the four cytokines alone down regulated production of AFP and albumin. However, binary combinations of the four cytokines were simply additive, for the most part, in inhibiting AFP production, whereas the inhibitory effects of combinations of cytokines on albumin production differed significantly from simple additive effects. These observations, taken together with studies of effects of cytokine combinations on other acute phase proteins, indicate that the various acute phase proteins respond differently to different combinations of cytokines and that the potential exists for highly specific regulation of synthesis of individual plasma proteins by cytokine interactions.

In serum free medium, unstimulated human osteoblast-like cells produced IL-6 in the range of 1000-2050 pg/ml/24 h. Recombinant human interleukin 1 (IL-1 alpha) (10(-13)-10(-11) M), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) (10(-9)-10(-7) M) and lipopolysaccharide (5-500 ng/ml) all stimulated release of IL-6 from human bone cells. Maximal levels of 17,000 pg/ml were observed using the highest concentration of IL-1. 1,25(OH)2D3 and PTH did not stimulate IL-6 release. Using a specific sheep antihuman IL-6 antibody, all IL-6 activity could be neutralized. In parallel studies, ROS 17/2.8 rat osteosarcoma cells released around 50 pg/ml of IL-6 under basal conditions which were increased to a maximum of 900 pg/ml by treatment with PTH (10(-9) M). The cytokines were less effective and 1,25(OH)2D3 again had no effect. Modulation of expression of IL-6 mRNA in human osteoblast cells was examined using a human complementary deoxyribonucleic acid probe.

Dexamethasone (10(-6) M) suppressed both basal and IL-1- and TNF-induced IL-6 mRNA expression. IL-6 receptor mRNA was constitutively expressed but was not regulated by any of the above agents.

We applied a McCoy cell culture system to study the effects of various concentrations of beta-estradiol (10(-6) to 10(-10) M) on T. vaginalis growth and CDF production. T. vaginalis growth was unaffected by the different concentrations of beta-estradiol studied, in comparison with the growth of control cultures without beta-estradiol.

The decrease in thrombomodulin mRNA resulted from inhibition of transcription, followed by rapid degradation of thrombomodulin transcripts (t1/2 less than or equal to 3 hours). In pulse-chase incubations, thrombomodulin synthesis decreased parallel with mRNA, but the rate of degradation of radiolabeled thrombomodulin was not significantly altered by TNF. Human thrombomodulin was degraded with a t1/2 of 8.2 +/- 2.4 hours (SD) or 7.5 +/- 1.3 hours (SD) in the absence or presence of TNF, respectively. We conclude that TNF acts primarily to inhibit thrombomodulin transcription. The subsequent decrease in activity results from the inherent instability of thrombomodulin mRNA and protein in these cells, and not from the regulation of thrombomodulin degradation.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "S R", "last_name": "Lentz", "initials": "SR", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Medicine, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Tsiang", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J E", "last_name": "Sadler", "initials": "JE", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Blood", "issn": ["0006-4971"], "volume": "77", "issue": "3", "pub_year": "1991", "pub_month": "Feb", "pub_day": "01"}}, {"pmid": "1847853", "doi": "10.1210/endo-128-3-1223", "title": "Involvement of protein kinase C in regulating tumor necrosis factor alpha-stimulated progesterone production in rat preovulatory follicles in vitro.", "abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) increased progesterone production in preovulatory rat follicles in vitro.

A subset of BM cells has been described which is capable of high-rate Ig secretion for 14 days in vitro without additional stimuli. Therefore, it provides a suitable model for analyzing the terminal B cell differentiation within the BM. The pleiotropic cytokine interleukin (IL)6 was found to be essential for the further maturation of BM spontaneous Ig-secreting cells, as can be deduced from the following findings: (a) the addition of anti-IL-6 antibodies inhibited most of their Ig production; (b) when endogenous IL6 synthesis in the culture was restricted by using serum-free medium, the missing IgG secretion could be restored by the addition of exogenous IL6; and (c) active IL6 synthesis by BM cells in fetal calf serum-containing cultures was confirmed by direct quantitation (range 0.37-2.1 ng/ml). The presence of IL6 during the first 3 days of culture was necessary for the induction of Ig secretion. Since neither the proliferation of these cells was elicited by IL6 nor the inhibition of the DNA synthesis in these cultures prevented the IL6-mediated Ig secretion, IL6 must act on the BM Ig-secreting cells as a differentiation factor. The source of the endogenous IL6 was, apparently, an adherent cell, since most of the IL6 production was present in this cell fraction. In contrast, the nonadherent BM cell fraction contained all of the mature Ig-secreting cells even though it produced little, if any, IL6; the combination of both populations completely restored Ig secretion. Finally, homogeneous populations of fibroblastic stromal cell derived from long-term BM cultures were totally efficient in inducing Ig secretion by purified BM CD38+ cells; this phenomenon was also demonstrated to be IL6 mediated. Taken together, these findings appear to indicate that BM Ig-secreting cells are not terminally differentiated, suggesting that their final maturation could be mediated by the BM microenvironment via the paracrine production of IL6.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "E", "last_name": "Rold\u00e1n", "initials": "E", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Ram\u00f3n y Cajal, Madrid, Spain."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J A", "last_name": "Brieva", "initials": "JA", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "European journal of immunology", "issn": ["0014-2980"], "volume": "21", "issue": "11", "pub_year": "1991", "pub_month": "Nov", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "1937748", "doi": "10.1128/iai.59.11.3889-3894.1991", "title": "Single-dose tumor necrosis factor protection against endotoxin-induced shock and tissue injury in rats.", "abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a macrophage product released in response to endotoxin and other stimuli, has been shown to be a central mediator of endotoxin or septic shock.

Together, IL-1 and IL-6 additively and, to a small degree, synergistically promote the proliferation of highly purified human peripheral blood T cells with phytohemagglutinin (PHA).

Based on these results, the ability of IL-6 to stimulate hematopoietic regeneration following radiation-induced hematopoietic injury was also evaluated. C3H/HeN female mice were exposed to 6.5 Gy 60Co radiation and subcutaneously administered either saline or IL-6 (1,000 micrograms/kg) on days 1 through 3 or 1 through 6 postexposure.

We purified and cultured human fetal Kupffer cells to investigate the production of the cytokine, IL-6. Fetal Kupffer cells treated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) produced IL-6 in a dose-dependent fashion with maximal secretion (1000 pg per 10(6) cells) observed within 12 h using 10 micrograms of LPS/ml. Cortisol and dexamethasone, but not oestrogen, progesterone, or testosterone, dramatically suppressed the LPS-stimulated secretion of IL-6 by fetal Kupffer cells.

The inhibition of glucocorticoids could be reversed by the addition of RU 486, indicating that this effect was mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor.

The increase in the osteopontin mRNA expression by IL-1 alpha was dose-dependent at a range of 0.004-0.2 nM.

Besides IL-1 alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1 alpha,25(OH)2D3) increased the osteopontin mRNA expression in both the clonal osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1) and the primary osteoblast-like cells.

Human articular chondrocytes isolated from normal and osteoarthritic joints released low levels of IL-6 when cultured in the presence of serum.

Analysis of hormonal influences on chondrocyte IL-6 production showed that testosterone and estradiol synergized with IL-1 in the induction of IL-6. Hydrocortisone, at 10 ng/ml, reduced IL-1-induced IL-6 production by more than 50%. Chondrocyte-derived IL-6 stimulated acute phase protein synthesis and hybridoma cell proliferation.

These results demonstrate that chondrocytes are able to produce IL-6 in response to physiologic and inflammatory stimuli.

L. major-specific T cells were isolated from infected BALB/c and B10.D2 mice, and the cells were restimulated in vitro on syngenic or congenic antigen-presenting cells. BALB/c L. major-reactive T cells restimulated with either antigen-presenting cell produced high levels of interleukin-4 and low levels of gamma interferon. In contrast, T cells from B10.D2 mice produced gamma interferon. Radiation-induced chimeras reconstituted with BALB/c bone marrow also produced more interleukin-4 in response to L. major than did chimeras reconstituted with B10.D2 bone marrow. To test whether this pattern of cytokine secretion was unique to infection with L. major, we infected the mice with a second intracellular pathogen, Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Mycobacterium-specific T cells from both BALB/c and B10.D2 mice produced interleukin-2 and no interleukin-4. Finally, when BALB/c mice were vaccinated with avirulent L. major, the induced resistance correlated with reduced production of interleukin-4 but no increase in gamma interferon production. Instead, T cells from the vaccinated mice produced high levels of tumor necrosis factor.

In the present study we examined the role of both constitutively expressed monocyte Fc gamma R, the 72-kDa high affinity Fc gamma R (Fc gamma RI), and the 40-kDa low affinity receptor (Fc gamma RII), in the induction of TNF secretion. On the basis of preferential binding of the Fc moiety of murine mAb of different isotype, Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RII were selectively cross-linked by using either solid-phase murine (m)IgG2a, or solid-phase mIgG1, respectively. On freshly isolated, untreated monocytes only cross-linking of Fc gamma RI with solid-phase mIgG2a induced TNF secretion. The interaction between Fc gamma RII and mIgG1 could be enhanced by treatment of monocytes with proteases or with the desialylating enzyme neuraminidase. After treatment of monocytes with these enzymes, TNF secretion was effectively induced by solid-phase mIgG1, apparently through cross-linking of Fc gamma RII.

In contrast, there was no detectable effect of LPS on activation of protein kinase C. We also demonstrate that inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity with bromophenacyl bromide or quinacrine blocks the induction of TNF transcripts by LPS. These findings suggested that LPS induces TNF gene expression through formation of arachidonic acid metabolites. Indeed, similar results were obtained with mellitin, a known activator of phospholipase A2 and eicosanoid production. Previous studies have also suggested that TNF mRNA levels are increased in HL-60 cells by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway and, in the present work inhibitors of this enzyme blocked LPS-induced TNF expression. Moreover, the cyclooxygenase metabolite, PGE2, as well as dibutyryl cAMP, inhibited the induction of TNF transcripts by LPS.

LMP1 is known to be an oncogene in rodent fibroblasts and to induce B-lymphocyte activation and cellular adhesion molecules in the EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Louckes. EBNA-2 is required for EBV-induced growth transformation; it lowers rodent fibroblast serum dependence and specifically induces the B-lymphocyte activation antigen CD23 in Louckes cells. These initial observations are now extended through an expanded study of EBNA- and LMP1-induced phenotypic effects in a different EBV-negative B-lymphoma cell line, BJAB. LMP1 effects were also evaluated in the EBV-negative B-lymphoma cell line BL41 and the EBV-positive Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, Daudi (Daudi is deleted for EBNA-2 and does not express LMP). Previously described EBNA-2- and LMP1-transfected Louckes cells were studied in parallel. EBNA-2, from EBV-1 strains but not EBV-2, induced CD23 and CD21 expression in transfected BJAB cells. In contrast, EBNA-3C induced CD21 but not CD23, while no changes were evident in vector control-, EBNA-1-, or EBNA-LP-transfected clones. EBNAs did not affect CD10, CD30, CD39, CD40, CD44, or cellular adhesion molecules. LMP1 expression in all cell lines induced growth in large clumps and expression of the cellular adhesion molecules ICAM-1, LFA-1, and LFA-3 in those cell lines which constitutively express low levels. LMP1 expression induced marked homotypic adhesion in the BJAB cell line, despite the fact that there was no significant increase in the high constitutive BJAB LFA-1 and ICAM-1 levels, suggesting that LMP1 also induces an associated functional change in these molecules. LMP1 induction of these cellular adhesion molecules was also associated with increased heterotypic adhesion to T lymphocytes. The Burkitt's lymphoma marker, CALLA (CD10), was uniformly down regulated by LMP1 in all cell lines. In contrast, LMP1 induced unique profiles of B-lymphocyte activation antigens in the various cell lines. LMP1 induced CD23 and CD39 in BJAB; CD23 in Louckes; CD39 and CD40 in BL41; and CD21, CD40, and CD44 in Daudi. In BJAB, CD23 surface and mRNA expression were markedly increased by EBNA-2 and LMP1 coexpression, compared with EBNA-2 or LMP1 alone.

Inasmuch as IL-1 and TNF have been shown to be important priming agents, as well as agents that induce migration of PMN, we investigated their effect on IL-1 beta gene expression in human peripheral blood PMN. In the present study, we demonstrate that human peripheral blood PMN produce IL-1 beta in response to IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha. Control (unstimulated) human PMN had virtually undetectable levels of IL-1 beta mRNA. Either IL-1 beta or TNF, induced PMN to transiently express IL-1 beta mRNA with peak expression at 1 h, returning to untreated levels by 2 h. A dose response indicated that as little as 0.05 ng/ml of IL-1 beta or TNF resulted in IL-1 beta induction, with maximal effects at 1 ng/ml of IL-1 beta and 5 ng/ml of TNF. IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta exhibited similar dose responses in IL-1 beta mRNA induction. Inasmuch as cytokines have been shown to have synergistic effects in cell function studies, we induced PMN with a combination of maximally effective doses of TNF plus IL-1 beta. They demonstrated a cooperative effect on IL-1 beta gene expression, in that mRNA levels were sustained for three hours. IL-1 beta Ag expression, as measured by ELISA, paralleled IL-1 beta mRNA expression with cell associated peak levels at 2 to 4 h. IL-1 beta Ag levels in PMN lysates and supernatants correlated with IL-1 beta mRNA levels, i.e., TNF + IL-1 greater than TNF greater than IL-1. Thus, these studies represent the first demonstration of IL-1 and TNF induction of IL-1 beta gene expression in the PMN.

Since the bone resorbing cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/cachectin is associated with cachexia and hypertriglyceridemia, we examined hypercalcemic tumor-bearing rats for evidence of increased TNF production using a TNF radioimmunoassay. We found that immunoreactive TNF was increased in the plasma of tumor-bearing rats. The increase in plasma TNF was comparable to that previously shown in hypercalcemic nude mice bearing Chinese hamster ovarian cell tumors transfected with the human TNF gene. There was no detectable TNF activity in tumor culture media which suggested that the tumor itself was not the source of excess TNF production. However, we found that tumor cell conditioned media enhanced the production of TNF activity by normal macrophages in vitro, indicating that increased TNF production in vivo may result from a tumor factor(s) which stimulates TNF production by normal immune cells. When TNF was added together with tumor products to organ cultures of fetal rat long bones, osteoclastic bone resorption was potentiated.

The mechanism of the efficient repression of the IL-6 promoter by dexamethasone (Dex) was investigated in HeLa cells transiently transfected with plasmid constructs containing different IL-6 promoter elements linked to the herpesvirus thymidine kinase gene (tk) promoter and the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (cat) and cotransfected with cDNA vectors constitutively expressing either the active wild-type or inactive mutant human glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The induction by interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, phorbol ester, or forskolin of IL-6-tk-cat chimeric constructs containing a single copy of the IL-6 DNA segment from -173 to -151 (MRE I) or from -158 to -145 (MRE II), which derive from within the multiple cytokine- and second-messenger-responsive enhancer (MRE) region, was strongly repressed by Dex in a wild-type GR-dependent fashion irrespective of the inducer used. The induction by pseudorabies virus of an IL-6 construct containing the IL-6 TATA box and the RNA start site (\"initiator\" or Inr element) but not the MRE region was also repressed by Dex in the presence of wild-type GR. DNase I footprinting showed that the purified DNA-binding fragment of GR bound across the MRE, the TATA box, and the Inr site in the IL-6 promoter; this footprint overlapped that produced by proteins present in nuclear extracts from uninduced or induced HeLa cells. Imperfect palindromic nucleotide sequence motifs moderately related to the consensus GR-responsive element (GRE) motif were present at the Inr, the TATA box, and the MRE II site in the IL-6 promoter; although MRE I and a GR-binding site between -201 and -210 in IL-6 both lacked a discernible inverted repeat motif, their sequences showed considerable similarity with negative GRE sequences in other Dex-repressed genes. Surprisingly, chimeric genes containing MRE II, which lacks a recognizable GACGTCA cyclic AMP- and phorbol ester-responsive motif, were strongly induced by both phorbol ester and forskolin, suggesting that MRE II (ACATTGCACAATCT) may be the prototype of a novel cyclic AMP- and phorbol ester-responsive element.

This conclusion is based on the observations that supernatants from Fc region-stimulated PBMC cultures contained increased levels of elements that scored as positive in two assays for IL-6: the B9.9 hybridoma growth and the CESS cell differentiation assays. Moreover, RNA from Fc region-stimulation PBMC contained increased levels of IL-6 cDNA-hybridizable elements. Finally, it was observed that rabbit anti-IL-6 inhibited the ability of supernatants derived from Fc region-stimulated PBMC cultures to induce B9.9 cell proliferation as well as p23-induced ISC formation in intact PBMC cultures.

Moreover, this stimulation of phospholipase A2 was sensitive to dexamethasone. We therefore studied the effects of dexamethasone on DMSO-induced differentiation of U-937 cells. Although dexamethasone had no effect on growth inhibition or loss of clonogenic survival by DMSO, this glucocorticoid blocked increases in NSE staining and cell surface Mac-1 expression. Dexamethasone also had no effect on the down-regulation of c-myc and c-myb expression but blocked the reappearance of c-myb transcripts after 6 hr of DMSO treatment.

This response is likely to be mediated by protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) since the synthetic diacylglycerol, 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, can also induce fibrinogen mRNA. In addition to the alpha, beta, and gamma chains of fibrinogen, other acute phase response mRNAs are induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate including alpha 2-macroglobulin. The active agent capable of inducing the fibrinogen mRNAs in the monocyte supernatants is clearly not interleukin 1 (IL-1) or tumor necrosis factor. The FAZA cell line does not have detectable IL-1 receptors and does not respond to either murine or human IL-1 or the 30-kDa precursor for IL-1. In addition, fibrinogen cannot be induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha in this cell line, and the active agent in monocytes supernatants cannot be neutralized with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies to tumor necrosis factor alpha.

Cross-linking of this receptor on the cell surface by its specific ligands led to the enhancement of B cell proliferation in synergy with T cell factors. In vitro activation of human peripheral B lymphocytes by cross-linking membrane immunoglobulins with anti-mu antibody induced EBV/C3dR phosphorylation. These studies were pursued by analyzing cell-free phosphorylation of EBV/C3dR isolated from Raji cell fractions, and immobilized on OKB7, a monoclonal anti-EBV/C3dR antibody. Three EBV/C3dR-related antigens which could be cell-free phosphorylated were detected: gp140, the EBV/C3dR, p130 and p120. gp140, the mature form of EBV/C3dR, was isolated from plasma membrane and from purified nuclei. p130 was identified as an intracellular intermediate of EBV/C3dR glycosylation, localized in low-density microsomes. Phosphoamino acid analysis of EBV/C3dR allowed the detection of phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine residues. These data suggest that EBV/C3dR could carry an autophosphorylation activity and could be associated to serine kinases. Using polyclonal anti-p120 antibody and anti-120 kDa nuclear ribonucleoprotein monoclonal antibody (mAb), p120 was identified as a nuclear ribonucleoprotein antigenically not related to EBV/C3dR. Detection of p120 on EBV/C3dR, immobilized on OKB7, was due to interactions between both antigens, instead of anti-EBV/C3dR mAb cross-reactivity with p120. Cell-free phosphorylation of p120 was under the control of EBV/C3dR. However, it is not yet established whether other nuclear or membrane components were involved in the control of p120 cell-free phosphorylation by EBV/C3dR.

Several activators of adenylate cyclase, including prostaglandin E1, forskolin, and cholera toxin, as well as the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine and the cAMP analog dibutyryl cAMP, shared the ability to cause a dramatic and sustained increase in IL-6 mRNA levels in human FS-4 fibroblasts. Actinomycin D treatment abolished this enhancement. Treatments that increased intracellular cAMP also stimulated the secretion of the IL-6 protein in a biologically active form. Increased intracellular cAMP appears to enhance IL-6 gene expression by a protein kinase C-independent mechanism because down-regulation of protein kinase C by a chronic exposure of cells to a high dose of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate did not abolish the enhancement of IL-6 expression by treatments that increase cAMP.

Highly purified human rIL-6 was tested. rIL-6 had modest but detectable activity in the D10.G4.1 assay. Maximal enhancement of proliferation induced by IL-6 in the presence of mitogen in the D10.G4.1 assay was always far less than that induced by IL-1. The D10.G4.1 assay was used to test the possibility of synergistic interactions between IL-1 and IL-6. Quantities of IL-6 which alone were not costimulatory to D10 cells enhanced IL-1-induced D10 proliferation significantly when Con A was used as a costimulus. This synergistic response could be partially blocked by antibodies to rIL-6 and fully blocked by a mAb to rIL-1 alpha. In contrast, when 3D3 (a clonotypic activating anti-TCR mAb) was used as a costimulus, no synergistic interaction between IL-1 and IL-6 could be detected. The proliferation of D10 cells induced by IL-1 and 3D3 was unaffected by antibodies to IL-6 but was completely neutralized by antibodies to IL-1. These data suggest that although IL-6 alone cannot substitute for IL-1 in functional assays for IL-1, the presence of IL-6 significantly enhances T cell responses to IL-1 in the context of the appropriate costimulatory signal.

This activity was detectable only when the cells were exposed to LPS (0.1 to 10 micrograms/ml) and for periods longer than one hour. The cytotoxic factor was identified as TNF since: (1) the lytic activity was completely inhibited by an anti-mouse TNF polyclonal antibody and was associated with suppression of lipoprotein lipase activity in adipocytes; (2) its molecular weight (110,000 daltons) corresponded to that observed for murine TNF under non-denaturing conditions; and (3) mRNA encoding TNF was expressed by mesangial cells two hours after addition of LPS. To assess the mechanisms whereby TNF production was regulated, the role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was determined. LPS caused a dose-dependent increase of PGE2 synthesis by mesangial cells. Treatment by indomethacin promoted a suppression of PGE2 production together with an increase of TNF synthesis, indicating that PGE2 acted in a negative feedback manner to regulate the production of TNF. Addition of PGE2 (0.1 to 300 nM) or 8-bromo cyclic AMP (0.1 to 100 microM) induced similar dose-dependent reductions of TNF synthesis.

Initial studies of five tumor cell lines demonstrated that TNF was able to rapidly (within 30 min) modulate tyrosine protein kinase activity of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors on tumor cell lines which were sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of TNF but not alter EGF receptor kinase activity in TNF-resistant tumor cells. Two tumor cell lines (ME-180 cervical carcinoma and T24 bladder carcinoma) which have been shown to express similar TNF-binding characteristics but differ in their sensitivity to the cytotoxic actions of TNF were chosen for further characterization. Treatment of TNF-sensitive ME-180 cells with 1 nM TNF resulted in a 3-fold stimulation of EGF receptor tyrosine protein kinase activity within 10 min which correlated with increased phosphorylation of EGF receptor protein itself. In addition, dose-response studies indicate that similar concentrations of TNF modulate both ME-180 cell growth and EGF receptor kinase activity. Treatment of TNF-resistant T24 cells showed that TNF had no significant effect on their growth, EGF receptor tyrosine protein kinase activity, or phosphorylation of EGF receptor protein although EGF receptor kinase activity was stimulated by EGF. Quantitation of receptors expressed on the surface of ME-180 and T24 cells demonstrated a 3-fold difference between the number of EGF-binding sites on T24 (100,000) versus ME-180 cells (300,000), suggesting the relative abundance of EGF receptor does not solely account for differential effects of TNF on EGF receptor activation in these two cell lines. Phosphoamino acid analysis of EGF receptor from 32P-equilibrated ME-180 cells demonstrated that TNF-induced phosphorylation of amino acids which was quantitatively similar to that of EGF but distinct from the effects of phorbol ester. However, unlike EGF, TNF was unable to stimulate EGF receptor kinase activity in ME-180 cell lysates. The kinetics of EGF receptor activation and the metabolic consequence of activation of EGF receptor activity by TNF appear to be distinct from those induced by EGF.

As brain cells themselves can secrete TNF-like factors upon stimulation, we examined the effect of TNF-alpha on IFN-gamma-mediated class II induction on astrocytes. TNF-alpha alone had no effect on class II expression, but did synergize with IFN-gamma for enhanced expression of class II antigens. The specificity of TNF-alpha activity was demonstrated by blocking the amplifying effect of TNF-alpha with a polyclonal anti-TNF-alpha antibody. Kinetic analysis of the synergistic effect indicated that optimal TNF-alpha enhancement of class II expression was observed when astrocytes were pretreated with IFN-gamma 12-24 h prior to TNF-alpha addition. A possible mechanism for the synergistic action between IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha may be increased TNF-alpha receptor expression by IFN-gamma.

These results suggest that the synergistic activity of TNF-alpha requires an inductive signal from IFN-gamma, which in part may be increased TNF-alpha receptor expression. Altogether, our observations indicate that TNF-alpha enhances ongoing class II major histocompatibility complex gene expression in rat astrocytes, which in this system is initially induced by IFN-gamma. TNF-alpha exerts its effect by binding to high affinity TNF-alpha receptors on astrocytes, whose expression is also enhanced by IFN-gamma. These two cytokines work in concert to elevate class II expression on astrocytes, an event which can contribute to initiation and/or perpetuation of intracerebral immune responses.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "E N", "last_name": "Benveniste", "initials": "EN", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Neurology, University of Alabama, Birmingham 35294."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S M", "last_name": "Sparacio", "initials": "SM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J R", "last_name": "Bethea", "initials": "JR", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Journal of neuroimmunology", "issn": ["0165-5728"], "volume": "25", "issue": "2-3", "pub_year": "1989", "pub_month": "Dec", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "2570036", "doi": null, "title": "CD11/CD18-independent neutrophil adherence to inducible endothelial-leucocyte adhesion molecules (E-LAM) in vitro.", "abstract": "We examined the mechanisms involved in neutrophil adherence to cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HEC) induced by direct stimulation of the neutrophils by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), or the calcium ionophore A23187 (neutrophil-dependent adherence), or by pretreatment of HEC with interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (endothelial-dependent adherence). Two distinct mechanisms for neutrophil adherence to HEC were demonstrated by performing adherence assays: (i) at 37 degrees versus 4 degrees; (ii) in the presence of Ca2+ only versus Mg2+ only; and (iii) in the presence or absence of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to the CD11/CD18 adhesion complex of neutrophils. A CD11/CD18-dependent mechanism (i.e. inhibited by anti-CD18 mAb) was identified that was active in the presence of Mg2+ only but not of Ca2+ only, and at 37 degrees but not at 4 degrees. A CD11/CD18-independent mechanism (i.e. not inhibited by anti-CD18 mAb) was active at 4 degrees and at 37 degrees, and in the presence of Ca2+ only and of Mg2+ only. Neutrophil-dependent adherence induced by FMLP or PMA occurred solely via the CD11/CD18-dependent mechanism, whereas endothelial-dependent adherence induced by a 4-hr pretreatment with IL-1, TNF, or LPS involved both CD11/CD18-dependent and/independent mechanisms. CD11/CD18-deficient neutrophils isolated from a patient with leucocyte adherence deficiency (LAD) maintained the ability to adhere to LPS-pretreated HEC in the presence of Ca2+ only, indicating that this mechanism of adherence involves a receptor on the neutrophil distinct from CD11/CD18. Furthermore, the disappearance of the CD11/CD18-independent, but not of the CD11/CD18-dependent mechanism of adherence, in HEC treated with TNF for 24 hr suggests that the two mechanisms of neutrophil adherence also involve distinct inducible endothelial-leucocyte adhesion molecules (E-LAM).", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "A", "last_name": "Dobrina", "initials": "A", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Institute of General Pathology, University of Trieste, Italy."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "B R", "last_name": "Schwartz", "initials": "BR", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "T M", "last_name": "Carlos", "initials": "TM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "H D", "last_name": "Ochs", "initials": "HD", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "P G", "last_name": "Beatty", "initials": "PG", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J M", "last_name": "Harlan", "initials": "JM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Immunology", "issn": ["0019-2805"], "volume": "67", "issue": "4", "pub_year": "1989", "pub_month": "Aug", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "2571638", "doi": null, "title": "IL-6 and IL-1 synergize to stimulate IL-2 production and proliferation of peripheral T cells.", "abstract": "Purified T cells can be induced to proliferate and to produce the autocrine growth factor IL-2 with mAb to the TCR and costimulatory cytokines.

Here we show that when CD4+ T cells are rigorously purified to greater than 99% CD4+CD8-, they respond only weakly to F23.1 and IL-6. Instead, there is an additional requirement for IL-1, which dramatically synergizes with IL-6 to induce prolonged (greater than 7 days) proliferative responses and IL-2 production. Similar results were observed when the highly mitogenic anti-CD3 mAb 145-2C11 was substituted for F23.1. The proliferation induced by F23.1, IL-1, and IL-6 was substantially (greater than 80%) inhibited by a mAb to mouse IL-2, and was not inhibited by an anti-IL-4-mAb. In accordance with this finding, medium conditioned by the activated CD4+ cells contained large amounts of IL-2, which increased over a 7-day culture period.

Both GM-CSF or IL-6 inhibited [3H]TdR uptake in U937 cells, and simultaneous treatment with GM-CSF and IL-6 resulted in an additive inhibitory effect on cell proliferation.

TNF had no effect on HL-60 cell growth or thymidine incorporation, but it markedly inhibited that of U937 cells.

We have examined the possibility that IFN-beta 2 gene expression is regulated through activation, by diacylglycerol, of the protein kinase C pathway. The synthetic diacylglycerols 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (diC8) and 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol strongly enhanced IFN-beta 2, but not IFN-beta 1, gene expression in human fibroblasts (FS-4 strain).

The enhancement of IFN-beta 2 gene expression by diC8, interleukin 1, or tumor necrosis factor was not prevented by H8, a preferential inhibitor of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases, but was blocked by H7, an inhibitor of protein kinase C as well as of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases. diC8 was found to protect FS-4 cells from the cytopathic effect of vesicular stomatitis virus; this protection was blocked by polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies that neutralize IFN-beta, suggesting that the antiviral effect was due to the secretion of IFN-beta 2 by the diC8-treated fibroblasts.

This was demonstrated by titration of endothelial cell-conditioned medium with t-PA, by reverse fibrin autography, and by immunoprecipitation of [35S]PAI-1 by anti-PAI-1 IgG. TNF also induced a marked increase of PAI-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) in the cells. The stimulation of PAI activity by TNF was seen at 4 U/mL and reached a maximum at 500 U/mL.

Separate additions of TNF or interleukin-1 (IL-1) at optimal concentrations (500 U/mL and 5 U/mL, respectively) resulted in a comparable stimulation of PAI production by endothelial cells. The simultaneous addition of both mediators resulted in an additive effect. The effect of TNF could not be prevented by the addition of polymyxin B or by anti-IL-1 antibodies.

The specific activities of the free [3H]proline pool, which were similar in control and TNF alpha-treated cells, were used to calculate the absolute rates of protein production.

We found no evidence of cellular toxicity in cultured cells treated with TNF alpha. In addition, TNF alpha did not affect cell proliferation as determined by [6-3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. Most of the collagen produced by the cultured fibroblasts was type I. Using hybridization with specific DNA probes there was an approximately 50% decrease in the quantity of procollagen alpha 1(I) mRNA, without changes in the quantity of alpha tubulin mRNA or the size of the transcripts, in cells incubated with TNF alpha. Interleukin-1 (2.5 ng/ml) also decreased the levels of procollagen alpha 1(I) mRNA by approximately 50%. Cycloheximide (0.1 mM), an inhibitor of protein synthesis, blocked the inhibitory effect of both TNF alpha and interleukin-1 on procollagen alpha 1(I) mRNA.

Here, we describe a cytotoxic factor in murine mast cells that is immunologically related to tumor necrosis factor (TNF). This TNF-like factor lyses WEHI-164 cells with a slow time course requiring 16-20 hr for the lytic reaction to complete. Antibodies specific for human and murine TNF and human lymphotoxin partially block mast cell lysis of WEHI-164 cells. These antibodies react on immunoblots with one major mast cell protein band of 50 kDa. Immunoblot analysis shows this factor in cloned and uncloned cultured mouse mast cells and in mature \"connective tissue-type\" mast cells freshly purified from rat or mouse peritoneal cavities. The amount of this factor is greatly enhanced in cells that have been stimulated with a combination of phorbol ester/concanavalin A or bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Subcellular fractionation analysis of mast cells with Percoll gradients reveals two pools of TNF-related cytotoxic activity that are associated with free cytosolic material and granule fractions. In contrast to cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, granule-enriched fractions of mast cells do not contain any hemolytic activity.

We have previously shown that rTNF binds to sections of human kidney and is localized in the same region as uromodulin.

Sera from 20 patients with acute KS, 11 patients in the convalescent phase of KS, and 17 age-matched controls were assessed for complement-dependent cytotoxic activity against 111In-labeled human endothelial cells (HEC), dermal fibroblasts, and vascular smooth muscle cells.

None of the sera tested had cytotoxicity against control HEC cultures or the other target cell types, with or without IL-1 or TNF pretreatment. Expression of the IL-1- or TNF-inducible target antigens on endothelial cells was rapid and transient, peaking at 4 h and disappearing after 24 h despite continued incubation with monokine. In contrast, we have previously shown that IFN-gamma requires 72 h to render HEC susceptible to lysis with acute KS sera.

ICAM-1 protein expression on cardiac myocytes is seen after 6 h of reperfusion, and increases thereafter. Non-ischemic tissue demonstrates no early induction of ICAM-1 mRNA or ICAM-1 protein on myocardial cells. In our most recent experiments, we have determined that reperfusion is an absolute requirement for the early induction of myocardial ICAM-1 mRNA in previously ischemic myocardial cells. To further assess this, we have cloned and sequenced a canine interleukin-6 (IL-6) cDNA. The data suggest that early induction of IL-6 mRNA is also reperfusion dependent as it could be demonstrated in the same ischemic and reperfused segments in which ICAM-1 mRNA was found. Peak expression of IL-6 mRNA occurred much earlier than that for ICAM-1 mRNA. Similar experiments were then performed with a molecular probe for interleukin-8 (IL-8). This chemokine is a potent neutrophil stimulant and has a higher degree of specificity for neutrophils than classic chemoattractants such as C5a.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "G L", "last_name": "Kukielka", "initials": "GL", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Medicine, Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, USA."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "K A", "last_name": "Youker", "initials": "KA", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "L H", "last_name": "Michael", "initials": "LH", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A G", "last_name": "Kumar", "initials": "AG", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "C M", "last_name": "Ballantyne", "initials": "CM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "C W", "last_name": "Smith", "initials": "CW", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M L", "last_name": "Entman", "initials": "ML", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "issn": ["0300-8177"], "volume": "147", "issue": "1-2", "pub_year": null, "pub_month": null, "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "7498526", "doi": "10.1016/0014-5793(95)01237-3", "title": "Structures of genes for two cathelin-associated antimicrobial peptides: prophenin-2 and PR-39.", "abstract": "We characterized genes for prophenin (PF)-2 and PR-39, two cathelin-associated antimicrobial peptides found in porcine leukocytes.

The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 is a widely used model for studying hypoxic induction of the hematopoietic growth factor erythropoietin. In an attempt to identify additional genes expressed in HepG2 cells during hypoxia, we differentially screened a cDNA library derived from hypoxic (1% O2) HepG2 cells using probes isolated from either normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic cells. Two genes were identified, one encoding aldolase, a member of the glycolytic enzymes, and the other encoding alpha 1-antitrypsin which belongs to the family of the acute phase (AP) responsive proteins. Whereas hypoxic induction of glycolytic enzymes is well established, oxygen-dependent regulation of AP genes has not been reported so far. AP proteins are liver-derived plasma proteins whose production during inflammation is either up-regulated (positive AP reactants) or down-regulated (negative AP reactants). In the present study, we demonstrate that on the mRNA level hypoxic stimulation of HepG2 cells led to (i) an induction of the positive AP reactants alpha 1-antitrypsin, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, complement C3, haptoglobin, and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein; (ii) a down-regulation of the negative AP reactant albumin; (iii) an up-regulation of the negative AP reactant transferrin; and (iv) unchanged levels of the positive AP reactants alpha- and beta-fibrinogen as well as hemopexin. Cycloheximide inhibited hypoxic up-regulation of AP mRNAs demonstrating that de novo protein synthesis is required for hypoxic induction. Nuclear run-on assays indicate that the hypoxic increase in AP mRNAs is mainly due to transcriptional regulation. The hypoxic response was compared to AP stimulation by interleukin 6.

We have focused on signal transduction related to the stimulation of IL-6 gene expression by IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha.

Stimulators of the cAMP pathway, such as cholera toxin, forskolin, and dibutyryl cAMP, also induced astrocyte IL-6 gene expression.

The ID50 for iloprost and cicaprost were 8 nM and 5 nM, respectively, compared to 125 nM for PGE2. Moreover, the prostacyclin analogs as well as PGE2 suppressed LPS-induced production of TNF-alpha in Mono Mac 6 cells, a permanent human cell line with characteristics of mature monocytes. Suppression of TNF-alpha synthesis by cicaprost and PGE2 is probably mediated by an increased intracellular cAMP formation. We were able to show elevated cAMP levels with 1 microM and 10 microM of PGE2 and cicaprost in this system. The suppression of TNF-alpha synthesis may add to the beneficial effects of iloprost reported in animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and may offer a therapeutic approach in TNF-alpha mediated pathologic processes.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "T", "last_name": "Eisenhut", "initials": "T", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Medizinische Klinik, Klinikum Innenstadt, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t, M\u00fcnchen, Germany."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "B", "last_name": "Sinha", "initials": "B", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "E", "last_name": "Gr\u00f6ttrup-Wolfers", "initials": "E", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J", "last_name": "Semmler", "initials": "J", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "W", "last_name": "Siess", "initials": "W", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S", "last_name": "Endres", "initials": "S", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Immunopharmacology", "issn": ["0162-3109"], "volume": "26", "issue": "3", "pub_year": null, "pub_month": null, "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "7507190", "doi": "10.1016/0145-2126(94)90004-3", "title": "CD14 mediated endogenous TNF-alpha release in HL60 AML cells: a potential model for CD14 mediated endogenous cytokine release in the treatment of AML.", "abstract": "In previous studies, HL60 AML cells treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), interferon-gamma (IFN), and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) displayed decreased growth and viability, enhanced monocytic pathway differentiation and endogenous TNF release.

To determine the site of interaction of CD23 on CD21, we analyzed the ability of purified recombinant CD23 incorporated into fluorescent liposomes to bind CD21 mutants bearing various deletions of extracytoplasmic short consensus repeats (SCRs). We found that the site of interaction of CD23 on CD21 is on SCRs 5 to 8, with contribution of SCRs 1 and 2. Tunicamycin treatment of CD21-transfected K562 cells strongly inhibited the binding of CD23-liposomes, suggesting that an N-linked sugar, present on SCRs 5 to 8, is involved in the CD23/CD21 interaction. By mutating together or individually, the three asparagines present on SCRs 5 to 8, asparagines (Asn) 370 and 295, but not Asn 492, were shown to be involved critically in the binding of CD23.

In the present study, we examined both the early and delayed effects of interleukin-6 (IL-6) on cultured chick embryo ventricular myocytes. Exposure of these cells to human recombinant IL-6 significantly decreased peak systolic [Ca2+]i (71.0 +/- 0.6% of the control value) and the amplitude of cell contraction (66.0 +/- 7.4% of the control value) within a few minutes. Pretreatment with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) or methylene blue completely inhibited the IL-6-induced early changes. Subsequent addition of L-arginine reversed the effects of L-NMMA. The levels of cGMP were significantly increased after 30 minutes of exposure to IL-6 (134.4 +/- 9.1% of the control value). Pretreatment with L-NMMA or EGTA significantly inhibited the IL-6-induced early elevation of cGMP. These results suggest that IL-6 acutely decreases intracellular Ca2+ transients and depresses cell contraction by nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP-mediated pathway. Therefore, IL-6 may enhance the Ca(2+)-dependent constitutive NO synthase activity in cardiac myocytes. On the other hand, 24-hour exposure to IL-6 also increased the levels of cGMP (159.0 +/- 22.8% of the control value) regardless of pretreatment with EGTA. These delayed increases in cGMP were also shown to be coupled with decreases in intracellular Ca2+ transients and the amplitude of cell contraction.

We have previously shown that neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP) is an important enzyme in neuro- and autoimmunoregulation of both vertebrates and invertebrates, and that activation of human granulocytes by monokines and neuropeptides results in regulation of NEP. Exposure of intact human granulocytes to morphine increases NEP by a naloxone-sensitive mechanism. The increased expression of NEP downregulates the stimulatory effect of substance P and TNF. In the case of substance P, we demonstrate the significance of NEP in modulating the process of downregulation by use of a specific NEP inhibitor, phosphoramidon. These results indicate that morphine is a significant factor in downregulating immunocyte responsiveness to NEP substrates and also to those signal molecules (i.e. cytokines) not metabolized by it.

Protein kinase C represents another important second messenger system involved in the regulation of SMC contraction. We have investigated iNOS expression and NO synthesis in rat vascular SMC treated with the cytokines, IFN gamma and TNF alpha, in the presence or absence of the activator of protein kinase C, beta-phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Treatment with PMA did not induce any significant accumulation of nitrite, a major stable metabolite of NO, in SMC. When added simultaneously with the cytokines, PMA significantly reduced nitrite accumulation induced by cytokine stimulation in a dose-dependent fashion. This inhibitory effect was mediated by activation of PKC since calphostin C, a specific PKC inhibitor, abolished the PMA effect. Further analysis of iNOS mRNA with a rat iNOS cDNA probe demonstrated that addition of PMA reduced expression of SMC iNOS mRNA, indicating that the antagonism in induction of NO synthesis between PMA and the proinflammatory cytokines acts on the transcriptional level. The inhibitory effect of PMA may be mediated via induction of a suppressor of iNOS expression, since pretreatment with PMA reduced NO production after subsequent treatment with cytokines.

Apparent phosphorylation of tyrosine residues was observed in addition to serine/threonine of the EGF receptor by EGF, but only a slightly if any tyrosine phosphorylation by TNF-alpha. In vitro kinase activity of EGF receptor was also enhanced by TNF-alpha as well as by EGF. Furthermore, expression of the c-fos gene was enhanced in response to either EGF or TNF-alpha. Pretreatment of HOME cells with EGF for 12 h almost completely blocked the induction of the c-fos gene by EGF and partially blocked the c-fos induction by TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha-induced c-fos gene expression appeared to be partly due to its transactivation of EGF receptor. EGF and TNF-alpha could enhance c-fos gene expression when protein kinase C was down-regulated by phorbol ester myristate (PMA). Gel retardation assay with the NF-kappa B consensus sequence showed that NF-kappa B binding activity was dramatically activated by TNF-alpha, but not by EGF or PMA. The binding of another transcription factor, AP-1 (Jun/Fos), was enhanced by EGF, TNF-alpha, and PMA, whereas TNF-alpha could still activate AP-1 after longer exposure to EGF.

The extension of these observations to the study of inflammatory processes in different human organs necessitates the development of techniques for the quantification of mRNA in small tissue samples. Here we present a method for the quantification of mRNA for E-selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 using reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). For each molecule of interest a mutant RNA was synthesised consisting of the wild-type sequence deleted of 15-20 bases. The mutant and wild-type RNA sequences are recognised by the same primers, and can therefore be amplified competitively in the same tube by RT-PCR. As the mutant and wild-type RNAs compete for the primers, the amount of wild-type RNA can be determined by the size of the dominant product that results after addition of known quantities of mutant RNA. Using this detection and quantification method we have examined the dose dependency and time course of mRNA accumulation following TNF-alpha stimulation of HUVEC. Similar time-courses of E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 mRNA accumulation were observed by competitive RT-PCR as by laser densitometry of Northern blots.

We have used a model we recently developed to study B cell activation induced by complex particulate Ag, such as immune complexes and viruses, to begin to examine these questions. In the current studies, we incubated purified small resting B cells with 100-nm latex beads bearing various combinations of CD21 ligands and mAbs to CD19, CD35, and the Ag receptor. CD21, CD19, and CD35 have all been implicated in modulating membrane IgM initiated signaling. Beads coated with mAb to the C3dg/EBV-binding portion of CD21, but not mAb to other portions of the CD21 molecule, triggered B cell homotypic aggregation. Beads coated with the same CD21 ligands, although inactive alone, synergized with anti-IgM mAb in greatly increasing (20- to 180-fold) mRNA levels of the c-fos nuclear proto-oncogene. Signaling via CD21 was tyrosine kinase dependent. Levels of c-myc mRNA were not altered by CD21 ligands. Anti-CD19 and anti-CD35 mAb did not augment signaling via membrane IgM as assessed by changes in c-fos mRNA levels.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The cell line was continuously cultured for 16 months, after which time, the proliferative rate, capacity to be cloned, and ability to be transfected was investigated. The cell line was analyzed for expression of endothelial cell markers, von Willebrand Factor, P selectin, and scavenger receptor. We also examined the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated upregulation of E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1. We evaluated the levels of expression and types of TNF-alpha receptor expressed by the cell line, and the cell lines response to interleukin-4 and interferon-gamma. CD34 expression of this cell line and the ability of transforming growth factor-beta to inhibit the TNF-alpha induction of E-selectin was examined. The ability to support neutrophil adhesion and transmigration, and generate capillary-like tubes in vitro was assessed. Finally, the karyotype and tumourigenicity of this line was established. RESULTS: This cell line (C11STH) has a doubling time comparable to that of normal HUVECs and has a trisomy of chromosome 8 and 11. The cell line is capable of generating colonies at clonal density, and is transfectable with efficiencies comparable to normal HUVECs. C11STH expresses von Willebrand factor, P-selectin, and scavenger receptor to an extent similar to passaged HUVECs and can be induced to express E-selectin, VCAM, and ICAM with TNF-alpha. C11STH expresses both the p55 and p75 subunits of TNF-alpha receptor at levels similar to HUVECs. The ability of interleukin-4 to enhance the expression of VCAM and reduce the TNF-alpha-mediated expression of E-selectin is maintained in this cell line. C11STH cells are unable to induce class II major histocompatibility antigen in response to interferon-gamma. However, interferon-gamma is able to synergize with TNF to enhance the expression of E-selectin. C11STH cells do not express CD34 or show transforming growth factor-beta inhibition of TNF-alpha induced E-selectin expression, functions indicative of primary, or early passage HUVECs. The cell line retains the ability to support neutrophil adhesion and transmigration and can generate patent tubes when seeded onto complex basement membrane gels. However, the cell line no longer has the ability to generate capillary-like vessels when seeded onto collagen gels in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. CONCLUSIONS: C11STH has retained many of the normal characteristics of endothelial cells, is able to proliferate at clonal density, and is easily transfectable. The line will provide a useful resource for endothelial cell biology. Its ability to make capillary-like tubes on basement membrane gels, but not on collagen will provide a powerful tool with which to further analyze the processes involved in angiogenesis, and will enable us to define the role of specific proteins in angiogenesis. Since C11STH shows tube competence on Matrigel, but is not tube competent on collagen, our studies suggest that capillary-tube formation on Matrigel and collagen occur via qualitatively different mechanisms. Thus, this cell line provides the opportunity to examine the signalling mechanisms required to generate capillary tube formation. These may include the involvement of matrix molecules, the production of proteases and inhibitors, gene regulation and kinases or phosphatases.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "G W", "last_name": "Cockerill", "initials": "GW", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Hanson Center for Cancer Research, IMVS, Adelaide."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "G", "last_name": "Meyer", "initials": "G", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "L", "last_name": "Noack", "initials": "L", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M A", "last_name": "Vadas", "initials": "MA", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J R", "last_name": "Gamble", "initials": "JR", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology", "issn": ["0023-6837"], "volume": "71", "issue": "4", "pub_year": "1994", "pub_month": "Oct", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "7526821", "doi": "10.1001/archsurg.1994.01420350064008", "title": "Acute-phase hepatocytes regulate liver sinusoidal cell mediator production.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Overproduction of liver sinusoidal cell (LCS) mediators in response to endotoxemia or gram-negative infection that follows tissue injury may contribute to hepatic dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: To better define the role of hepatocyte-derived acute-phase reactants in the regulation of sinusoidal cell mediator production following sequential insults, we tested the hypothesis that interleukin-6 (IL-6) prestimulation alters hepatocyte regulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated sinusoidal cell tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, and nitric oxide production. METHODS: Hepatocytes and LSCs were isolated from Wistar rats, and in vitro responses were compared between LSCs alone and hepatocyte-LSC cocultures. Cocultures and LSCs alone were sequentially stimulated with IL-6 (5000 U/mL) then LPS (dose-response), and culture supernatants were analyzed for TNF (L929 cytolysis), IL-6 (7TD1 proliferation), and nitric oxide (Griess reaction). Induction of acute-phase protein synthesis by the stimulation of hepatocytes with IL-6 and dexamethasone (0.1 mumol/L) was assayed by methionine radiolabeling and SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Coculture levels of messenger RNA for TNF-alpha and IL-6 were examined by RNA extraction and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction with specific primers. RESULTS: Interleukin-6 and dexamethasone signal hepatocyte acute-phase protein synthesis. Prestimulation of cocultures, but not of LSCs alone, with IL-6 inhibits LPS-stimulated IL-6 and nitric oxide production significantly. Bioactivity of TNF is reduced to a lesser extent. Polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated similar levels of TNF and IL-6 message following sequential stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Interleukin-6-stimulated acute-phase hepatocytes limit LPS-stimulated coculture cytokine bioactivity and nitric oxide production.

Megakaryocytopoiesis is also enhanced by other colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), including IL-3, IL-6, and Steel factor (SLF). Dysregulation of neonatal thrombopoiesis predisposes newborns to develop thrombocytopenia during sepsis, despite increased circulating pools of committed thrombopoietic progenitors in newborn cord blood compared with adult. We previously reported reduced expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and IL-3 from stimulated cord mononuclear cells, but increased expression of SLF in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Therefore, we hypothesized that IL-3, IL-6, and SLF might modulate megakaryocytopoiesis by inducing IL-11 expression, and newborns might express altered levels of IL-11 mRNA expression during activated conditions, contributing to the difference in circulating colony-forming unit-megakaryocyte (CFU-Meg) cord and adult blood. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) induced a twofold greater increase in IL-11 mRNA expression in neonatal fibroblasts (NFb) compared with adult fibroblasts (AFb), and a 3.6-fold greater increase in HUVEC than human adult aorta endothelial cells (HAEC) by Northern blot analysis. PMA also induced a threefold greater increase in IL-11 protein production in NFb than AFb. Physiologic agonists IL-1 alpha, transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), and TGF-beta 2 triggered upregulation of IL-11 mRNA expression in both NFb and AFb. However, IL-3, IL-6, PIXY321 (a GM-CSF-IL-3 fusion protein), and SLF failed to upregulate IL-11 mRNA expression from the basal level, while macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) mRNA was significantly induced. These data suggest that the hematopoietic effect of IL-6, SLF, and IL-3 on megakaryocytopoiesis is probably not mediated by secondary IL-11 mRNA expression. Similarly, inflammatory agonists IL-1 beta, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) alone did not upregulate IL-11 expression from the basal level in endothelial cells, whereas intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 were strongly induced. Minimal basal IL-11 expression was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in NFb, AFb, HUVEC and HAEC. The quantitative RT-PCR assay also verified that IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha-stimulated HUVEC and HAEC, and IL-3- and IL-6-stimulated NFb and AFb only expressed minimal levels of IL-11 mRNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "Y", "last_name": "Suen", "initials": "Y", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Division of Hematology/Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital of Orange County, CA 92668."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Chang", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S M", "last_name": "Lee", "initials": "SM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J S", "last_name": "Buzby", "initials": "JS", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M S", "last_name": "Cairo", "initials": "MS", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Blood", "issn": ["0006-4971"], "volume": "84", "issue": "12", "pub_year": "1994", "pub_month": "Dec", "pub_day": "15"}}, {"pmid": "7528280", "doi": null, "title": "FK506, an immunosuppressant, partially inhibits interleukin 6 production by adherent rheumatoid synovial cells.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a new immunosuppressant, FK506, on interleukin 6 (IL-6) production by freshly prepared rheumatoid synovial cells.

We show here that RGPs bind to and stimulate human monocytes to produce TNF-alpha in a dose-dependent manner. To detect cell surface RGPs binding proteins, intact monocytes were biotinylated before lysis with Nonidet P-40 and solubilized proteins were incubated with RGPs Affi-Prep beads. One major membrane protein of 55 kDa was specifically detected and identified as CD14 because it reacted with anti-CD14 mAbs. Furthermore, anti-CD14 mAbs were able to perform a dose-dependent inhibition of RGPs binding, and suppressed TNF-alpha release from RGPs-stimulated monocytes. Moreover, we demonstrated that RGPs also bind to CD11b; however, this binding is not implicated in synthesis of TNF-alpha. Interestingly, RGPs binding to monocytes was enhanced by human normal serum (HNS) whereas HNS inhibits the TNF-alpha-stimulating activity of RGPs. Western blotting analysis of HNS proteins purified on RGPs Affi-prep beads revealed three specific bands of 75, 55, and 32 kDa reactive with anti-C3 Abs, anti-CD14 mAbs (TUK4), and anti-human mannan binding protein (hMBP)-derived peptide IgG, respectively. These results suggest that C3, soluble CD14, and hMBP form complexes that are probably active in enhancing the binding of RGPs to monocytes. Additional studies have shown that hMBP that recognizes RGPs prevents, unlike the LPS binding protein, TNF-alpha release by inhibiting the binding of RGPs to CD14 Ag.

Cell lines that responded to IL-1 alpha, including the CSF-producing lines, expressed receptors for IL-1 alpha. These results indicate that CSF-producing tumours can be characterised by their constitutive IL-1 production, IL-1 receptor expression and IL-1-dependent excess production of G-CSF and IL-6.

The second signal is provided by a physical interaction between B cells and activated T cells, basophils and mast cells, and it has been shown that the CD40/CD40L pairing is crucial for mediating IgE synthesis. In HIGM1 syndrome, which is characterized by greatly decreased levels of IgG, IgA and IgE, there are mutations in CD40L resulting in a completely non-functional extracellular domain. CD40L is therefore playing a central role in Ig switching. Amongst the numerous pairs of surface adhesion molecules, the CD23/CD21 pair seems to play a key role in the generation of IgE. The CD23 molecule is positively and negatively regulated by factors which increase or decrease IgE production, respectively. Antibodies to CD23 have been shown to inhibit IL-4-induced human IgE production in vitro and to inhibit antigen-specific IgE responses in a rat model, in an isotype-selective manner.

Infection of B lymphocytes depends on a direct interaction between the viral glycoprotein gp340/220 and CD21, the C3dg complement receptor. This interaction is required for the adsorption of EBV. In addition, several lines of evidence suggest that the interaction of EBV with CD21 modulates the phenotype of cells. CD21 forms part of a multimeric signal transduction complex with CD19, TAPA-1, and Leu-13. In normal B lymphocytes, CD19 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation of the antigen receptor and recruits the signal-transducing enzyme phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase kinase. Here, we investigated the involvement of signal transduction pathways in efficient infection. Protein synthesis is not required for events leading to the transcription of the viral genome, suggesting that the early stages of infection do not depend on the expression of novel cell genes and consistent with the Wp promoter being the first viral promoter used upon infection. Since the stimulation of cells with gp340/220 leads to an increase in the level of CD19 tyrosine phosphorylation, we investigated the potential contribution of both tyrosine and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase kinases to efficient infection. Both kinases contribute to the posttranscriptional control of viral gene expression following infection, but neither is required for the entry or initial transcription of the virus.

We wondered whether pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha may be involved in the regulation of human IL-10 synthesis. TNF-alpha induced de novo IL-10 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner but no IL-10 protein in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Furthermore, LPS-induced IL-10 gene and protein expression was significantly inhibited by neutralizing anti-TNF-alpha mAb. On the basis of these results, we conclude that TNF-alpha is involved in the up-regulation of its antagonist IL-10. Paradoxically, drugs that effectively inhibit expression of TNF-alpha via the elevation of intracellular cAMP level (iloprost, pentoxifylline, prostaglandin E2 and N6,2-O-dibutyryl cAMP) augmented the endotoxin-induced IL-10 synthesis at both protein and mRNA levels. In order to provide a basis for the analysis of the transcriptional regulation of the human IL-10 gene, we isolated a fragment of the human IL-10 gene containing 1308 bp of the 5' non-coding sequence. It shows remarkable homology to the mouse IL-10 promoter in regions that have been associated with transcriptional regulation, including a cAMP responsive element which could explain the cAMP-mediated effects.

In previous work, we had seen that exposure of human monocytes to HIV-1, including inactivated, noninfectious HIV, led to rapid IL-6 gene expression and secretion. To investigate cytokine production in response to components of HIV by monocytes/macrophages, production of IL-6 and IL-10 were examined in a human monocytic cell line, THP-1, stimulated by HIV proteins. IL-6 production was induced in THP-1 cells by a detergent lysate of HIV, particularly fractions at molecular weight of 25-50 kDa. Recombinant HIV envelope glycoprotein 41 (gp41), but not gp120 or p24, also was seen to induce significant IL-6 production by THP-1 cells. These results suggest that gp41, transmembrane protein, is the primary HIV-encoded protein involved in inducing IL-6 production. IL-10 was also produced with delayed kinetics, following IL-6 production in THP-1 cells stimulated by gp41. To investigate a possible regulatory role for IL-10 in HIV-induced monokine production, recombinant IL-10 was added to gp41-exposed THP-1 cells. IL-10 inhibited gp41-induced IL-6 production and reduced the expression of IL-6 mRNA. When anti-human IL-10 neutralizing antibody was added to THP-1 cells, IL-6 production was enhanced.

Electrical stimulation substantially reduced IL-6 secretion at 6 h (control: 143.4 +/- 14.3 vs. electrical: 71.3 +/- 7.9 pg/ml/10(6) leukocytes, P = 0.0001). This effect was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (P = 0.0298, EC50 approx. 10(-7) M). In conclusion, this new technique allows long-term investigation of cell function in slices of murine spleen.

Since most T cells are present subjacent to the pocket epithelium in conjunction with the plasma cells, it is important to know how these T cells are affected by short-chain fatty acids produced by subgingival plaque. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of extracellular metabolites from periodontopathic bacteria on the proliferation and cytokine production of mouse splenic cells as a potential mechanism of imbalance among host-microbial interactions. A low-molecular-weight, heat-stable agent present in the two-day culture filtrate of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella loescheii, and Fusobacterium nucleatum significantly depressed Con A- and LPS- induced cell proliferation. To determine whether short-chain fatty acids present in the filtrate could account for the depression, we tested extracted volatile and non-volatile fatty acids for their effects on mitogenic activity. The volatile fatty acids extracted from immunosuppressive supernatants greatly inhibited T- and B- cell proliferation. Among these volatile fatty acids, butyric, propionic, valeric, and isovaleric acids impaired cell proliferation dose-dependently. From gas-liquid chromatographic analysis data, it is suggested that immuno-inhibitory activities in culture filtrates are mainly attributable to butyric and isovaleric acids in P. gingivalis, to propionic, butyric, and isovaleric acids in P. loescheii, and to butyric acid in F. nucleatum.

To study the mechanism of inhibition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in human monocytes by manoalide and scalaradial, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced prostaglandin biosynthesis and induction of prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS) were evaluated. LPS (10 ng/mL) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta, 50-1000 ng/mL) but not tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha, 300 ng/mL) induced the expression of the PGHS-2 isoform as determined by immunoblot analysis with a specific polyclonal antibody for PGHS-2. Manoalide and scalaradial (1-10 microM) inhibited LPS-induced endogeneous PGE2 production, reduced the LPS-induced PGHS activity, and reduced the expression of PGHS-2. Indomethacin [a PGHS inhibitor (0.01 to 0.1 microM)], zileuton [a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor (3-10 microM)], and WEB-2806 [a platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist (30 microM)] did not affect the LPS-induced expression of PGHS-2 in human monocytes. These results suggest that modulation of lipid mediator production by manoalide or scalaradial may not be involved in the observed effects on the expression of PGHS-2. Manoalide and scalaradial also inhibited the release of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha from LPS-stimulated monocytes. Expression of PGHS-2 induced by either LPS or IL-1 beta was blocked by the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra, 2 micrograms/mL) but not by rolipram, a phosphodiesterase IV inhibitor that inhibits TNF alpha but not IL-1 beta release. Similar to LPS, IL-1 beta-induced PGHS-2 expression was apparently not regulated by lipid mediators such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes or PAF as determined with specific inhibitors and antagonists. Scalaradial and to some extent manoalide were capable of blocking the IL-1 beta-induced expression of PHGS-2. These results indicate that IL-1 beta is the predominant cytokine responsible for the induction of PGHS-2 in the human monocyte.

Transient transfections were performed in bovine aortic endothelial cells to investigate the role of two fundamentally different AP-1 sites and a closely located NF-kappa B site in the human TF promoter. The NF-kappa B site is functionally active, since overexpression of NF-kappa B(p65) resulted in induction of TF mRNA and activity. Promoter analysis showed that NF-kappa B induction was dependent on the integrity of the region from base pair -188 to -181. Over-expression of Jun/Fos resulted in TF induction of transcription and protein/activity. Functional studies revealed that the proximal AP-1 site, but not the distal, was inducible by Jun/Fos heterodimers. The distal AP-1 site, which has a G-->A switch at position 4, was inductible by Jun homodimers. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays, using extracts of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha)-stimulated bovine aortic endothelial cells, demonstrated TNF alpha-inducible binding to the proximal AP-1 site, comprising JunD/Fos heterodimers. At the distal AP-1 site, only minor induction of binding activity, characterized as proteins of the Jun and ATF family, was observed. Consistently, this site only marginally participates in TNF alpha induction. Functional studies with TF promotor plasmids confirmed that deletion of the proximal AP-1 or the NF-kappa B site decreased TNF alpha-mediated TF induction to a higher extend than loss of the distal AP-1 site. However, integrity of both AP-1 sites and the NF-kappa B site was required for optimal TNF alpha stimulation. The relevance of these in vitro data was confirmed in vivo in a mouse tumor model. Expression plasmids for a dominant negative Jun mutant or I-kappa B were packaged in liposomes. When either mutated Jun or I-kappa B were injected intravenously 48 h before TNF alpha, a reduction in TNF alpha-mediated TF expression in the tumor endothelial cells was observed. Simultaneously, fibrin/fibrinogen deposition decreased and free blood flow could be restored. Thus, TNF alpha-induced up-regulation of endothelial cell TF depends on a concerted action of members of the bZIP and NF-kappa B family.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "A", "last_name": "Bierhaus", "initials": "A", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Medicine, University of Heidelberg, Germany."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "Y", "last_name": "Zhang", "initials": "Y", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "Y", "last_name": "Deng", "initials": "Y", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "N", "last_name": "Mackman", "initials": "N", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "P", "last_name": "Quehenberger", "initials": "P", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Haase", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "T", "last_name": "Luther", "initials": "T", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "M\u00fcller", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "H", "last_name": "B\u00f6hrer", "initials": "H", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J", "last_name": "Greten", "initials": "J", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "issn": ["0021-9258"], "volume": "270", "issue": "44", "pub_year": "1995", "pub_month": "Nov", "pub_day": "03"}}, {"pmid": "7593416", "doi": "10.1210/jcem.80.11.7593416", "title": "Acute effects of interferon-alpha administration on thyroid hormone metabolism in healthy men.", "abstract": "Both hyper- and hypothyroidism have been reported during prolonged recombinant human interferon-alpha (rhIFN alpha) therapy.

There were no effects of rhIFN alpha on plasma T4 and free T4 or on thyroid hormone binding index. However, rhIFN alpha induced a significant decrease in the plasma concentrations of TSH (P < 0.03) and T3 (P < 0.02) compared with those in the control study, associated with an increase in rT3 concentrations (P < 0.02). IFN alpha induced a moderate increase in interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations (P < 0.02 vs. control study), whereas IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor concentrations remained below the detection limit in all subjects.

The adherence at IFN gamma-treated endothelial cells was strong after a coculture duration of 10 min with a slight increase up to 60 min. The peak value after TNF alpha stimulation was reached after 15 min, thereafter quickly decreasing. IL-1 and Pred treatment caused a maximal adherence between 15 and 30 min followed by a slow decrease. TNF alpha and particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6) enhanced the endothelial adhesion of the monocyte subtype RM3/1, which is associated with the downregulation of inflammation. The maximal adherence was found after 15 and 30 min of coculture, respectively.

Furthermore, expression of inhibitory molecules for Rho-related GTPases and dominant negative mutants of Rac1 and Cdc42 block JNK activation by oncogenic exchange factors or after induction by inflammatory cytokines and growth factors.

However, histamine released during trauma and major surgery may play a significant role in the process. Previously, we showed that the histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA), ranitidine, reduced trauma-induced suppression of certain immunological parameters. STUDY DESIGN: The effect of perioperative ranitidine on postoperative change in plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels was assessed in 23 women undergoing elective abdominal hysterectomy. The patients were randomized to receive intravenous ranitidine, 100 mg twice a day from skin incision, for two days, followed by oral ranitidine, 150 mg twice a day, for a further three days, or no ranitidine. Interleukin-6 and CRP were analyzed in plasma and serum, respectively, drawn preoperatively and six, 24, 48, and 120 hours after skin incision. RESULTS: Routine blood analyses, clinical data (except age), duration of surgery, anesthesia, antibiotic prophylaxis, blood loss, and perioperative blood transfusion were similar in the two groups. Interleukin-6 levels were significantly increased in all patients and without difference between the ranitidine-treated and non-ranitidine-treated patients after six, 24, and 48 hours compared to preoperative levels, respectively. C-reactive protein levels were also significantly increased in all patients after 24, 48, and 120 hours, respectively; however, at 48 hours, CRP was significantly reduced in ranitidine-treated patients compared with non-ranitidine-treated patients (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that histamine-2 receptor activation mechanisms may not be involved in postoperative IL-6 synthesis. However, the reduced CRP level in ranitidine-treated patients suggests that H2RAs modulate IL-6 signal transduction in hepatic cells.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "L A", "last_name": "Rasmussen", "initials": "LA", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Surgery, Frederikssund Hospital, Denmark."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "H J", "last_name": "Nielsen", "initials": "HJ", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S", "last_name": "S\u00f8rensen", "initials": "S", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "C", "last_name": "S\u00f8rensen", "initials": "C", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "R", "last_name": "Rasmussen", "initials": "R", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S", "last_name": "S\u00f8rensen", "initials": "S", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "F", "last_name": "Moesgaard", "initials": "F", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J", "last_name": "Larsen", "initials": "J", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Journal of the American College of Surgeons", "issn": ["1072-7515"], "volume": "181", "issue": "2", "pub_year": "1995", "pub_month": "Aug", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "7640674", "doi": "10.1111/j.1574-695X.1995.tb00100.x", "title": "Lipid A-associated proteins from periodontopathogenic bacteria induce interleukin-6 production by human gingival fibroblasts and monocytes.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine whether lipid A-associated proteins (LAP) from two periodontopathogenic species of bacteria were able to stimulate interleukin-6 (IL-6) release from human gingival fibroblasts and myelomonocytic cells.

This balance is disturbed in postmenopausal women as a result of lower serum estrogen levels. Estrogen, which is used in hormone replacement therapy to prevent postmenopausal osteoporosis, downregulates expression of the interleukin 6 (IL-6) gene in osteoblasts and bone marrow stromal cells. IL-6 is directly involved in bone resorption by activating immature osteoclasts. We show here that NF-kappa B and C/EBP beta are important regulators of IL-6 gene expression in human osteoblasts. Importantly, the IL-6 promoter is inhibited by estrogen in the absence of a functional estrogen receptor (ER) binding site. This inhibition is mediated by the transcription factors NF-kappa B and C/EBP beta. Evidence is presented for a direct interaction between these two factors and ER. We characterized the protein sequence requirements for this association in vitro and in vivo. The physical and functional interaction depends in part on the DNA binding domain and region D of ER and on the Rel homology domain of NF-kappa B and the bZIP region of C/EBP beta. The cross-coupling between ER, NF-kappa B, and C/EBP beta also results in reduced activity of promoters with ER binding sites.

Moreover, it is widely accepted that osteoclast formation depends on cells of the stromal/osteoblastic lineage. The appreciation of the ontogeny of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, the interaction between them, and the role of local factors that regulate their development has led to the emergence of new insights into the pathophysiology of the osteopenias associated with estrogen deficiency and senescence. Consistent with histomorphometric data from humans, there is now evidence from studies in animal models suggesting that a critical cellular change caused by the loss of ovarian, as well as testicular, function is an increase in osteoclastogenesis. This change is apparently mediated by an increase in the production of the osteoclastogenic cytokine interleukin-6 by cells of the bone marrow, which follows the removal of an inhibiting control of estrogens or androgens on IL-6. The inhibiting effect of sex steroids on IL-6 production is mediated by their respective receptors and is exerted indirectly on the transcriptional activity of the proximal 225 bp sequence of the IL-6 gene promoter. Besides its effects on IL-6 production, loss of gonadal function may also cause an increase in the sensitivity of the osteoclastic precursors to the action of cytokines such as IL-6, due to an upregulation of the gp130 signal transduction pathway.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "S C", "last_name": "Manolagas", "initials": "SC", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock 72205, USA."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "T", "last_name": "Bellido", "initials": "T", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "R L", "last_name": "Jilka", "initials": "RL", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "International journal of immunopharmacology", "issn": ["0192-0561"], "volume": "17", "issue": "2", "pub_year": "1995", "pub_month": "Feb", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "7662773", "doi": null, "title": "Cytokine-induced release of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 by human mesothelial cells.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To see what effect the inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) had, both alone and in combination, on the production of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) by human mesothelial cells.

APRF bound to IL-6 response elements in the 5'-flanking regions of various acute-phase protein genes (e.g., the alpha 2-macroglobulin, fibrinogen, and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein genes).

In HepG2 cells, activation of APRF was observed within minutes after stimulation with IL-6 or leukemia-inhibitory factor and did not require ongoing protein synthesis. Therefore, a preexisting inactive form of APRF is activated by a posttranslational mechanism. We present evidence that this activation occurs in the cytoplasm and that a phosphorylation is involved.

Peripheral blood monocytes have been found to be sources of a variety of cytokines, but isolated marrow macrophages have not been characterized in this regard. Marrow macrophages form a predominant component of murine adherent Dexter stromal cells and can be isolated by sequential explant culture in colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1). We have studied murine (Balb/c) bone marrow macrophage (BMM) cytokine production in the presence or absence of CSF-1, the lectin pokeweed mitogen (PWM) or interleukin-3 (IL-3). Biologic activity in conditioned media (cm) from control and induced BMM was assessed using the factor-dependent cell lines 32D, NFS-60, T1165, MC-6 and FDC-P1. Cell line stimulation and antibody blocking indicated the presence of c-kit ligand, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). This stimulatory activity was increased by exposure to PWM or the combination of CSF-1 and PWM or CSF-1 and IL-3. CSF-1, as determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA), was essentially undetectable in baseline cm and induction was not seen with PWM or CSF-1. Baseline or \"constitutive\" expression of BMM and mRNA for CSF-1 and c-kit ligand was seen. Uninduced BMM did not express mRNA for G-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), IL-6 or IL-3. CSF-1 induced increased expression of IL-6 mRNA, PWM induced increased expression of G-CSF and IL-6 mRNA and the combination of PWM and CSF-1 induced expression of CSF-1, G-CSF and IL-6 mRNA. Varying levels of CSF-1 had differential effects on cytokine production. Increasing levels of CSF-1 increased IL-6 mRNA and downmodulated CSF-1 mRNA expression. There was a biphasic response of c-kit ligand mRNA expression to CSF-1 exposure; low levels of CSF-1 (50 U/mL) induced, while higher levels (2000 U/mL) inhibited, expression.

Its expression is regulated by cytokines, in part through two kappa B-like regulatory elements. Because NF-kappa B can be composed of multiple alternative subunits with differential effects on gene expression, the role of different specific NF-kappa B family members subunits in VCAM-1 regulation is unknown. In this report, we define the contribution of different NF-kappa B family members to VCAM-1 gene regulation. We show that both kappa B sites in the VCAM-1 enhancer are required to optimally stimulate gene expression, but the enhancer is differentially regulated by specific combinations of NF-kappa B subunits. At low concentrations, RelA(p65) acted in concert with the approximately 50-kDa product of p105 NF-kappa B, NF-kappa B1(p50), to stimulate transcription, and at high concentrations, RelA(p65) alone stimulated the VCAM-1 promoter. In contrast, NF-kappa B2 inhibited functional activation of the VCAM reporter by p65. Consistent with this finding, an additional binding complex was detected by using recombinant NF-kappa B2(p49)/RelA(p65) with radiolabeled VCAM kappa B site probes. Interestingly, the human immunodeficiency virus enhancer responded differently to stimulation by NF-kappa B subunits, with optimal response to p49(100)/p65. Analysis of NF-kappa B mRNA in human umbilical vein endothelial cells revealed that nfkb1, nfkb2, and relA NF-kappa B but not c-rel were induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha and lipopolysaccharide, which also induce VCAM-1.

D., Jain, R. K., Matta, K. L., Sabesan, S., and Varki, A. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 7523-7532). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HEC) treated with inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) display increases in cell-surface CD22 ligands, caused by increased expression of the enzyme beta-galactoside alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase (Hanasaki, K., Varki, A., Stamenkovic, I., and Bevilacqua, M. P. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 10637-10643; Hanasaki, K., Varki, A., and Powell, L. D. (1995) J. Biol Chem. 270, 7533-7542). Thus, CD22 could direct potential interactions between mature B cells and endothelial cells during inflammatory states. However, this would have to occur in the presence of blood plasma, which contains many sialoglycoproteins known to carry alpha 2-6-linked sialic acids. We show here that human plasma can indeed inhibit Sia-dependent binding of a recombinant soluble chimeric form of human CD22 (CD22Rg) to TNF-alpha activated HEC. Affinity adsorption of individual human plasma samples with immobilized CD22Rg showed that, of the numerous alpha 2-6-sialic acid containing glycoproteins in plasma, only three polypeptides with apparent molecular mass (under reducing conditions) of 74, 44, and 25 kDa bound, and were specifically eluted with alpha 2-6-sialyllactose. NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing of these high affinity CD22 ligands revealed that they are subunits of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and haptoglobin. Purified human IgM from pooled human plasma can be quantitatively bound by CD22Rg, and binding is blocked by alpha 2-6-sialyllactose, but not by alpha 2-3-sialyllactose. Pretreatment by sialidase or by mild periodate oxidation of sialic acid side chains abolishes these interactions. IgM at physiological concentrations also inhibits CD22Rg binding to TNF-alpha-activated HEC in a manner dependent not only upon its sialylation but also requiring its intact multimeric structure. These data show that CD22 is capable of highly selective recognition of certain multimeric plasma sialoglycoproteins that carry alpha 2-6-linked sialic acids. Notably, the two proteins that are selectively recognized are known to be involved in immune and inflammatory responses.

Five days after the infliction of the wound, the relative abundance of GFAP in the tissue surrounding the wound site was greater than those of intact controls. Injection of PRL into the wound site markedly increased GFAP expression in the hypothalamus. Western blot analysis failed to detect TNF-alpha in the hypothalamus of non-wounded animals.

To confirm the PRL-induced increase in TNF-alpha levels, TNF-alpha levels in hypothalamic extracts were measured by bioassay. In non-wounded controls, low but detectable TNF-alpha levels were found in the hypothalamus by bioassay (0.13 +/- 0.02 ng/mg protein). Infliction of a hypothalamic wound markedly increased TNF-alpha levels to 1.4 +/- 0.3 ng/mg protein. Injection of PRL into the wound site resulted in a further increase in TNF-alpha levels to 11.4 +/- 2.6 ng/mg protein.

TNF-alpha increased release of tissue factor (TF)-related procoagulant activity that, through generation of factor Xa, promotes assembly of the prothrombinase complex at the cell surface.

Fibrinolytic activity was inhibited by actinomycin D and cyclohexamide, but changes in mRNAs for uPA, tPA, PAI-1, and TF by either cytokine were not appreciable. PAI-2 mRNA was not found.

Vasoactive intestinal peptide strongly increased, in a dose-dependent manner, interleukin 6 production.

Forskolin caused a concentration-dependent increase in interleukin 6 release, that was also inhibited by KT-5720. Since prostaglandins are believed to play a role in interleukin 6 production, we tried to determine whether the stimulatory effects of vasoactive intestinal peptide and forskolin on cytokine release might be mediated by stimulation of prostaglandin production in cortical astrocytes. Vasoactive intestinal peptide did not increase the production of either prostaglandin E2 or F2 alpha. Conversely, forskolin concentration-dependently stimulated the production of both prostaglandins, an effect that was blocked by indomethacin. Indomethacin did not affect either vasoactive intestinal peptide- or forskolin-stimulated interleukin 6 production. To exclude the possibility that prostaglandins participate in interleukin 6 production induced by forskolin, we tested the effect of prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha on the cytokine production. The former was completely ineffective in eliciting the cytokine production, while prostaglandin F2 alpha slightly increase interleukin 6 only at the highest concentration. 8-Br-cAMP and (BU)2- cAMP stimulated interleukin 6 production to a lesser extent than vasoactive intestinal peptide and forskolin. In conclusion, we provide evidence that vasoactive intestinal peptide increases interleukin 6 production by astrocytes through the stimulation of the cAMP-protein kinase-A pathway, an effect that is reproduced by cAMP analogues.

This mechanism is suggested by the finding that LTB4 is able to mimic cytokine-induced strip relaxation only in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which selectively activates protein kinase C.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "P", "last_name": "Montuschi", "initials": "P", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Institute of Pharmacology, Catholic University School of Medicine, Rome, Italy."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "G", "last_name": "Tringali", "initials": "G", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "L", "last_name": "Parente", "initials": "L", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "P", "last_name": "Preziosi", "initials": "P", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "P", "last_name": "Navarra", "initials": "P", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Pharmacological research", "issn": ["1043-6618"], "volume": "30", "issue": "1", "pub_year": "1994", "pub_month": "Jul", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "7834741", "doi": "10.1016/0092-8674(95)90404-2", "title": "Dimerization of cell surface receptors in signal transduction.", "abstract": null, "author_list": [{"fore_name": "C H", "last_name": "Heldin", "initials": "CH", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Biomedical Center, Uppsala, Sweden."], "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Cell", "issn": ["0092-8674"], "volume": "80", "issue": "2", "pub_year": "1995", "pub_month": "Jan", "pub_day": "27"}}, {"pmid": "7836389", "doi": "10.1074/jbc.270.3.1261", "title": "Two distinct signalling pathways are involved in the control of the biphasic junB transcription induced by interleukin-6 in the B cell hybridoma 7TD1.", "abstract": "We have measured the level of junB mRNA in the B hybridoma cell line 7TD1, under interleukin-6 (IL-6) stimulation. IL-6 increases junB mRNA in a biphasic fashion. The first early-induced peak was transient and likely corresponds to the well documented typical junB mRNA, stimulated in response to numerous growth factors, including IL-6. At variance, the second peak which has never been reported previously, lasted several hours. As a consequence of its effect on junB mRNA, IL-6 stimulated, in a biphasic fashion, the nuclear accumulation of the JunB protein. In this study, we demonstrated that IL-6 regulation occurred exclusively at the transcriptional level and that the bimodal increase of junB mRNA and JunB protein can be accounted for by a biphasic stimulation of junB transcription. Furthermore, our data point to two major differences between the mechanism of control of the early and the late IL-6-induced junB transcription waves. First, cycloheximide strongly potentiated the transcription of the second wave, whereas it failed to affect the early-induced burst. Second, tyrphostin, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, impaired the expression of the first but not the second junB mRNA peak. Conversely, genistein, another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, totally abolished the expression of the second peak of junB mRNA whereas it did not affect the expression of the first peak. Altogether these data indicate that, in 7TD1 cells, IL-6 controls junB transcription in a biphasic fashion by means of two separate transduction pathways.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "R", "last_name": "Rezzonico", "initials": "R", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["INSERM U364, Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine, Nice, France."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "G", "last_name": "Ponzio", "initials": "G", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A", "last_name": "Loubat", "initials": "A", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "D", "last_name": "Lallemand", "initials": "D", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A", "last_name": "Proudfoot", "initials": "A", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "B", "last_name": "Rossi", "initials": "B", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "issn": ["0021-9258"], "volume": "270", "issue": "3", "pub_year": "1995", "pub_month": "Jan", "pub_day": "20"}}, {"pmid": "7836779", "doi": "10.1016/0022-1759(94)00254-t", "title": "Characterization of the apoptotic effects of human tumor necrosis factor: development of highly rapid and specific bioassay for human tumor necrosis factor and lymphotoxin using human target cells.", "abstract": "Currently available bioassays for most cytokines require several days and therefore must be performed under sterile conditions.

Unlike IL-10 and TGF-beta, which appear to act as downmodulators of many phagocytic cell functions, the mode of action of IL-4 and IL-13 is more complex. Addition of IL-4 and IL-13 to peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures inhibited production of IL-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-10, and IL-1 beta induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Staphylococcus aureus added simultaneously with the cytokines. However, pretreatment of PBMC with IL-4 or IL-13 for > or = 20 h enhanced the production of IL-12 and TNF-alpha in response to LPS or S. aureus several fold in these cells; this IL-4-induced priming for the two cytokines was inhibited by anti-IL-4 neutralizing antibodies. IL-4 priming also enhanced the accumulation of IL-12 and TNF-alpha mRNA induced by LPS and S. aureus.

In agreement with earlier studies hydrogen peroxide activated NF kappa B in Jurkat, although only at much higher concentrations (10 mM) than those previously reported. However, hydrogen peroxide failed to activate in the two other cell lines under a range of conditions. Similarly, N-acetylcysteine only proved inhibitory in hydrogen peroxide and TNF treated Jurkat and failed to inhibit IL1 and TNF-activated NF kappa B in EL4.NOB-1 and KB cells respectively. N-Acetylcysteine inhibited IL1-induced interleukin-2 in EL4, however, demonstrating that N-acetylcysteine was biologically active. These results suggest that the reactive oxygen model of NF kappa B activation may be cell-type restricted. In contrast to the results with N-acetylcysteine, the antioxidant and metal chelator, pyrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) inhibited NF kappa B activation, although these effects may be unrelated to any antioxidant properties. PDTC also inhibited IL1-induced interleukin-2. Finally, studies with the pro-oxidant diamide showed that this could not activate NF kappa B in any of the cells and in contrast proved inhibitory.

In this study, we have examined the hypothesis that IL-1 beta may stimulate bone loss by inducing the activity of plasminogen activators (PAs) in bone cultures. The latter would convert plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn can activate precursor procollagenase to collagenase. Active collagenase would then break down the bone collagen matrix.

After preliminary studies demonstrated the cPLA2 gene is expressed in a variety of human tissues and was localized to the q arm of chromosome 1 between markers F13B and D1S74, we cloned and characterized the 5'-flanking region of this gene in order to identify the elements controlling its low level constitutive expression. The 5'-flanking region has features typical of a housekeeping gene with no TATA box or CAAT box, although atypical in that it is not GC rich, has no SP1 sites, and has a long run of CA repeats. Analysis of fragments of the 5'-flanking region demonstrated that 541 bp 5' to exon 1 supported reporter gene activity at a level 30% of the SV40 promoter. Interestingly, similar activity was observed by deleting most of the 5'-flanking region down to a 27 bp region containing a sequence with homology to the initiator sequence in the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase gene and a polypyrimidine tract similar to the initiator element of the mouse ribosomal protein gene. Within this 27 bp region, a 10 bp fragment (-17 to -8 bp) within the polypyrimidine tract is critical for the baseline expression of the human cPLA2 gene. While the 5'-flanking region contains a putative composite AP-1 and glucocorticoid response element, this region does not respond to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and/or glucocorticoids in a cell line (HEp-2) that exhibits upregulation of cPLA2 mRNA transcript levels by TNF.

ICAM-1 plays an important role in a variety of inflammatory and immune mediated mechanisms, including recruitment and targeting of lymphocytes. We observed the effects of cytokines on expression of rat homologue of human intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in rat thyroid cell line, FRTL-5. METHODS: We have examined expression of rat intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54), a homologue of human intercellular adhesion molecule-1, by immunocytochemistry (immunoperoxidase staining) in the continuously growing rat thyroid cell line, FRTL-5. RESULTS: Low level of ICAM-1 expression was noted at basal condition and this basal expression was not influenced by thyrotropin. Expression in rat homologue of ICAM-1 is increased by interferon-gamma, interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6 with a dose dependent manner. CONCLUSION: These results show that a pure line of rat thyroid cells can express an ICAM-1 homologue and this is directly enhanced by cytokines such as rat interferon-gamma, human interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6.

To further examine the role of amino acids 1199-1210 in the binding of the C3 fragments iC3b and C3dg to CR2, the following alanine-substitution variants of human C3 were tested in two independent CR2-binding assays: ED1199,1200AA; KQ1203,1204AA; L1205A; Y1206A; NV1207,1208AA; E1209A; and ED-KQ-NV1199,1200-1203,1204-1207,1208AA-AA-AA.

LPS-dependent NF-kappa B activation was inhibited by protein kinase inhibitors, such as staurosporine, herbimycin A, tyrphostin, and genistein, but not mitogen-activated protein kinase substrate, cGMP-dependent protein kinase, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitory peptides, suggesting that staurosporine-sensitive kinase(s) as well as tyrosine kinase(s) are involved in LPS-mediated NF-kappa B activation. In addition, LPS induced the phosphorylation of I kappa B-alpha, starting at 5 min after the stimulation in a cell-free system.

While inanition contributes to cachexia, this wasting diathesis has little in common with simple starvation. The cachexia syndrome is characterized by progressive weight loss and depletion of lean body mass in excess to that resulting from comparable caloric restriction. Accelerated mobilization and consumption of host protein stores from peripheral tissues occurs to support gluconeogenesis and acute phase protein synthesis [1, 2]. In contrast, simple starvation is associated with a relative sparing of lean tissue with the preferential consumption of fat. While the clinical manifestations of cachexia are readily apparent, identification of the specific mechanisms responsible for the development of cachexia remains an enigma. In recent years, interest has focused on the role that the immune system plays in the development of cachexia. Investigators initially hypothesized that the chronic production of two inflammatory cytokines, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and/or interleukin-1 (IL-1), could explain the host non-specific responses resulting in cachexia [3-5]. Other pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) [6, 7] and interferon-gamma [8, 9], have been more recently proposed to be involved in this complex process. Although no consensus exists for the exclusive role of any one cytokine in the pathogenesis of cachexia, there is growing acceptance that the progression of cachexia results in part from the inappropriate release of one or more pro-inflammatory cytokines [10, 11].

Based on its activities on human monocytes and B cells this gene was designated IL-13. In the present study we investigated the effects of IL-13 alone or in combination with IL-4, IFN-gamma, or IL-10 on human monocytes. IL-13 induced significant changes in the phenotype of monocytes. Like IL-4, it enhanced the expression of CD11b, CD11c, CD18, CD29, CD49e (VLA-5), class II MHC, CD13, and CD23, whereas it decreased the expression of CD64, CD32, CD16, and CD14 in a dose-dependent manner. IL-13 induced up-regulation of class II MHC Ag and its down-regulatory effects on CD64, CD32, and CD16 expression were prevented by IL-10. IFN-gamma could also partially prevent the IL-13-induced down-regulation of CD64, but not that of CD32 and CD16. However, IL-13 strongly inhibited spontaneous and IL-10- or IFN-gamma-induced ADCC activity of human monocytes toward anti-D coated Rh+ erythrocytes, indicating that the cytotoxic activity of monocytes was inhibited. Furthermore, IL-13 inhibited production of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 p35, IL-12 p40, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, granulocyte/macrophage-CSF, granulocyte-CSF, IFN-alpha, and TNF alpha by monocytes activated with LPS. In contrast, IL-13 enhanced the production of IL-1 ra by these cells. Similar results on cytokine production were observed or have been obtained with IL-4. Thus IL-13 shares most of its activities on human monocytes with IL-4, but no additive or synergistic effects of IL-4 and IL-13 on human monocytes were observed, suggesting that these cytokines may share common receptor components.

We have examined the association of the pleiotropic cytokine TNF-alpha with glycoprotein constituents of ECM. TNF-alpha interacted with fibronectin (FN) and laminin, and to a lesser degree with collagen. The major binding site for TNF-alpha on FN was localized to its 30-kDa N-terminal fragment (FN-N') with a Ki in the sub-nM range. The binding of 125I-labeled TNF-alpha to immobilized FN or FN-N' persisted for at least 24 h, and was specifically inhibited by antibodies to FN, mAb directed against the FN-N' domain, unlabeled TNF-alpha, and by the truncated forms of TNF-alpha receptors. Once bound to immobilized FN or FN-N', the cytokine could not be released by the soluble TNF-alpha-receptors, although it could be released by anti-TNF-alpha Ab. TNF-alpha was also found to interact with soluble FN, although with a lower affinity. Similar to the soluble cytokine, the FN-bound TNF-alpha appears to be functional; it augmented the beta 1-integrin-mediated adhesiveness of activated CD4+ human T cells to the glycoprotein. Hence, binding of TNF-alpha to immobilized FN, which modifies its functional accessibility to soluble TNF-alpha receptors, does not abolish but rather may locally restrict its activity.

The present study investigated the activation pathway of human peripheral blood-derived immature NK cells by IL-12 and its comparison to activation by interleukin-2 (IL-2). Immature NK cells were prepared by flow cytometry cell sorting techniques whereby the nonbinding Free NK subset was separated from the NK target conjugate subpopulation. Coculture of Free cells with IL-12 overnight resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity and recruitment of cytotoxic Killer cells. The IL-12-mediated activation of cytotoxicity was dependent on endogenous TNF-alpha secretion and was suppressed by endogenous (interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion. However, IL-2-mediated activation was inhibited by anti-TNF-alpha antibody, but was not affected by endogenous IFN-gamma secretion. There was an upregulation of the expression of CD69 and CD25 surface antigens by IL-12-treated cells and this upregulation was diminished in the presence of anti-TNF-alpha antibody. IL-12 also upregulated the expression of the 75-kDa TNF receptor (TNF-R p75) and the upregulation was inhibited by anti-IFN-gamma antibody. The 55-kDa TNF receptor (TNF-R p55), however, was not affected by IL-12, but in the presence of anti-IFN-gamma antibody, its expression was enhanced. Thus, these results suggest that IFN-gamma selectively upregulates the expression of TNF-R p75 by IL-12 but inhibits the expression of TNF-R p55 by IL-12. Unlike IL-2, IL-12, does not stimulate the proliferation of Free cells. Furthermore, unlike IL-2, IL-12 does not stimulate the secretion of TNF-alpha by Free cells, but significantly stimulates IFN-gamma secretion. These findings demonstrate that IL-12 share some, but not all, properties of IL-2 in the activation pathway of immature NK Free cells.

However, on 24-hr pulsed co-exposure to vomitoxin and the mitogen concanavalin A (ConA), CD4+/CD8+ cells were capable of inducing a three- to five-fold increase in production of IgA, but not IgG and IgM by cocultured B cells when compared with B cells cocultured with control T cells exposed to the mitogen only. When pulsed for 48 hr with ConA and toxin, CD4+ cells were similarly capable of causing a significant increase in IgA production by B cells. 48-hr pulsed exposure of CD4+ cells to ConA and vomitoxin resulted in significantly increased production of the T helper cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6 after 5 additional days of culture, compared with ConA-stimulated CD4+ cells alone. These results suggest that vomitoxin was capable of enhancing CD4(+)-mediated help for IgA production by B cells and that this could possibly be mediated by way of increased cytokine production.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "R L", "last_name": "Warner", "initials": "RL", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Food Science & Human Nutrition, Michigan State University, East Lansing 48824."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "K", "last_name": "Brooks", "initials": "K", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J J", "last_name": "Pestka", "initials": "JJ", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association", "issn": ["0278-6915"], "volume": "32", "issue": "7", "pub_year": "1994", "pub_month": "Jul", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "7914487", "doi": "10.1111/j.1432-1033.1994.tb19033.x", "title": "Protease-catalyzed conversion of insulin-like growth factor-1 and interleukin-6 into high-molecular-mass species through the sequential action of hematopoietic surface-associated cathepsin G and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-related activities.", "abstract": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and insulin-like growth-factor-1 (IGF-1) are cytokines produced by a variety of cells that act on a wide range of tissues, influencing cell growth and differentiation. Purified plasma membranes from human U937 monoblastic cells produced in vitro dimeric species of IL-6- and IGF-1-derived peptides through the sequential actions of surface-associated enzymes cathepsin G and transpeptidase activities. Cathepsin G degraded native unglycosylated IL-6 and IGF-1 molecules into 8-kDa and 7-kDa peptides respectively. Subsequent dimerisation of these intermediate forms into 16-kDa IL-6- and 14-kDa IGF-1-derived peptides was inhibited by acivicin and glutathione which are specific inhibitors of the standard cell-surface gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT). However U937 plasma membranes, cleared of gamma-GT activity by immunoprecipitation with anti-gamma-GT and adsorption on protein-G-Sepharose, were still able to convert the intermediate forms of IL-6 and IGF-1 into dimers. Together, these observations indicate that the transpeptidase involved in the formation of the dimeric species of IL-6 and IGF-1 was related to, but distinct from, standard cell-surface gamma-GT. Cells of all hematopoietic lineages expressed gamma-GT-related activity. In contrast to the 16-kDa IL-6-derived peptide that did not retain growth-stimulating activity, the 14-kDa IGF-1 peptide was at least equipotent with native IGF-1 in the BALB/c 3T3 fibroblast DNA synthesis response. The N/O-glycosylated IL-6 was clearly as sensitive to cathepsin-G- and gamma-GT-related activities as the unglycosylated IL-6 from Escherichia coli, thus indicating that the sugar chains did not protect the cleavage sites of the two proteases on the IL-6 molecule.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha itself suppressed endotoxin-evoked tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA expression when given in a narrow time interval with lipopolysaccharide. Interleukin-10 of human or mouse origin also inhibited the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA and protein when given more than 2 h prior to the endotoxin challenge.

Production and release of cytokines by activated mononuclear phagocytes is an important event in the pathogenesis of ischemia-reperfusion injury, a pathologic phenomenon that is associated with excessive ATP catabolism and subsequent local release of adenosine. The \"retaliatory\" metabolite adenosine has been shown to interfere with PMN function, thereby attenuating the deleterious consequences of ischemia and reperfusion. In this study, we demonstrate that adenosine inhibits the production of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 by LPS-activated human monocytes with a differential potency. The A2 receptor-specific adenosine analogues 2-chloroadenosine and 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) were most effective in attenuating LPS-induced cytokine production, whereas the A1-selective adenosine analogue N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) was less effective, indicating that inhibition of cytokine production by adenosine is primarily an A2 receptor-mediated event. The observed inhibitory effects were not restricted to endotoxin-induced cytokine production, because adenosine also inhibited TNF-alpha production by monocytes stimulated with the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta. Again, 2-chloroadenosine and NECA reduced IL-beta-induced TNF-alpha production more potently than CPA. In contrast, adenosine enhanced production of IL-6 and IL-8 by monocytes stimulated with IL-1 beta. Furthermore, only 2-chloroadenosine, but not NECA, strongly inhibited cytokine-induced IL-6 and IL-8 production.

This growth factor induces human macrophages to migrate and proliferate, improves their accessory function and increases the expression of HLA-DR antigens on macrophages and macrophage-like synoviocytes. METHODS: GM-CSF was assayed by ELISA and a bioassay in cell and organ culture supernatants from human articular chondrocytes, by in situ hybridization, Northern blot analysis and affinity chromatography. RESULTS: Both interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) synergistically or additively stimulated chondrocytes to produce significant amounts of immunoreactive and bioactive GM-CSF with maximum values of 2928 pg/ml (p < 0.0001 both for IL-1 and/or TNF-alpha vs baseline). Affinity chromatography using specific monoclonal antibodies for human GM-CSF resulted in the purification of a chondrocyte derived 22-23 kDa protein. In situ hybridization demonstrated that the number of chondrocytes that expressed GM-CSF mRNA correlated well to the amount of GM-CSF secreted into the cultures. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and to a lesser extent interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were able to decrease GM-CSF production induced by IL-1 and/or TNF-alpha. In contrast, basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) in combination with IL-1 strongly increased GM-CSF secretion up to 8.5-fold. IFN-gamma, IL-6, TGF-beta, bFGF and IL-8 given alone failed to induce chondrocytes to produce GM-CSF. Steroids and low concentrations of cyclooxygenase inhibitors in general suppressed cytokine induced GM-CSF production. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that both proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF-alpha induce an immunoreactive and biologically active GM-CSF by human articular chondrocytes that appears to be downregulated by TGF-beta and upregulated by FGF.

This model of bone resorption does not require the generation of osteoclasts in order to elicit a resorptive response and allowed us to assess whether IL-6 can directly affect osteoclastic bone resorption. We confirmed previous studies which showed that exogenous recombinant murine or human IL-6 does not stimulate bone resorption and demonstrated that IL-6, when added prior to the addition of parathyroid hormone, caused a significant but somewhat variable inhibition at 120 hours. Exogenous PGE2 stimulated both IL-6 production and resorption in FRLB cultures in a concentration-dependent manner. Endogenous production of IL-6 in fetal rat long bone (FRLB) cultures was stimulus dependent and generally correlated with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in the same cultures. However, endogenous IL-6 production did not correlate with the extent of bone resorption, except when IL-1 and PGE2 were used as stimuli. Addition of indomethacin and diclofenac to IL-1 stimulated cultures demonstrated that both the IL-6 production and bone resorption were largely PGE-2 dependent.

The presence of IFN-gamma in the first half of the culture period dramatically suppressed the production of IgG1, whereas spontaneous IgG2 secretion was sharply enhanced by IFN-gamma when the latter was present throughout the culture period. Endogenous IFN-gamma was shown to be effective in IgG1 and IgG2 production because IgG1 production was enhanced and IgG2 production was inhibited by the addition of anti-IFN-gamma Ab. Because IFN-gamma did not act on the PBMC depleted of surface IgG2-bearing cells to enhance IgG2, IFN-gamma is unlikely to act as a switching factor. Differing from IFN-gamma, IL-6 enhanced every IgG subclass production as a nonswitching factor, although each of IgG subclasses required IL-6 differentially; maximal IgG1 responses and IgG4 responses occurred when IL-6 was present for the entire culture period or the last half of the culture period, whereas maximal IgG3 responses required the presence of IL-6 for the entire culture period and maximal IgG2 responses were seen when IL-6 was present solely during the last half of the culture period.

It is produced by both the hypothalamus and the pituitary, and it induces the secretion of anterior pituitary hormones. Because of the regulatory role of IL-6 in tumor growth and its involvement in the pituitary, we decided to evaluate IL-6 and IL-6 receptor expression in pituitary tumors.

Our results show that the IL-6 gene is expressed in the normal pituitary tissue. However, the non-functioning and functioning pituitary tumors such as the prolactin and growth hormone secreting tumors express increased levels of the IL-6 gene.

Unlike PPD GR, SEA bead lesions contained eosinophils, whereas CON beads elicited only a limited mononuclear infiltrate. GRs and draining lymph nodes (LN) were assessed on days 2, 4, and 8 for Th1-(interleukin-2 [IL-2], interferon-gamma[IFN] and Th2-type (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) cytokines.

In contrast, both PPD and SEA antigen-coated beads induced reactive lymphoid hyperplasia but differed greatly in local and regional cytokine profiles. PPD GR produced IFN-gamma on day 2 and the draining LN produced predominantly Th1 cytokines on days 2 and 4. In contrast, SEA beads GRs were dominated by Th2 cytokines. The corresponding LN produced IL-2 and IL-4 on day 2; IL-2, IL-4, IFN-gamma, and IL-10 on day 4; then IL-2, IFN-gamma, and IL-4 on day 8, probably reflecting maturational changes of T cells.

Compared with CON GR, MPs from PPD GR were weak sources of IL-6, whereas those of SEA GR showed enhanced and accelerated production. In contrast, MP of PPD GR had augmented TNF-producing capacity, whereas those of SEA GR showed delayed TNF production. In vivo depletion of TNF, respectively, caused 40 and 10% decreases in PPD GR and SEA GR but had no effect on CON GR area, indicating that TNF contributed to a greater degree to the PPD response.

DESIGN: A rat intestinal crypt cell line, IEC-6, was cultured in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 0.1 to 1.0 microgram/mL, and/or PGE2, 1 mumol/L. In other experiments, indomethacin, 20 mumol/L, was added to LPS-treated cells to block the effects of prostaglandins. Control wells contained medium alone. Levels of IL-6 were determined by the B9 murine hybridoma bioassay. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on RNA from control and LPS-treated cells to examine IL-6 message. RESULTS: Lipopolysaccharide and PGE2 induced IL-6 release from IEC-6 cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, and the substances interacted synergistically. Addition of indomethacin blunted the effect of endotoxin on IL-6 production, consistent with a stimulatory role of PGE2.

We demonstrate that secretion of IL-6 is induced by cAMP in murine monocytic PU5-1.8 cells, even though to a lesser extent than by LPS. Nevertheless, cAMP and prostaglandins of the E series in the presence of theophylline induce transcription of the IL-6 promoter more strongly than LPS, suggesting distinctive effects of cAMP and LPS on posttranscriptional events. Mutations within four regulatory elements, namely, the multiple response element (MRE), AP-1, NF-IL6, and NF-kappa B sites, significantly reduce, but do not completely abrogate, inducibility by cAMP and prostaglandin E1, whereas alterations of four additional sites have no effects. LPS-induced promoter activity, however, is almost completely abolished by mutations in the NF-kappa B site, suggesting that a single regulatory element is crucial for inducibility by LPS. Stimulation by cAMP is correlated with the binding of inducible factors to the AP-1, NF-IL6, and NF-kappa B elements, whereas factors binding to the MRE are constitutively expressed. Recombinant cAMP response element-binding protein binds to the MRE, indicating a potential role for this factor in the cAMP response.

Proliferative or growth suppressive effects of the cytokines were assessed by quantitative analysis of the DNA in the cell culture wells. Macrophage-derived cytokines IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and TNF significantly suppressed cell growth; this was associated with a significant increase in EGF receptor expression.

By reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction, low levels of EGF mRNA were detected in all three cell lines.

All three cytokines were induced by LPS alone. With 30 mg/ml Sandoglobulin alone, IL-1 beta production changed little from control, whilst IL-6 production increased markedly in CSL-serum only. TNF-alpha production increased slightly in BM-plasma and CSL-plasma, but not in CSL-serum. Lower concentrations of Sandoglobulin did not affect cytokine production. Upon stimulation with LPS/Sandoglobulin immune complexes, a trend in cytokine production was seen compared with the response to LPS alone: IL-1 beta and IL-6 production increased, whilst TNF-alpha production decreased. This only occurred in CSL-plasma and CSL-serum. Complement activation was present only in CSL-plasma and CSL-serum. Thus in the presence of complement activation and/or serum, Sandoglobulin can induce IL-6 production whilst suppressing the small TNF-alpha response it otherwise stimulates. In addition, when LPS is presented in the form of IgG immune complexes, dissociation of IL-1 beta and IL-6 production from TNF-alpha production is seen but only in the presence of complement activation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "S M", "last_name": "Yentis", "initials": "SM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Anaesthesia, Chelsea & Westminster Hospital, London, UK."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "R P", "last_name": "Gooding", "initials": "RP", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "P G", "last_name": "Riches", "initials": "PG", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Cytokine", "issn": ["1043-4666"], "volume": "6", "issue": "3", "pub_year": "1994", "pub_month": "May", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8054487", "doi": "10.1016/1043-4666(94)90027-2", "title": "Leukaemia inhibitory factor and interleukin 6 are expressed at very low levels in the normal adult mouse and are induced by inflammation.", "abstract": "We have assessed the limitations of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a semiquantitative technique for assessing very low level gene expression.

Interferon gamma (IFN gamma), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) did not induce IL6 mRNA production; however, IL6 mRNA expression and protein production was strongly induced by IL1 alpha and to a lesser extent by IFN alpha. The IL6 mRNA expression induced by IL1 alpha was potentiated by TGF-beta 1 and IFN alpha and slightly decreased by IFN gamma. The potentiation of cytokine mRNA accumulation by TGF-beta 1 was both time- and concentration-dependent. Induction of IL6 mRNA by IL1 alpha was optimally potentiated either if U373-MG cells were pretreated with TGF-beta 1 or if TGF-beta 1 was added within 30 min after stimulation with IL1 alpha. The potentiation of IL6 mRNA by TGF-beta 1 required de novo synthesis of an intermediate protein since treatment with cycloheximide abrogated the amount of mRNA enhanced by TGF-beta 1 without affecting IL1 alpha-driven mRNA production. Nuclear run-on analyses demonstrated increased transcriptional activity of the IL6 gene when stimulated with IL1 alpha in the presence of TGF-beta 1. However, actinomycin-D pulse chase experiments showed that TGF-beta 1 did not increase the stability of IL6 mRNA. Thus, in concert, the results demonstrate that TGF-beta 1 potentiates IL6 production in astrocytoma cells by promoting the transcriptional activity of the IL6 gene and requires coexpression of new proteins.

Since Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is one of the activating factors of PMN, we have examined its effect on PMN-derived cytokine production. Recently, we demonstrated that IFN-gamma inhibits the release of IL-8 by PMN stimulated for 2 with different agonists. In this report, we show that the IFN-gamma-dependent inhibition of IL-8 release by PMN stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and/or interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), but not with Y-IgG, is a transient phenomenon. Indeed, PMN stimulated in the presence of IFN-gamma for 18 hr demonstrated an enhanced expression of IL-8 antigen in cell-free supernatants compared with stimuli alone. This enhanced accumulation of IL-8 partially reflected changes at the level of cell-associated versus cell-secreted IL-8 as PMN incubated with IFN-gamma secreted significantly more IL-8, relative to untreated cells. Unlike IL-8, the LPS-stimulated production of TNF and IL-1 beta, as well as the TNF-stimulated production of IL-1 beta, was markedly enhanced by IFN-gamma over the entire incubation period (up to 18 hr). Addition of anti-TNF and anti-IL-1 beta antibodies to IFN-gamma plus LPS-treated PMN indicated that the LPS-induced production of endogenous TNF and IL-1 beta, which was further potentiated by IFN-gamma pretreatment, mediated in autocrine fashion the enhanced LPS-induced IL-8 accumulation observed at 18 hr. Furthermore, as shown by Northern blot analysis, all the effects of IFN-gamma on LPS-stimulated PMN were paralleled by changes at the level of TNF, IL-1 beta, and IL-8 mRNA expression.

Here we describe a novel, highly specific, mAb against monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). The 5D3-F7 mAb (IgG1,kappa) recognizes human recombinant and natural MCP-1 in ELISA, immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. As a source of natural MCP-1 we used the 8387 human sarcoma line which produces spontaneously MCP-1 and responds to TNF with increased expression and release. The 5D3-F7 mAb inhibited the chemotactic activity of MCP-1 for monocytes. Using the 5D3-F7 mAb and a polyclonal rabbit anti-MCP-1 serum, a sandwich ELISA was developed. In both the direct and the sandwich ELISA, the 5D3-F7 mAb recognized human MCP-1, but not the closely related C-C chemokines MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MIP-1 alpha, and RANTES and the C-X-C chemokines IL-8, gro alpha and NAP-2.

The LMP1 and EBNA2 genes were transiently expressed from heterologous promoters in two human T-cell lines (HPB-ALL and Jurkat), two human cell lines of the myeloid lineage (K562 and U937), one type I Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Rael) and in human primary T cells and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. The cell surface expression of CD23, CD21, ICAM-1 and LFA-1 was monitored on transfected cells. In the cell lines, except U937, the surface antigens CD21 and ICAM-1 were upregulated in a dose-dependent and transient manner by the transient expression of LMP1, and EBNA2 slightly enhanced the effects of LMP1 on CD23 and CD21 upregulation. LMP1 also induced increased CD21, ICAM-1 and LFA-1 surface expression on transfected primary T-cells, and CD21 and ICAM-1 in four of five B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias tested. Finally, LMP1 transient expression caused increased cell size of the primary T cells and responding B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.

After stimulation naive cells produce only IL-2, whereas memory cells produce several cytokines including IFN-gamma and IL-4. Using umbilical cord blood-derived CD4 T cells as a source of naive T cells, we first report that these cells are capable of producing large amounts of IFN-gamma when cultured with low concentrations of IL-12. The response is time- and dose-dependent, and it is observed at the protein and mRNA levels. IL-12 also induces neonatal CD4 T cells to produce lymphotoxin but not IL-2, TNF-alpha, or IL-4. The production of IFN-gamma by IL-12-stimulated neonatal T cells is associated with a small but significant T cell activation evidenced by DNA synthesis and by the expression of the activation markers CD25, CD71, and HLA-DR; moreover, it is inhibited by hydrocortisone, cyclosporin A, and transforming growth factor-beta. The response to IL-12 is enhanced and is much more rapid when CD4 T cells are cultured in the presence of accessory cells or of exogenous IL-1, IL-2, or TNF-alpha. Using a three-step culture system, we next show that IL-12 induces the maturation of resting naive CD4 T cells into cells producing both IL-2 and IFN-gamma but not IL-4 upon stimulation with PMA and ionomycin. Endogenously produced IFN-gamma plays a role in this IL-12-induced T cell maturation, as shown by the inhibitory effect of neutralizing IFN-gamma antibodies. Finally, we show that IL-12 supports the production of IFN-gamma during primary stimulation of neonatal T cells via the CD3/TCR complex by means of either immobilized anti-CD3 mAb or superantigen-coated (Staphylococcus enterotoxin B) fixed L cell transfectants expressing HLA-DR.

Exposure of serum-stimulated cells to IL-1 beta and IL-6 for 48 hours resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of both mitogenesis, determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation, and proliferation, determined by absolute cell counts.

The naturally occurring interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) and passive immunization with anti-IL-6 antiserum were used to study the in vivo mechanism of action of IL-1 on Fg gene expression. Changes in plasma Fg and hepatic Fg mRNA concentrations were measured following administration of exogenous IL-1ra together with IL-6 or IL-1 to CD2F1 mice. Our results suggest that in vivo, IL-1 per se inhibits Fg production since when IL-1ra was co-administered with IL-6, greater concentrations of Fg were observed than when IL-6 was administered alone. The data suggest that IL-1 stimulates Fg production through intermediate production of IL-6, since stimulation was abrogated when either IL-1ra or anti-IL-6 antiserum was co-administered with IL-1. An in vivo role for IL-1ra in the stimulation of Fg by IL-1 was supported by the observation that within 1 h of IL-1 administration to mice, IL-1ra mRNA was detectable in liver. It appears that IL-1, an early mediator of inflammation, inhibits constitutive expression of Fg genes and stimulates the IL-1ra and IL-6 genes.

The relaxant effects of interleukin-1 beta and TNF were not influenced by the inhibition of cyclooxygenase or nitric oxide-synthase activities. Interleukin-1 beta- and TNF-induced gastric relaxations were concentration dependently inhibited by BW 755c, which inhibits both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase, BW A4, which selectively inhibits the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, and SC 41930, a selective leukotriene B4 receptor antagonist, providing pharmacological evidence that leukotriene B4 is involved in the relaxant effects of both cytokines. The interleukin-1 beta- and TNF-induced activation of 5-lipoxygenase pathway did not appear to be triggered by phospholipase A2. An alternative pathway could involve the following steps: (i) activation of phospholipase C and the formation of diacylglycerol; (ii) diacylglycerol-induced activation of protein kinase C; (iii) formation of free arachidonic acid from diacylglycerol by diacylglycerol-lipase. This mechanism is suggested by the finding that leukotriene B4 is able to mimic cytokine-induced strip relaxation only in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which selectively activates protein kinase C.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "P", "last_name": "Montuschi", "initials": "P", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Institute of Pharmacology, Catholic University School of Medicine, Rome, Italy."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "G", "last_name": "Tringali", "initials": "G", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "D", "last_name": "Curr\u00f2", "initials": "D", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "G", "last_name": "Ciabattoni", "initials": "G", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "L", "last_name": "Parente", "initials": "L", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "P", "last_name": "Preziosi", "initials": "P", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "P", "last_name": "Navarra", "initials": "P", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "European journal of pharmacology", "issn": ["0014-2999"], "volume": "252", "issue": "3", "pub_year": "1994", "pub_month": "Feb", "pub_day": "11"}}, {"pmid": "8167153", "doi": "10.1016/0167-4889(94)90255-0", "title": "Regulation of plasminogen activation by interleukin-6 in human lung fibroblasts.", "abstract": "We determined that exposure of cultured lung fibroblasts (HEL-299) to recombinant human interleukin-6 (0-400 ng/ml) resulted in a dose- and time-dependent increase in secreted and cell lysate PAI-1 and total tPA levels (maximal increase of 2.6-fold and 1.7-fold, respectively).

Treatment of the U1 cell line by L-2-oxo-4-thiazolidine carboxylic acid (OTC), which is converted to cysteine by 5-oxoprolinase, or by homocysteine (HC), a natural cysteine precursor, reduced the PMA-induced HIV expression, but surprisingly, markedly stimulated the expression mediated by IL-6 and GM-CSF. Several experiments to investigate the effect of OTC on LTR transactivation were carried out, but beta-galactosidase activity was never modified in a significant fashion in PMA-induced Jurkat T-cells after OTC treatment. Furthermore, HC stimulated the PMA-mediated HIV-LTR transactivation in Jurkat T-cells. GSH assays showed that treatment of U937 and Jurkat T-cells with NAC and OTC moderately increased the GSH level, while HC led to a significantly higher increase of the thiol level.

We have investigated the mechanism of interaction between the secosteroid 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] and the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) by measuring their effects on two 1,25-(OH)2D3 responsive matrix protein genes, osteocalcin (OC) and osteopontin (OP). Our previous studies revealed that an inhibitory effect of TNF-alpha on 1,25-(OH)2D3-stimulated OC gene transcription is conferred by the same 25 base pair region of 5'-flanking DNA that confers a response to vitamin D (VDRE). Gel mobility shift studies of [32P]VDRE binding to ROS 17/2.8 cell nuclear extract revealed that TNF-alpha inhibits 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulated formation of specific retinoid X receptor/vitamin D receptor (RXR/VDR)-DNA complexes in vitro. To determine if TNF-alpha was inhibiting nuclear protein-VDRE binding by modulation of VDR availability, we measured intranuclear VDR in cells treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10(-8) M), TNF-alpha (100 ng/ml), or both, by western blot. 1,25-(OH)2D3 caused upregulation of the nuclear VDR. Treatment with TNF-alpha inhibited the 1,25-(OH)2D3-stimulated up-regulation of VDR nuclear protein content. However, down-regulation of VDR was unlikely to be the mechanism of TNF-alpha action because TNF-alpha had no effect on 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulation of steady state OP messenger RNA or transcription of an OP-VDRE-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter construct. These results suggest that decreased VDR alone does not explain the mechanism of TNF-alpha action. VDRE structural requirements for TNF-alpha action were characterized by comparing binding of mutant and hybrid forms of mouse (m)OP-, rat (r)OC-, and human (h)OC-VDRE probes to nuclear protein from cells treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 and/or TNF-alpha. These homologous vitamin D response elements differ in that an AP-1 sequence is included in the rOC-VDRE and hOC-VDRE but not in the OP-VDRE. Gel mobility shift analysis revealed that TNF-alpha inhibited 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulation of nuclear protein binding to rOC-VDRE and hOC-VDRE to 59% and 69% of control, respectively, but had no effect on 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulation of nuclear protein binding to OP-VDRE. The effect of TNF-alpha could not be conferred in a mutant OP-VDRE in which the rOC-VDRE AP-1 sequence was inserted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "H", "last_name": "Kuno", "initials": "H", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30033."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S M", "last_name": "Kurian", "initials": "SM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "G N", "last_name": "Hendy", "initials": "GN", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J", "last_name": "White", "initials": "J", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "H F", "last_name": "deLuca", "initials": "HF", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "C O", "last_name": "Evans", "initials": "CO", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M S", "last_name": "Nanes", "initials": "MS", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Endocrinology", "issn": ["0013-7227"], "volume": "134", "issue": "6", "pub_year": "1994", "pub_month": "Jun", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8195587", "doi": "10.1016/0022-1759(94)90036-1", "title": "Determination of haptoglobin expression in IL-6 treated HepG2 cells by ELISA and by RNA hybridization--evaluation of a quantitative method to measure IL-6.", "abstract": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is known to be an important modulator of acute phase (AP) protein expression in hepatocytes both in vivo and in vitro.

A dose-response relationship from 0.3 to 4.8 ng/ml of a human recombinant IL-6 preparation derived from a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line was observed after 48 h of treatment. Comparable results were obtained by analysing both HP mRNA expression and HP protein secretion. Detectable induction of HP protein secretion was observed with as little as 25 pg/ml of IL-6. The effect of IL-6 was potentiated by dexamethasone, while an inhibition on HP mRNA inducibility could be prevented by lowering the foetal calf serum (FCS) concentration to 1%. Preliminary data indicate that neither IL-1 beta nor TNF-alpha were able to induce significantly HP mRNA expression and protein secretion. The activity ratio between two IL-6 preparations (from CHO and E. coli cells) obtained with a conventional IL-6 bioassay (i.e., T1165 cell growth assay) was comparable to that obtained in the induction of HP expression.

Prompted by this evidence, we have now examined whether TNF and/or IL-1 are produced by murine calvarial cells, and whether these cytokines are involved in IL-6 production and osteoclast formation. When cultured under basal conditions, calvarial cells produced TNF and IL-6, and were able to form bone resorbing osteoclasts. A neutralizing antibody against TNF suppressed both basal IL-6 production and the formation of bone resorbing osteoclasts. The anti-TNF antibody also inhibited IL-6 production in response to exogenous IL-1 or parathyroid hormone (PTH). In contrast, a neutralizing anti-IL-1 receptor antibody had no effect on basal, TNF- or PTH-stimulated IL-6 production. These findings suggest that TNF, but not IL-1, is produced by murine bone cells and that endogenous TNF induces the IL-6 production, osteoclast formation, and bone resorption exhibited by these cultures under basal conditions.

We studied the interaction of IL-6 with the Ca2+ and cAMP signaling systems in the osteoblastic cell line UMR-106 and in primary osteoblastic cultures derived from neonatal rat calvariae. IL-6 did not alter basal intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) but inhibited Ca2+ transients induced by parathyroid hormone (PTH), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and endothelin-1 in both dose- (100-400 U/ml) and time- (4-48 h) dependent manners. The effect of the cytokine was abolished by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A (50 ng/ml). The IL-6 effect on the Ca2+ message system was related to suppressed production of hormonally induced inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and inhibition of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Hormonally induced calcium entry pathways (estimated by using Mn2+ as a surrogate for Ca2+) were not, however, altered by the cytokine. IL-6 did not modulate cAMP generation in osteoblasts. With respect to osteoblast function, IL-6, although having no effect on cell proliferation by itself, greatly enhanced the antiproliferative effect of PGE2 and PTH.

Vasoactive intestinal peptide strongly increased, in a dose-dependent manner, interleukin 6 production. This effect was reduced when protein kinase A was blocked by KT-5720; it was not affected by calphostin C, a protein kinase C inhibitor. Forskolin caused a concentration-dependent increase in interleukin 6 release that was also inhibited by KT-5720. Because prostaglandins are believed to play a role in interleukin 6 production, we tried to determine whether the stimulatory effects of vasoactive intestinal peptide and forskolin on cytokine release might be mediated by stimulation of prostaglandin production in cortical astrocytes. Vasoactive intestinal peptide did not increase the production of either prostaglandin E2 or F2 alpha. Conversely, forskolin concentration-dependently stimulated the production of both prostaglandins, an effect that was blocked by indomethacin. Indomethacin did not affect either vasoactive intestinal peptide- or forskolin-stimulated interleukin 6 production. To exclude the possibility that prostaglandins participate in interleukin 6 production induced by forskolin, we tested prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha. The former was completely ineffective in eliciting the cytokine production, whereas prostaglandin F2 alpha slightly increased interleukin 6 production only at the highest concentrations. 8-Bromo-cAMP and dibutyryl-cAMP stimulated interleukin 6 production to a lesser extent than vasoactive intestinal peptide and forskolin. In conclusion, we provide evidence that vasoactive intestinal peptide increases interleukin 6 production by astrocytes through the stimulation of the cAMP-protein kinase A pathway, an effect that is reproduced by cAMP analogues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Grimaldi", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Dipartimento di Scienza delle Communicazioni Umane, Facolt\u00e0 di Medicina e Chirurgia, Universit\u00e0 di Napoli Federico II, Italy."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "G", "last_name": "Pozzoli", "initials": "G", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "P", "last_name": "Navarra", "initials": "P", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "P", "last_name": "Preziosi", "initials": "P", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "G", "last_name": "Schettini", "initials": "G", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Journal of neurochemistry", "issn": ["0022-3042"], "volume": "63", "issue": "1", "pub_year": "1994", "pub_month": "Jul", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8210710", "doi": "10.1016/s0923-2516(06)80042-7", "title": "Early steps in fusion between Epstein-Barr virus and a human hepatoma cell line (Li7A).", "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus, the causative agent of mononucleosis and several human cancers, infects cells via complement receptor type 2 (CR2).

Although IFN-gamma induced IL-6 gene transcription in both alloAP+ and alloAP- M theta subsets, it induced IL-1 alpha transcripts only in the alloAP+ subset. Finally, CD8+ T cells exposed to alloAP- M theta were unresponsive when subsequently cultured with alloAP+ M theta. We conclude that the ability of some M theta to elicit IFN-gamma from CD8+ T cells and to respond to this cytokine by producing IL-1 alpha defines the alloAP phenotype of the cell population, and that alloAP- M theta induce a state of alloantigen-specific tolerance in naive CD8+ T cells.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "J M", "last_name": "McCormack", "initials": "JM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis TN 38105."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "D", "last_name": "Askew", "initials": "D", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "W S", "last_name": "Walker", "initials": "WS", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "issn": ["0022-1767"], "volume": "151", "issue": "10", "pub_year": "1993", "pub_month": "Nov", "pub_day": "15"}}, {"pmid": "8228249", "doi": null, "title": "Tissue-specific regulation of IL-6 production by IL-4.

Although monocytes are a major source of IL-6, other cell types such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells can also express this cytokine. To determine whether IL-4 inhibits IL-6 expression in non-hemopoietic cells, we investigated the effects of IL-4 on IL-6 production in both primary human fibroblasts and fibroblast lines. Rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts were evaluated in these studies because, like monocytes, they produce high levels of IL-6 when stimulated with IL-1. Although peripheral blood monocytes did not constitutively express IL-6 mRNA or protein, stimulation with IL-1 or LPS induced de novo IL-6 expression in these cells. In contrast, synovial fibroblasts displayed a significant basal level of IL-6 production, which was markedly increased after stimulation with IL-1. IL-4 suppressed IL-6 expression in monocytes, but did not inhibit IL-6 production in synovial fibroblasts. The inability of IL-4 to suppress IL-6 synthesis in rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts was not caused by a lack of IL-4R and was not unique to these cells because IL-4 also failed to inhibit IL-6 production in normal fibroblast lines derived from other tissues. Inhibition of IL-6 production by IL-4 in monocytes was associated with decreased nuclear NF-kappa B levels. However, IL-4 does not globally suppress the activity of all DNA-binding proteins because IL-4 treatment did not reduce the levels of NF-IL-6 or NF-IL-1 beta B in the same cells. Because NF-kappa B activation is required for transcription of many cytokine genes, including IL-6, the ability of IL-4 to suppress NF-kappa B activity in monocytes suggests a potential mechanism by which this molecule may inhibit the expression of multiple cytokines.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "R P", "last_name": "Donnelly", "initials": "RP", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Division of Cytokine Biology, FDA, Bethesda, MD 20892."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "L J", "last_name": "Crofford", "initials": "LJ", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S L", "last_name": "Freeman", "initials": "SL", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J", "last_name": "Buras", "initials": "J", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "E", "last_name": "Remmers", "initials": "E", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "R L", "last_name": "Wilder", "initials": "RL", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M J", "last_name": "Fenton", "initials": "MJ", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "issn": ["0022-1767"], "volume": "151", "issue": "10", "pub_year": "1993", "pub_month": "Nov", "pub_day": "15"}}, {"pmid": "8240736", "doi": "10.1016/0952-7915(93)90130-k", "title": "Induction of B cell tumor dormancy by anti-idiotypic antibodies.", "abstract": "Long-term dormancy of murine B-cell lymphomas can be experimentally induced by immunizing the host with the idiotype expressed on the tumor.

In the studies described here, we have extended our observations using the anti-estrogen, tamoxifen, to demonstrate that in a steady state, endogenous intracellular concentrations of E2 have no effects on reductive 17-HSD activity (E1-->E2), but are already maximally inhibitory for the oxidative reaction (E2-->E1). Increasing intracellular concentrations of E2, however, stimulated the reductive 17-HSD in a dose-dependent manner. IL-6 stimulated the reductive pathway and was synergistic with E2. IL-6 is most likely acting through an E2-dependent mechanism, since tamoxifen completely reversed the effects of E2 and IL-6 separately and in combination.

Recombinant rat IL-1 beta (rIL-1 beta) when given ip resulted in dose-dependent increases in plasma ACTH, CORT, and IL-6 concentrations. Plasma ACTH and CORT responses could be induced by low rIL-1 beta doses that did not elevate plasma IL-6 levels. The half-maximally effective dose of rIL-1 beta was less than 0.6 microgram/kg for the ACTH and CORT responses and higher than 2.5 micrograms/kg for the IL-6 response. Time-course studies indicated that plasma ACTH and CORT concentrations were already elevated 30 min after the injection of rIL-1 beta (2.5 micrograms/kg, ip), with peak values after 1-2 h, followed by a subsequent decline. In contrast, plasma IL-6 concentrations became elevated 2 h after the injection of rIL-1 beta. In another set of experiments, the administration of endotoxin resulted in a dose-dependent elevation of the plasma ACTH, CORT, and IL-6 concentrations. The dose-response characteristics for ACTH, CORT, and IL-6 were different. The half-maximally effective dose for the ACTH and CORT, and IL-6 responses were approximately 2.5 micrograms/kg and more than 10 micrograms/kg, respectively. Time courses of plasma ACTH, CORT, and IL-6 responses to endotoxin (2.5 micrograms/kg, ip) were similar, with peak values measured after 2 h. When given alone, the human IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA; 1 or 2.5 mg/kg, ip) did not affect resting plasma ACTH and CORT concentrations and reduced plasma IL-6 concentrations in one experiment. At a dose of 1 mg/kg, IL-1RA inhibited ACTH and IL-6 responses to rIL-1 beta (2.5 micrograms/kg, ip) by 75% and 90%, respectively. Administration of IL-1RA (2.5 mg/kg, ip) 30 min after endotoxin (2.5 micrograms/kg, ip) completely prevented the ACTH response and partially inhibited the CORT response, but did not affect the IL-6 response measured 2.5 h after endotoxin administration. We conclude that 1) IL-1 receptors are involved in the ACTH and IL-6 responses to rat IL-1 beta; 2) the ACTH response, but not the IL-6 response, to a low dose dose of endotoxin in rats requires IL-1 receptor activation by endogenous produced IL-1; and 3) circulating IL-6 is not a prime mediator involved in ACTH and CORT responses to low doses of rIL-1 beta and endotoxin.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "K", "last_name": "Schotanus", "initials": "K", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Vrije Universiteit, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pharmacology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "F J", "last_name": "Tilders", "initials": "FJ", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "F", "last_name": "Berkenbosch", "initials": "F", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Endocrinology", "issn": ["0013-7227"], "volume": "133", "issue": "6", "pub_year": "1993", "pub_month": "Dec", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8245177", "doi": "10.1007/BF00920239", "title": "Regulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression: evidence for a tissue-specific role of protein kinase C.", "abstract": "The regulation of IL-6 mRNA expression was studied in human blood monocytes and in the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line HEp-2.

Furthermore, in monocytes, protein kinase C (PKC) activation by PMA even reduced IL-1-induced IL-6 mRNA, and IL-1-induced IL-6 synthesis was increased by the PKC inhibitor staurosporine.

These data indicate that IL-6 can be induced by a PKC-independent pathway in monocytes and HEp-2 cells. In monocytes PKC activation does not induce IL-6 and PMA interferes with the IL-1 effect. Transcription factors known to be involved with the regulation of IL-6 expression were studied by gel retardation assays.

Cytokine production by phagocytosing PMN was also inhibited by IL-10, but to a lesser extent than the LPS-induced production. As shown by Northern blot analysis, IL-10 diminished the levels of TNF, IL-1 beta, and IL-8 mRNAs late after the onset of stimulation of PMN with LPS. In addition, we provide evidence that the kinetics of LPS-induced IL-8 production by PMN is composed of two distinct phases. Specifically, our experiments demonstrated that in the first phase, the production of IL-8 is a process directly induced by LPS that lasts for some hours. After this early wave, a second phase begins that is sustained and leads to an elevated production of IL-8 that appears to be due to the endogenous release of TNF and IL-1 beta. This second wave can in fact be blocked by anti-TNF and anti-IL-1 beta neutralizing antibodies, and by IL-10 as the consequence of its downregulatory effects on TNF and IL-1 beta release.

Using the L929 bioassay, joint extracts from AA rats had significantly greater TNF levels (1054 +/- 147 pg/g tissue) than joint extracts from normal rats (110 +/- 42 pg/g tissue). Administration of ibuprofen failed to significantly inhibit TNF levels in the joint at a time point when paw swelling was significantly reduced. The immunomodulating agents, methotrexate, cyclosporin A (CSA) and HWA486 profoundly inhibited both joint TNF levels and paw swelling. The specificity of this assay for TNF was supported by studies with a polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse TNF antibody which neutralized 78-87% of the TNF activity in the joint extracts. Our studies demonstrate a quantitative increase in local TNF expression in adjuvant arthritis and support a role for TNF in chronic inflammation.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "T", "last_name": "Smith-Oliver", "initials": "T", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Cellular Biochemistry, Glaxo Inc., Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "L S", "last_name": "Noel", "initials": "LS", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S S", "last_name": "Stimpson", "initials": "SS", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "D P", "last_name": "Yarnall", "initials": "DP", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "K M", "last_name": "Connolly", "initials": "KM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Cytokine", "issn": ["1043-4666"], "volume": "5", "issue": "4", "pub_year": "1993", "pub_month": "Jul", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8260597", "doi": "10.1016/1043-4666(93)90063-b", "title": "The mouse C-reactive protein (CRP) gene is expressed in response to IL-1 but not IL-6.", "abstract": "C-Reactive protein (CRP) is a minor acute phase reactant (APR) in the mouse, whereas CRP is the prototypical and one of the major positive APRs in all other mammals.

The effect of TNF-alpha was observed in the cell preparations from which adherent cells had been removed, suggesting that cytokines secreted by adherent cells in response to TNF-alpha are not involved in the process. The enhancement of cAMP-induced DNA fragmentation was observed in CD4+CD(8+)-double positive cells, but not in CD4+CD(8-)-single positive cells.

With this exception there was no enhancement of bacterial killing for the range of combinations of neutrophils and bacterial species tested. In contrast, at the concentrations tested for effect on bactericidal activity, TNF-alpha and GM-CSF were able to significantly upregulate CR3 (but not Fc gamma RII) expression on mouse neutrophils.

It is because of these pleiotropic immunoregulatory effects that the detection of IL-10 in the supernatants of T cells, B cells, macrophages and other cells is important for many scientific questions. Here we describe a simple and sensitive bioassay specific for human IL-10 using the IL-10 dependent growth of the mouse mast cell line D36. Our data show that this assay is not crossreactive with hIL-1 beta, hIL-2, hIL-3, hIL-4, hIL-5, hIL-6, hIL-9, hIL-12, hGM-CSF and hTNF-alpha and that it can be completely blocked by an antibody against human IL-10. The hIL-10 induced growth of the D36 cell line is dependent on the presence of mIL-4. Human IL-10 can be measured in a concentration range from approximately 10 U/ml to 0.05 U/ml. This assay is only of limited use for the measurement of IL-10 in human blood samples since it is inhibited by the presence of human serum.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "J F", "last_name": "Schlaak", "initials": "JF", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["First Department of Medicine, University of Mainz, Germany."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "E", "last_name": "Schmitt", "initials": "E", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "C", "last_name": "H\u00fcls", "initials": "C", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "K H", "last_name": "Meyer zum B\u00fcschenfelde", "initials": "KH", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "B", "last_name": "Fleischer", "initials": "B", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Journal of immunological methods", "issn": ["0022-1759"], "volume": "168", "issue": "1", "pub_year": "1994", "pub_month": "Jan", "pub_day": "12"}}, {"pmid": "8289467", "doi": "10.1016/0145-2126(94)90009-4", "title": "Interleukin-4 (IL-4) inhibits proliferation and spontaneous cytokine release by chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cells.", "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that interleukin-4 (IL-4) may have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the growth of normal and malignant B-cells in vitro.

Coreceptors appear to serve to increase the sensitivity of both of these receptor systems through events that influence ligand binding and signal transduction. The critical role of tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream signaling components, such as phospholipase C, is the net result of changes in the balance of the action of antigen receptor-regulated PTKs and PTPases.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 alpha and interleukin-6 were rapidly secreted after in vivo LPS exposure or when added in vitro to rodent or human liver slice samples.

These inhibitory effects could not be explained by cytotoxicity or a shift in the kinetics of IL-6 production.

We found that treatment of the cultures with as little as 0.5 units/ml (1.5 pM) caused a detectable increase in both LIF message and protein as measured by Northern blot assay and ELISA, respectively. Furthermore, increasing concentrations of TNF alpha produced a dose-dependent increase in both steady-state LIF mRNA and protein levels up to a maximum response with 500 units/ml (1.5 nM). Increases in LIF mRNA levels were rapid and could be detected 1 hr after treatment with 500 units/ml of TNF alpha. However, this effect was transient.

In order to investigate this claim in relation to THP from normal adult urine we raised monoclonal antibodies to THP and sought THP/TNF-alpha interactions in three separate assay systems. We found no evidence that THP binds to TNF-alpha under physiological conditions, but we observed that it exerts a weak, probably not physiologically relevant, but reproducible inhibitory effect on the toxicity of TNF-alpha for monolayers of L929 cells, even when the cells are pretreated with the THP, and washed before addition of the cytokine. Since our preparations of THP do not interact directly with TNF-alpha we postulated an interaction with the cells themselves, or with their extracellular matrix. The THP was found by ELISA, immunoblotting and immunohistology, to bind to as yet unidentified components of the extracellular matrix in a manner dependent on cations, pH and carbohydrates.

To elucidate the activity of neuromediators on cytokine secretion by glial cells, we studied the secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) by cultured rat astrocytes after incubation with various neurotransmitters and neuropeptides.

To directly establish the link between estrogen loss and altered IL-6 production, implied by our earlier studies, we have now compared IL-6 production in ex vivo cultures of bone marrow cells from mice that were sham operated, ovariectomized, or ovariectomized and treated with 17 beta-estradiol. In addition, we have examined the effect of the in vitro withdrawal of estrogens from primary cell cultures of neonatal murine calvaria on IL-6 production. IL-6 production in ex vivo cultures of bone marrow cells maintained in the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or PTH was greater in marrow cells from ovariectomized mice than in those from sham-operated animals or ovariectomized animals receiving estrogen replacement. In line with this finding, addition of 17 beta-estradiol to calvaria cell cultures followed by withdrawal of the steroid caused an increase in the amount of IL-6 produced in response to the subsequent stimulation of these cultures with IL-1 or PTH compared to that in cultures that had never been treated with estradiol; when the inactive isomer 17 alpha-estradiol was used, no change in IL-6 production was observed.

The immunoassay was based on a newly developed monoclonal antibody (IV4E) recognizing a non-TNF-binding site of the p55 TNFR. The IV4E antibody immunoprecipitated a 55 kDa TNF binding protein from HL-60 cells. No binding of IV4E to the p75 TNFR could be detected. Bound TNFR to IV4E was detected with digoxigenin (DIG) labeled TNF. This assay could detect down to 300 pg/ml of soluble p55, which represents an 8-10-fold increase in sensitivity compared to earlier developed immunoassays. The assay was specific for soluble p55 TNFR present in serum and cell culture supernatants, since addition of excess unlabeled TNF together with DIG labeled TNF inhibited the signal. TNF concentrations up to 10 ng/ml in the TNFR sample did not affect the assay, indicating that TNFRs can be measured in samples containing TNF. The new immunoassay was used to study the mechanisms underlying the release of soluble p55 TNFR from U937 cells stimulated with TPA. The TPA induced release of soluble p55 TNFR from U937 cells occurred in two phases. First, a rapid increase of soluble p55 was observed after the addition of TPA. Later, the release of p55 occurred at a slower rate, and this release was inhibited by known inhibitors of protein synthesis and intracellular transport. Addition of TPA increased the p55 mRNA expression in U937 cells.

Tissue culture wells were coated with insoluble 3H-labeled elastin substrate. Human blood neutrophils (0.5 to 2.0 x 10(6) cells/ml/well) were incubated in the coated wells for 4 to 18 h at 37 degrees C in the presence of varying concentrations of serum or purified alpha 1-antitrypsin (A1AT).

M1 myeloblastic cells were chosen for this purpose because of their high growth sensitivity to interleukin 6 (IL-6), transforming growth factor beta 1 and alpha- and beta-interferons. It is reported here that IL-6 elevated the junB and c-jun mRNA levels and induced the formation of a novel DNA-protein complex with high sequence specificity to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element (TRE) oligonucleotides. This IL-6 induced TRE binding complex was abolished by anti-Jun specific antibodies and was efficiently competed by an oligonucleotide that comprises the mouse homologue of a previously described human c-myc negative DNA element. It persisted in cells for at least 48 h after IL-6 treatment and failed to be induced by alpha- and beta-interferons or by transforming growth factor beta 1, which affected differently the pattern of jun mRNA expression. To further explore regulatory and functional aspects of this induced TRE binding activity, an IL-6 resistant M1 clone was isolated and further analyzed. This clone carried a postreceptor deficiency that abrogated completely the growth inhibitory responses to IL-6 but did not interfere with the induction of two differentiation related cell surface markers. Interestingly, the IL-6 resistant clone had lost two molecular responses to IL-6, induction of TRE binding activity and suppression of the c-myc gene.

Recently, we established a pituitary FS-like cell line, TtT/GF, which was derived from an isologously transplantable pituitary thyrotropic tumor line induced by radiothyroidectomy. In studies to examine the function of FS cells, we found that two forms of a novel hypophysiotropic peptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), were potent activators of TtT/GF cells. Both the 27- and 38-amino acid forms of PACAP (PACAP-27 and PACAP-38) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) increased the levels of cAMP in TtT/GF cells in a similar dose-dependent manner.

The objective of this study was to establish an optimum assay for use with serum and plasma samples. While adopting the commonly used L-M cell bioassay to test serum and plasma samples, we noted non-specific staining of cell debris and protein by crystal violet dye, even if the wells were washed prior to staining. However, when we replaced crystal violet with tetrazolium salts to measure cell viability, we discovered that both serum and plasma, from a variety of species, non-specifically reduced both MTT and XTT tetrazolium salts to a colored formazan product resulting in absorbance values significantly higher than those of medium and serum controls. This effect was particularly pronounced with fetal bovine serum which showed significant color development with as little as 6% serum in the test wells. Maximum sensitivity can only be obtained by eliminating these false negative readings. Therefore the serum or plasma containing supernatant must be removed from the test wells and replaced with fresh serum-free medium prior to addition of the substrate. This finding should be applicable to other body fluids such as urine, milk, and synovial fluid as well as any tetrazolium based assay for cell viability which uses serum-supplemented culture medium. Additionally, when the substrate XTT, which reduces to a water-soluble formazan product, was compared to MTT which reduces to a water-insoluble product, XTT was found to be superior since elimination of the solubilization process resulted in reduction of assay time. Also, overall absorbance readings using XTT were higher than with MTT, without any loss of sensitivity.

At physiological concentrations (1-10 micrograms/ml, 30-300 nM), thrombin significantly enhances T cell proliferation in response to mitogens, superantigens, alloantigens, and anti-CD3 stimulation.

To our surprise, preparations of monomeric IgG (mIgG) also enhanced the production of IL-6 by MC, but to a lower extent when compared to levels induced by AIgG. Very little amounts of aggregated F(ab')2 fragments [AF(ab')2] bound to MC and consequently no significant enhancement of IL-6 release by AF(ab')2 was seen, suggesting that IL-6 production is an Fc receptor-mediated phenomenon. The production of IL-6 by MC is inhibitable by cycloheximide, thus indicating de novo synthesis. Northern blot analysis revealed a threefold increase in mRNA for IL-6 by AIgG in vitro.

We report herein that S107 cells express cytoplasmic kappa B-binding material detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay that by several criteria represents authentic NF-kappa B. Despite the presence of cytoplasmic NF-kappa B, several stimuli known to induce nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B failed to do so in S107 cells, including: the PKC agonist, PMA; the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide; and LPS. Transfection of S107 cells with a kappa B-CAT reporter gene construct confirmed the absence of functional activity. Importantly, a global failure of nuclear transcription factor expression was ruled out by the ability of PMA to induce nuclear expression of another trans-acting factor, AP-1. Thus, rather than lacking NF-kappa B altogether, S107 cells manifest disordered regulation of NF-kappa B in which cytoplasmic material is incapable of translocation to the nucleus. While Northern analysis failed to reveal a gross defect in the mRNA coding for the DNA binding subunit of NF-kappa B, UV-photo-cross-linking followed by denaturing gel electrophoresis demonstrated the presence of a cytoplasmic kappa B-binding protein of abnormally elevated molecular size.

Synthetic mirror pseudo cord factors with alkyl chains ranging from C16 to C18 have very weak interleukin-6-inducing capacities and lack mitogenic activities for T-cell proliferation.

Transforming growth factors-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) may be involved in inflammatory reactions but its actions are controversial and require further in vivo studies. We employed a rabbit dermal inflammation model to investigate the effect of TGF-beta 1 on PMNL migration induced by cytokines and chemotactic factors, using 51Cr-labelled leucocytes to quantify PMNL accumulation in dermal lesions. Injection of TGF-beta 1, over a wide dose range, alone did not elicit PMNL accumulation (0.14 x 10(6) PMNL/site). This contrasted with responses to interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) (11.8 x 10(6) PMNL/site), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (4.5), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (14.9), FNLP (10.1), or IL-8 (6.6). However, when sites were pretreated for 3 hr with TGF-beta 1 (1-10 ng) and subsequently re-injected with the inflammatory stimuli, TGF-beta 1 primed the tissue for an enhanced recruitment of PMNL in response to the endothelium-activating inflammatory agents, IL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha and LPS, but not to IL-8 or FNLP, which are directly PMNL chemotactic. For example, with IL-1 alpha, PMNL accumulation was 205% greater than the additive sum of each response alone (P < 0.05). This was confirmed histologically. TGF-beta 1 pretreatment enhanced PMNL accumulation over a wide dose range of IL-1 alpha and LPS. TGF-beta 1 did not alter the kinetics of IL-1 alpha or LPS-induced PMNL accumulation, but increased the peak rate of accumulation in lesions. Using an in vitro PMNL transendothelial migration system, TGF-beta 1 (10 ng/ml) was found to prime the endothelium for responsiveness to a submaximal dose of IL-1 alpha (0.005 ng/ml) or a threshold dose of LPS (0.01 ng/ml), resulting in enhanced PMNL transendothelial migration.

This study analyzes the effects of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) on cytokine expression in different cell lineages. Recombinant human LIF increases levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA in human articular chondrocytes as demonstrated by Northern blotting. These cytokine mRNAs are detectable as early as 1.3 h after stimulation and reach their maximum after 5 h. The LIF effects are dose dependent and of similar magnitude to those of IL-1. By metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation it is shown that LIF induces synthesis and secretion of IL-6. IL-6 bioactivity in conditioned media, as measured by the B9 hybridoma proliferation assay, is increased by LIF. Effects of LIF on cytokine expression are not confined to connective tissue cells. By PCR it is shown that human blood monocytes express IL-6 mRNA after stimulation with LIF. An increase in IL-6 mRNA levels is detectable 2 h after stimulation, and this starts to decline by 5 h. The response is of shorter duration as compared with IL-1 beta. In addition to increased mRNA expression, LIF also stimulates release of biologically active IL-6 from blood monocytes. In synoviocytes and neuronal as well as epithelial cell lines, LIF increases IL-1 beta and IL-6 gene expression. In summary, LIF induces cytokine expression in a wide variety of tissues.

MDP pretreatment of BMM for 3 h not only enhanced the total level of LPS-induced TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha, and IL-6 mRNA (respectively 2.9-, 1.6-, and 2.4-fold increase), but it also delayed the kinetics of IL-1 alpha and IL-6 species accumulation. The enhancement induced by MDP pretreatment at the level of cytokine mRNA accumulation was correlated with an increase in LPS-induced TNF and IL-6 biologic activity production in supernatant fluids.

Both TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 mRNA were found in resting human thymocytes by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Using dual-color immunofluorescence with TNF-PE we found that the population of cells which express TNF-R2 also express high levels of the TCR alpha, beta-CD3 complex, CD4 or CD8, and IL-2 receptor alpha chain.

Furthermore, the binding of soluble human IL-6 receptor to immobilized IL-6 was studied using real-time interaction analysis. The recombinant soluble receptor showed biological activity on HepG2 cells stably transfected with a cDNA coding for IL-6 (HepG2-IL-6 cells).

Rolling flux and average leukocyte rolling velocity in ICAM-1-deficient mice was not different from wild-type mice, but P-selectin/ICAM-1-deficient mice showed a total absence of rolling for at least 2 h after surgical trauma. Rolling in both wild-type and ICAM-1-deficient mice 60-120 min after trauma was significantly inhibited by a P-selectin monoclonal antibody (mAb) (RB40.34). In contrast, an mAb (KAT-1) blocking ICAM-1 binding to leukocyte function-associated antigen 1 did not block residual rolling in P-selectin-deficient mice. TNF-alpha induced leukocyte rolling in P-selectin/ICAM-1-deficient mice, but the rolling flux fraction was significantly lower than in TNF-alpha-treated ICAM-1-deficient mice. Leukocyte rolling in P-selectin/ICAM-1-deficient mice treated with TNF-alpha for 3 h was completely blocked by an E-selectin mAb (9A9E3), and partially by an L-selectin mAb (MEL-14).

Leukocyte rolling velocities were significantly reduced after TNF-alpha treatment and were similar in wild-type and gene-targeted strains. We conclude that the residual trauma-induced leukocyte rolling seen in P-selectin-deficient mice is completely abolished by concomitant ICAM-1 deficiency.

Recent in-vitro studies have suggested that GECs are able to secrete substances which may modulate glomerular injury. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) has been shown to be a potent mediator of glomerular injury. It is also known that IL-6 could be produced by various cells. METHODS: IL-6 production by rat GECs in culture was examined in this study. IL-6 bioactivity in conditioned medium collected from cultured GECs (GEC-CM) was measured using IL-6 dependent murine hybridoma cell line, namely B9 cells. IL-6 gene expression by GECs was analysed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Effects of recombinant IL-6 on the proliferation of GECs and type IV collagen secretion by GECs were evaluated to examine the possible role of GECs derived IL-6. RESULTS: GEC-CM stimulated B9 cells growth in a dose dependent fashion. The mitogenic activity was inhibitable by anti-murine IL-6 antibody. De-novo synthesis of IL-6 was suggested by the demonstration of IL-6 mRNA by GECs using the RT-PCR. Secretion of IL-6 by GECs was increased by transforming growth factor beta but not by IL-1 beta. Recombinant murine IL-6 stimulated GECs growth and their type IV collagen secretion.

Normal and CD4+ T-cell-depleted mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of ethanol or saline 0.5 hr before P. carinii challenge and killed 3 hr later for bronchoalveolar lavage. Acute alcohol treatment decreased significantly tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activity and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) recovered in the lavage in response to the pathogen. Depletion of CD4+ T-cells did not potentiate the effect of alcohol on the early inflammatory response to the pathogen any further. In normal animals, in vivo interferon (IFN)-gamma pretreatment augmented significantly the P. carinii-stimulated lung TNF response and PMNL recruitment. However, IFN-gamma pretreatment prevented the alcohol-induced suppression of TNF secretion without affecting the PMNL recruitment.

In the present study, we characterized the regulation of IL-6 gene expression in BMSCs during MM cell adhesion. Adhesion of ARH-77, HS-Sultan, IM-9, and U266 MM cell lines to BMSCs and BMSC lines (LP 101 and AA 101) triggered 5-through 15-fold and 2-through 4-fold increases in IL-6 secretion, respectively. IL-6 mRNA transcripts were undetectable by Northern blotting in IM-9 MM cells or LP 101 BMSCs cultured alone; however, adherence of IM-9 cells to LP 101 cells induced a transient increase in IL-6 transcripts at 6 hours, followed by peak IL-6 secretion at 24 hours. To confirm increased IL-6 transcription and characterize its regulation, LP101 BMSCs were transiently transfected with full length and deletion fragments of the IL-6 promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Transient transfection of LP101 BMSCs with plasmid containing an intact NF-kappa B site showed a 6.8 +/- 0.4-fold increase in CAT activity triggered by IM-9 MM cell adhesion (n = 3, P < .05). Transfection of LP 101 cells with plasmid containing a single base pair deletion from the NF-kapp B binding motif abolished the MM adhesion-induced increase in CAT activity, whereas transfection with plasmid containing three copies of synthetic NF-kappa B sequence resulted in an 8.1 +/- 0.7-fold increase in CAT activity related to MM adhesion (n = 3, P < .05). These data suggest that the NF-kappa B site is one of the essential regulatory elements for MM cell adhesion-induced IL-6 transcription in BMSCs.

It has been reported that prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) can induce granulocytic differentiation and that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) can induce monocytic differentiation. We have now examined the effects of these compounds, both alone and in combination, on HL-60 cell differentiation. PGE1 (1 microgram/ml) or 1,25(OH)2D3 (10 nM) each inhibited cell proliferation over 48-96 hours of treatment, but combined treatment with both agents was necessary to produce a strong inhibition. The percentage of HL-60 cells that can reduce nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) (a characteristic index of early monocytic or granulocytic differentiation) increased 13-fold within 72 hours of PGE1 treatment, and 1,25(OH)2D3 produced a five-fold stimulation. However, combined treatment (PGE1 plus 1,25(OH)2D3) produced a dramatic 35-fold increase. HL-60 cells did not produce significant levels of nitric oxide (NO) before 48 hours in culture, and treatment with PGE1 or 1,25(OH)2D3 did not significantly increase cellular NO elaboration over control levels. However, combined treatment produced a striking 12-fold increase over control levels. Similarly, combined treatment was necessary to obtain the maximal time-dependent stimulation of cellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity (a marker of granulocytic differentiation) as well as acid phosphatase (ACP) activity. During this same period of time, PGE1, but not 1,25(OH)2D3, markedly stimulated cellular elaboration of interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and 1,25(OH)2D3 cotreatment strongly augmented these effects. Thus, combined treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 plus PGE1 generally augmented the apparent conversion of these cells, producing synergistic (multiplicative) or additive effects. Furthermore, PGE1 induced within 48 hours the more general phenotypic changes classically associated with the differentiation of these cells: increased expression of chloroacetate esterase (ChAE) (a granulocytic marker), decreases in the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio (characteristic of development beyond the promyelocyte/myelocyte stage), and major alterations in morphology from floating spherical cells to loosely adherent, elliptical polygons. 1,25(OH)2D3 had little effect itself on most of these parameters, but augmented the morphological changes induced by PGE1 treatment. Within 48 hours, the ability of these cells to reduce the tetrazolium salt WST-1, a general measure of cellular metabolic activity, was increased by PGE1, but not by 1,25(OH)2D3; however, the combination of 1,25(OH)2D3 and PGE1 again produced the strongest stimulation. Similarly, only PGE1 significantly reduced intracellular ATP levels, but combined treatments produced a more pronounced decrease. In summary, our findings suggest that PGE1, not 1,25(OH)2D3, is sufficient to promote rapid in vitro differentiation of HL-60 cells along the granulocyte pathway; however, the PGE1-induced conversion of these cells is markedly augmented by cotreatment with 1,25(OH)2D3. In addition, these converted HL-60 cells preferentially utilize the glycolytic pathway, rather than the citric acid cycle, for production of ATP, a metabolic characteristic that resembles that described for mature granulocytes.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "T", "last_name": "Kawase", "initials": "T", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Pharmacology, Niigata University School of Dentistry, Gakkocho-dori, Japan."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S", "last_name": "Ogata", "initials": "S", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Orikasa", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "D M", "last_name": "Burns", "initials": "DM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Calcified tissue international", "issn": ["0171-967X"], "volume": "57", "issue": "5", "pub_year": "1995", "pub_month": "Nov", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8566235", "doi": "10.1016/0014-5793(95)01495-0", "title": "Elevated cPLA2 levels as a mechanism by which the p70 TNF and p75 NGF receptors enhance apoptosis.", "abstract": "The 70-kDa TNF cell surface receptor (p70TNFR) and the related 75-kDa nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor (p75NGFR) can enhance cell death.

Moreover, upregulation of the production and/or action of IL-6 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of disease states characterized by excessive osteoclastic bone resorption, including the osteopenias associated with loss of either ovarian or testicular function. This article highlights this evidence and attempts to clarify the role of cytokines in the bone loss associated with gonadal deficiency. Specifically, it reviews data demonstrating that the protective effects of estrogens and androgens on the skeleton are mediated through their ability to inhibit IL-6 production. Both of these steroids exert their effects by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of the IL-6 gene promoter via mechanisms involving their respective specific receptors. Upon loss of gonadal function in either sex, there occurs an upregulation of osteoclast formation which is mediated by IL-6. Consistent with this, IL-6-deficient mice do not exhibit an increase in the formation of osteoclasts after ovariectomy or orchidectomy, and are protected from the bone loss caused by the loss of gonadal function in either sex. Even though these observations establish that IL-6 is an essential pathogenetic factor in the bone loss caused by gonadal deficiency, it remains unclear whether IL-6 is the sole pathogenetic factor or whether IL-1, TNF, and IL-11 may also be involved. However, in contrast to IL-6, these cytokines do not seem to be directly regulated by sex steroids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "S C", "last_name": "Manolagas", "initials": "SC", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, McClellan VA Medical Center, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock 72205, USA."], "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Bone", "issn": ["8756-3282"], "volume": "17", "issue": "2 Suppl", "pub_year": "1995", "pub_month": "Aug", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8579960", "doi": "10.1016/8756-3282(95)00332-2", "title": "In vivo, human parathyroid hormone fragment (hPTH 1-34) transiently stimulates immediate early response gene expression, but not proliferation, in trabecular bone cells of young rats.", "abstract": "Intermittent PTH increases trabecular bone mass in vivo by stimulating osteoblast differentiation to increase bone formation.

We investigated if PTH regulated mRNA expression of proto-oncogenes, c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc, early response genes that have been shown to be involved in the regulation of both cell proliferation and differentiation. As PTH also regulates the early expression of the cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), in bone cells in vitro, we also investigated if this occurred in vivo, in concert with the other early response genes. Northern blot hybridization was used to analyze mRNA expression in the metaphysis of the distal femur of young rats. To determine the proliferative state in these femurs, mRNA expression of the cell proliferation marker histone, H4, was assessed. Subcutaneous administration of a single injection of human PTH (1-34) at 8 micrograms/100 g, a dose known to increase bone forming surfaces, induced rapid and transient expression of c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, and IL-6 mRNA. A second novel transcript for IL-6 was detected, but its significance remains unknown. Induction of all these messages was evident by 1 h; the levels of mRNA returned to baseline after 3-6 h. Concurrently, PTH had a small inhibitory effect on the expression of histone H4 mRNA.

In IL-2-stimulated T cells, rapamycin impedes progression through the G1/S transition of the proliferation cycle, resulting in a mid-to-late G1 arrest. Two major biochemical alterations underlie this mode of action. The first one affects the phosphorylation/activation of the p70 S6 kinase (p70s6k), an early event of cytokine-induced mitogenic response. By inhibiting this enzyme, whose major substrate is the 40S ribosomal subunit S6 protein, rapamycin reduces the translation of certain mRNA encoding for ribosomal proteins and elongation factors, thereby decreasing protein synthesis. A second, later effect of rapamycin in IL-2-stimulated T cells is an inhibition of the enzymatic activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase cdk2-cyclin E complex, which functions as a crucial regulator of G1/S transition. This inhibition results from a prevention of the decline of the p27 cdk inhibitor, that normally follows IL-2 stimulation. To mediate these biochemical alterations, rapamycin needs to bind to intracellular proteins, termed FKBP, thereby forming a unique effector molecular complex. However, neither(p70s6k) inhibition, nor p27-induced cdk2-cyclin E inhibition are directly caused by the FKBP-rapamycin complex. Instead, this complex physically interacts with a novel protein, designated \"mammalian target of rapamycin\" (mTOR), which has sequence homology with the catalytic domain of phosphatidylinositol kinases and may therefore be itself a kinase. mTOR may act upstream of (p70s6K) and cdk2-cyclin E in a linear or bifurcated pathway of growth regulation.

METHODS: SV 40-immortalized HRPE (SVRPE) cells were exposed to TNF with and without pretreatment with the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor calphostin C or the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H8. SV40-immortalized HRPE cells also were treated with the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or with the PKA activators forskolin plus 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine or dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) alone. Membrane fractions from untreated and treated SVRPE cells were assayed for PKC activity, and whole cell lysates were assayed for cAMP accumulation and PKA activity. Flow cytometry was performed on SVRPE cells using a monoclonal antibody specific to ICAM-1. RESULTS: Activation of TNFR p55 on SVRPE cells with TNF resulted in a rapid increase of PKC activity at 1 minute, with a subsequent downregulation to baseline. There was no increase in intracellular cAMP accumulation or PKA activity within the first 10 minutes; however, both increased within 30 minutes and returned to baseline within 1 hour. SV40-immortalized HRPE cells treated with TNF for 1 hour showed maximal induction of ICAM-1 expression at 18 hours. ICAM-1 induction by TNF treatment was inhibited by calphostin C pretreatment and not by H8 pretreatment. Protein kinase C activation with PMA for 3 hours was sufficient to induce ICAM-1 on SVRPE cells at 18 hours, whereas treatment with the PKA activators forskolin or dibutyryl cAMP did not induce ICAM-1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor necrosis factor sequentially activates the PKC and PKA pathways in SVRPE cells by way of the TNFR p55. The PKC pathway in necessary for TNF-mediated ICAM-1 upregulation, and specific activation of the PKC pathway with PMA is sufficient to induce ICAM-1 on these cells. SV40-immortalized HRPE cells may serve as a model in which to study further the functional signaling pathways associated with TNFR p55.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "B D", "last_name": "Sippy", "initials": "BD", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Pathology, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, 90033, USA."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "F M", "last_name": "Hofman", "initials": "FM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A D", "last_name": "Wright", "initials": "AD", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J L", "last_name": "Wang", "initials": "JL", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "R", "last_name": "Gopalakrishna", "initials": "R", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "U", "last_name": "Gundimeda", "initials": "U", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S", "last_name": "He", "initials": "S", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S J", "last_name": "Ryan", "initials": "SJ", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "D R", "last_name": "Hinton", "initials": "DR", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "issn": ["0146-0404"], "volume": "37", "issue": "4", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": "Mar", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8597870", "doi": null, "title": "Phosphorylation of the 26 kDa TNF precursor in monocytic cells and in transfected HeLa cells.", "abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) functions both as a soluble molecule and as a cell surface 26 kDa transmembrane protein, from which the soluble form is proteolytically derived.

In contrast, unstimulated PMNs induced no significant increases in EC necrosis. To examine the mechanisms of activated PMN-mediated EC necrosis, the oxygen radical scavengers superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase, as well as the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT), soybean trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor (TCI), and aprotinin, were studied in coculture experiments.

Although aprotinin enhanced respiratory burst, this agent inhibited necrosis by downregulating PMN CD11b and PMN-EC adhesion.

DNA damaging agents such as ionizing or UV radiation, and some chemical agents induce WAF1 in wild-type p53 containing cells, thereby halting cell cycle progression. WAF1 expression is also induced through a p53-independent pathway. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) is a cytotoxic/cytostatic compound for some human cancer cells. We examined a series of myeloid leukemic cell lines that expressed either no p53 (HL-60, K562) or mutant inactive p53 (KG-1, KCL22,THP-1, U937). The KG-1, HL-60, K562, and KCL22 myeloid leukemic cells increased their levels of WAF1 mRNA in the presence of TNF alpha. We focused on KG-1 cells to determine how TNF alpha modulated WAF1 expression. WAF1 mRNA increased in a dose-dependent manner in the cells after exposure to increasing concentrations of TNF alpha, and this increase occurred in the absence of new protein synthesis. An increase of WAF1 protein and a concominant decrease of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity also was found in KG-1 cells. Flow cytometry using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine showed an increase in the proportion of TNF alpha- treated KG-1 cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. TNF alpha enhanced the rate of WAF1 transcription only 1.4 fold in TNF alpha-treated KG-1 cells as compared to untreated cells. Notably, however, the half-life (t 1/2) of WAF1 mRNA in TNF alpha-treated cells was 2.5 hours as compared to 0.5 hours in untreated cells.

The lag period may be a physiologically important feature of the action of such agents on neutrophils in that it may allow for migration before secretion. However, the mechanism that interposes such a long delay between stimulus and response is unknown. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) mediates some of its actions by triggering sphingomyelinase to generate ceramide. In adherent human neutrophils, however, exogenous ceramide did not mimic TNF-alpha's ability to stimulate cell spreading, paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation, or the respiratory burst. On the contrary, ceramide suppressed each such response. Ceramide did so by extending the lag period in the cells' response to TNF-alpha. Ceramide extended the lag period whether it was added exogenously or generated endogenously by sphingomyelinase, and the effect was reversible. Remarkably, however, ceramide inhibited cell spreading or the respiratory burst only if added together with TNF-alpha or within the next few minutes. Neutrophils ignored ceramide if it was added later, even if the TNF-alpha-triggered respiratory burst had not yet commenced. These features suggest that an early, brief elevation of ceramide in response to TNF-alpha could mediate the lag period. By temporarily inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation, cell spreading, and the respiratory burst, ceramide or a functionally similar mediator could serve as a phase coordinator of the neutrophil's response to soluble agonists.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Fuortes", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Beatrice and Samuel A.

PB caused a concentration-dependent increase in benzyloxyresorufin O-deethylase (BROD) activity with maximal effects (a 25-fold increase) at concentrations of 0.3 to 1 mM. The induction of BROD activity was linear over 24 hr of exposure. Immunoblot profiles of P4502B1/2 agreed with measurements of enzyme activity. In addition to inducing P4502B1/2, PB (0.75 mM) also increased the levels of P450 reductase by approximately 2-fold following a 24-hr exposure to PB. When IL-6 was added concomitantly with or up to 12 hr after the addition of PB, the PB induction of BROD activity and immunoreactivity was inhibited significantly. When 18 hr elapsed between the time of addition of PB and IL-6, the inhibitory effects of IL-6 were no longer apparent, suggesting that the actions of IL-6 were mediated by early events in the induction process. IL-6 did not affect the PB induction of P450 reductase. To determine whether IL-6 altered the degradation of P4502B1/2, hepatocytes were exposed to PB for 24 hr, then washed, and the loss of BROD activity and immunoreactivity following incubation with a protein synthesis inhibitor was measured. IL-6 did not alter the rate of loss of either enzyme activity or immunoreactivity, indicating that the effects of IL-6 could not be attributed to the enhanced degradation of P4502B1/2.

Chemotaxis assays were elaborated using short term cultures of rat type II pneumocytes.

Previous work in this laboratory demonstrated that a serine protease termed AP24 was activated by TNF or UV light and induced DNA fragmentation in isolated nuclei. This study extended these findings to examine the role of these enzymes in apoptosis of the U937 cell line and the mechanism of resistance of its variant, U9-TR. Although this subclone was selected by growth in TNF, it was unexpectedly found to resist apoptosis induced by UV light, but was still sensitive to anti-Fas-induced DNA fragmentation. Here we show that in contrast to normal U937 cells, UV light and TNF both failed to activate neutral or acidic sphingomyelinase or AP24 in the U9-TR variant. However, anti-Fas activated both neutral and acidic sphingomyelinase in the variant comparable to that seen in parental U937. The U9-TR variant could be sensitized to TNF or UV light activation of both sphingomyelinase and DNA fragmentation by the protein phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A. Furthermore, exogenous bacterial-derived sphingomyelinase caused U9-TR activation of AP24 and DNA fragmentation comparable to that in the parental U937. Exposure of permeabilized U937 cells to ceramide caused internucleosomal DNA cleavage that was blocked by an inhibitor of AP24. Taken altogether, these findings demonstrate that TNF or UV light activate sphingomyelinase that leads to the generation of ceramide resulting in activation of AP24 and DNA fragmentation in sensitive cells. A selective defect in signals leading to sphingomyelinase activation can confer resistance to apoptosis even though the variant is still sensitive to downstream apoptotic signals such as nuclear DNA fragmentation by activated exogenous AP24.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "S C", "last_name": "Wright", "initials": "SC", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Palo Alto Institute of Molecular Medicine, Mountain View, California 94043, USA."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "H", "last_name": "Zheng", "initials": "H", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J", "last_name": "Zhong", "initials": "J", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "issn": ["0892-6638"], "volume": "10", "issue": "2", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": "Feb", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8642841", "doi": "10.1016/0145-2126(95)00085-2", "title": "Therapeutic strategies for inhibition of interleukin-6 mediated multiple myeloma cell growth.", "abstract": null, "author_list": [{"fore_name": "A", "last_name": "Ogata", "initials": "A", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "K C", "last_name": "Anderson", "initials": "KC", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Leukemia research", "issn": ["0145-2126"], "volume": "20", "issue": "4", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": "Apr", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8643498", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.93.10.4885", "title": "Elevated interleukin 6 is induced by prostaglandin E2 in a murine model of inflammation: possible role of cyclooxygenase-2.", "abstract": "Injection of mineral oils such as pristane into the peritoneal cavities of BALB/c mice results in a chronic peritonitis associated with high tissue levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6).

Levels of both PGE2 and IL-6 are elevated in inflammatory exudates from pristane-treated mice compared with lavage samples from untreated mice. The Cox-2 gene is induced in the peritoneal macrophage fraction isolated from the mice. A cause and effect relationship between increased macrophage PGE2 and IL-6 production is shown in vitro. When peritoneal macrophages are activated with an inflammatory stimulus (polymerized albumin), the Cox-2 gene is induced and secretion of PGE2 and IL-6 increases, with elevated PGE2 appearing before IL-6. Cotreatment with 1 microM indomethacin inhibits PGE2 production by the cells and reduces the induction of IL-6 mRNA but has no effect on Cox-2 mRNA, consistent with the fact that the drug inhibits catalytic activity of the cyclooxygenase but does not affect expression of the gene. Addition of exogenous PGE2 to macrophages induces IL-6 protein and mRNA synthesis, indicating that the eicosanoid stimulates IL-6 production at the level of gene expression. PGE2-stimulated IL-6 production is unaffected by addition of indomethacin.

However, the receptors and the signaling pathway used by TNF-alpha that mediate the inhibition of IR activity are unknown. We show here that human TNF-alpha, which binds only to the murine p55 TNF receptor (TNFR), is as effective at inhibiting insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1 in adipocytes and myeloid 32D cells as murine TNF-alpha, which binds to both p55 TNFR and p75 TNFR. Likewise, antibodies that are specific agonists for p55 TNFR or p75 TNFR demonstrate that stimulation of p55 TNFR is sufficient to inhibit insulin signaling, though a small effect can also be seen with antibodies to p75 TNFR. Exogenous sphingomyelinase and ceramides, known to be formed by activation of p55 TNFR, inhibit IR and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and convert IRS-1 into an inhibitor of IR tyrosine kinase in vitro. Myeloid 32D cells expressing IR and IRS-1 are sensitive to this inhibition, but cells expressing IR and IRS-2 are resistant, pointing to an important difference in the biological function between IRS-1 and IRS-2.

Primary cultures of rat adrenal zona glomerulosa cells were exposed to test agents and IL-6 and TNF release determined by the 7TD1 and WEHI bioassays, respectively. Dopamine increased basal IL-6 release and potentiated IL-6 release stimulated by ACTH, LPS or IL-1 beta. Dopamine inhibited basal and secretagogue-stimulated (LPS and IL-1 beta) TNF release. These effects of dopamine were mediated by D2 receptors because N-0437, a D2 agonist, had effects on TNF and IL-6 release identical to those of dopamine.

Because TNF and IL-6 regulate adrenal steroid release, these cytokines may serve as autocrine or paracrine mediators of adrenal gland function.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "P K", "last_name": "Ritchie", "initials": "PK", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Zoology, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT 84602, USA."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Ashby", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "H H", "last_name": "Knight", "initials": "HH", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A M", "last_name": "Judd", "initials": "AM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "European journal of endocrinology", "issn": ["0804-4643"], "volume": "134", "issue": "5", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": "May", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8672529", "doi": "10.1016/0304-419x(96)00007-8", "title": "Association of TM4SF proteins with integrins: relevance to cancer.", "abstract": null, "author_list": [{"fore_name": "M E", "last_name": "Hemler", "initials": "ME", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

Our analysis suggests that the previously-described functional elements of the GM-CSF promoter, kappa B and a repetitive CATTT/A motif, the former co-exists with an overlapping 9 nucleotide site which silences promoter activity, and the CATTT/A complex binds multiple polypeptides which differentially contribute to basal and inducible promoter activity. These two sites interact to provide tissue-appropriate and stimulus-specific promoter function. Using DNA-protein cross-linking and co-transfection studies, we demonstrate that the c-rel-related proteins p65 and p50 bind to the GM-CSF promoter and that p65 binding is primarily responsible for the enhancing effects at this site. In addition, we show that the GM-CSF kappa B decanucleotide is inadequate to provide full binding affinity; mutation of nucleotides flanking this site affect promoter function by altering NF-kappa B binding affinity.

Thus far, the underlying mechanisms of PDT regarding cellular responses and gene regulation are poorly understood. Photochemically generated singlet oxygen (1O2) is mainly responsible for cytotoxicity induced by PDT. If targeted cells are not disintegrated, photo-oxidative stress leads to transcription and translation of various stress response and cytokine genes. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, interleukin (IL) 1 and IL-6 are strongly induced by photodynamic treatment, supporting inflammatory action and immunological anti-tumour responses. To investigate the first steps of gene activation, this study focused on the proto-oncogenes c-jun and c-fos, both coding for the transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1), which was found to mediate IL-6 gene expression. We here determine the effects of photodynamic treatment on transcriptional regulation and DNA binding of transcription factor AP-1 in order to understand the modulation of subsequent regulatory steps. Photodynamic treatment of epithelial HeLa cells was performed by incubation with Photofrin and illumination with 630 nm laser light in vitro. Expression of the c-jun and c-fos genes was determined by way of Northern blot analysis, and DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor AP-1 was evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Photofrin-mediated photosensitisation of HeLa cells resulted in a rapid and dose-dependent induction of both genes but preferential expression of c-jun. Compared with the transient expression of c-jun and c-fos by phorbol ester stimulation, photodynamic treatment led to a prolonged activation pattern of both immediate early genes. Furthermore, mRNA stability studies revealed an increased half-life of c-jun and c-fos transcripts resulting from photosensitisation. Although mRNA accumulation after PDT was stronger and more prolonged compared with phorbol ester stimulation, with regard to AP-1 DNA-binding activity, phorbol ester was more efficient. Surprisingly, in addition to the activation of AP-1 DNA-binding via PDT, photodynamic treatment can decrease AP-1 DNA-binding of other strong inducers, such as the protein kinase C-mediated pathway of phorbol esters and the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). This study demonstrates a strong induction of c-jun and c-fos expression by PDT, with prolonged kinetics and mRNA stabilisation as compared with activation by phorbol esters. Interestingly, this observation is not coincident with an overinduction of AP-1 DNA-binding, hence suggesting that post-translational modifications are dominant regulatory mechanisms after PDT that tightly control AP-1 activity in the nucleus thus limiting the risk of deregulated oncogene expression.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "G", "last_name": "Kick", "initials": "G", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Dermatology, Ludwigs-Maximilians University of Munich, Germany."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "G", "last_name": "Messer", "initials": "G", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "G", "last_name": "Plewig", "initials": "G", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "P", "last_name": "Kind", "initials": "P", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A E", "last_name": "Goetz", "initials": "AE", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "British journal of cancer", "issn": ["0007-0920"], "volume": "74", "issue": "1", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": "Jul", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8683136", "doi": null, "title": "Selective growth of human mast cells induced by Steel factor, IL-6, and prostaglandin E2 from cord blood mononuclear cells.", "abstract": "To establish the method for generating a large number of mature human mast cells, we cultured cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) in several conditions in the presence of Steel factor (SF).

When CBMC were cultured instead of CD34+ cells, IL-6 enhanced the mast cell development in the presence but not in the absence of PGE2. PGE2 enhanced the SF- and IL-6-dependent development of mast cells from CBMC probably by blocking granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) secretion from accessory cells, because 1) PGE2, or anti-GM-CSF enhanced the mast cell development induced by SF and IL-6 from CBMC, but not from CD34+ cells; 2) GM-CSF inhibited the enhancing effect of IL-6 on the mast cell development from CD34+ cells; and 3) PGE2 inhibited GM-CSF secretion from CBMC.

All three ligands induce transient increases in E-selectin (peak 4 h) and VCAM-1 (peak 8-24 h), as well as sustained increases in ICAM-1 (plateau 24 h). Quantitatively, TNF is more potent than IL-1, which is much more potent than CD40 ligand. The same hierarchy is observed for transcriptional activation of an E-selectin promoter reporter gene construct in transiently transfected HUVECs. TNF and CD40 ligand each induced activation of the transcription factors NF-kappa B, IRF-1, and ATF-2/c-Jun, measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, but this response appeared quantitatively similar. All three agents transiently (peak 30 min) activated Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), which has been implicated in transcription of E-selectin through its actions on ATF-2/c-Jun. Activation of JNK again showed a hierarchy of potency (TNF > IL-1 >> CD40 ligand), although the time course of induction was similar for all three agents. After 44 h of pretreatment, TNF, IL-1, and CD40 ligand each display homologous desensitization for reinduction of surface expression of E-selectin. A similar pattern of homologous desensitization for reactivation of JNK was observed.

In contrast, stimulation of TNFR80 by a TNFR80-specific TNF mutein did not result in enhancement of tissue factor expression even in the presence of a suboptimal TNFR60 triggering.

Structurally, CD21 consists of 15 to 16 short consensus repeats (SCR) of 60 to 75 amino acids followed by a transmembrane domain and an intracytoplasmic region. We reported that CD23, a low-affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon R2), is a new functional ligand for CD21. We recently found that the sites of interaction of CD23 on CD21 are on SCR 5 to 8 and 1-2. The first site is a lectin-sugar type of interaction and the second site is a protein-protein interaction. We report here that amongst the other ligands for CD21 (EBV, C3d,g and IFN-alpha), only EBV is able to inhibit the binding of CD23 to CD21. Furthermore, even a peptide from gp350/220 of EBV known to bind to CD21 is able to decrease CD23 binding to CD21. Since CD23/CD21 pairing is important in the control of IgE production, we tested the effect of the EBV-derived peptide on immunoglobulin production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and purified tonsillar B cells. Interestingly, the EBV-peptide inhibited IgE and IgG4 production induced by interleukin-4, in a dose-dependent manner. The same results were obtained using either peripheral blood mononuclear cells or purified tonsillar B cells. Another CD21 ligand, C3, did not affect binding of CD23 to CD21 nor the production of IgE and IgG4.

Recently, CD40 ligand (CD40L), with the co-stimulatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10, has been shown to trigger immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion and class switching. In the present report, we have examined the role of IL-6 in mediating B cell differentiation and Ig secretion triggered with CD40L and/or these cytokines. Culture of splenic B cells with CD40L triggered (1) significant (5.4-fold) increases in IL-6 secretion; (2) differentiation, evidenced by sequential loss of B cell (CD20, CD21) and acquisition of plasma cell (CD38, PCA-1) surface antigens (Ags); and (3) Ig secretion. Interleukin-4 increased both IL-6 and IgG secretion stimulated by CD40L. Interleukin-10+ CD40L triggered 100-fold increments in IgG, IgA and IgM secretion, but IL-10 suppressed IL-6 secretion triggered with CD40L +/- IL-4. Exogenous IL-6 can further increase IgG secretion induced by CD40L + IL-10; moreover, the anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody partially blocked IgG secretion triggered by CD40L +/- IL-4 or IL-10. Finally, IL-10 suppressed differentiation of B cells induced by CD40L. These studies suggest that CD40L augments Ig secretion in at least two mechanisms: by triggering IL-6 secretion and related differentiation, and by priming B cells for responsiveness to IL-10.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Urashima", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "D", "last_name": "Chauhan", "initials": "D", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Hatziyanni", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A", "last_name": "Ogata", "initials": "A", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "D", "last_name": "Hollenbaugh", "initials": "D", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A", "last_name": "Aruffo", "initials": "A", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "K C", "last_name": "Anderson", "initials": "KC", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Leukemia research", "issn": ["0145-2126"], "volume": "20", "issue": "6", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": "Jun", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8711133", "doi": "10.1016/0090-6980(95)00182-4", "title": "Induction of both cytosolic phospholipase A2 and prostaglandin H synthase-2 by interleukin-1 beta in WISH cells in inhibited by dexamethasone.", "abstract": "In previous studies we have shown that IL-1 beta induced both PGE2 release and total cellular cPLA2 activity and cPLA2 protein synthesis in human amnion-derived WISH cells.

An ongoing equilibrium between NO and other NO-reactive compounds (e.g. O2 and non-heme iron-sulphur-containing moieties) appears to be important in this respect, even under critical conditions. Thus, NO may prevent liver tissue harm from oxidant stress. Only when this putative counterbalance is upset by an uncontrolled, prolonged and/or massive production of NO, liver tissue damage may occur leading to hepatic inflammation or even tumor development. Moreover, the currently available data support the working hypothesis that hepatocytes partake not only to immunoregulatory processes, but even to immune defence mechanisms.

In venous and arterial endothelial cells, TNF-alpha potently reduced mRNA transcripts of the two VEGF receptors (KDR/flk-1 and flt-1) in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. TNF-alpha at 1 ng/ml induced maximal inhibition of mRNA expression, which fell by approximately 70% after 24 h.

The decrease in KDR/flk-1 mRNA depended partially on new protein synthesis and was abolished by phorbol ester pretreatment. TNF-alpha decreased the amount of 35S-labeled KDR/flk-1 immunoprecipitated by an antibody specific for KDR/flk-1 to 18% of control.

Flow cytometric analysis of leucocyte subpopulations in the spleen showed a reduction in activated (CD25 positive) B and T cells in treated animals, compared to saline treated controls. The results suggest that C inhibition with sCR1, in an unsensitized model of allograft rejection, was able to suppress the vascular and cell mediated components of tissue injury.

We have reported that adenovirus (Ad) infection of TNF-resistant mouse cells renders them susceptible to lysis by TNF and that two sets of proteins encoded by the E3 transcription unit block TNF cytolysis. The E3 protein sets are named E3-14.7K (14,700 kDa) and E3-10.4K/14.5K (a complex of two proteins of 10,400 and 14,500 kDa). TNF activation of the 85-kDa cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) is thought to be essential for TNF cytolysis (i.e.,TNF-induced apoptosis). Here we provide evidence that cPLA2 is important in the response of Ad-infected cells to TNF and that the mechanism by which E3-14.7K and E3-10.4K/14.5K inhibit TNF cytolysis is by inhibiting TNF activation of cPLA2. cPLA2 cleaves arachidonic acid (AA) specifically from membrane phospholipids; therefore, cPLA2 activity was measured by the release of 3H-AA from cells prelabeled with 3H-AA. Uninfected cells or cells infected with wild-type Ad were not lysed and did not release 3H-AA in response to TNF. In contrast, TNF treatment induced cytolysis and 3H-AA release in uninfected cells sensitized to TNF by treatment with cycloheximide and also in infected cells sensitized to TNF by expression of E1A. In C127 cells, in which either E3-14.7K or E3-10.4K/14.5K inhibits TNF cytolysis, either set of proteins inhibited TNF-induced release of 3H-AA. In C3HA cells, in which E3-14.7K but not E3-10.4K/14.5K prevents TNF cytolysis, E3-14.7K but not E3-10.4K/14.5K prevented TNF-induced release of 3H-AA. When five virus mutants with lesions in E3-14.7K were examined, there was a perfect correlation between a mutant's ability to inhibit both TNF-induced cytolysis and release of 3H-AA. E3-14.7K expressed in two stably transfected C127 cell lines prevented both TNF-cycloheximide-induced cytolysis and release of 3H-AA. The E3 proteins also prevented TNF-induced cytolysis and release of 3H-AA in mouse L929 cells, which are spontaneously sensitive to TNF. TNF cytolysis was blocked by dexamethasone, an inhibitor of PLA2 activity, and by nordihydroquaiaretic acid, which inhibits the metabolism of AA to the leukotrienes. Indomethacin, which blocks the formation of prostaglandins from AA, did not inhibit TNF cytolysis. The leukotrienes and prostaglandins are amplifiers of the inflammatory response. We propose that E3-14.7K and E3-10.4K/14.5K function independently in Ad infection to inhibit both cytolysis and inflammation induced by TNF.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "P", "last_name": "Krajcsi", "initials": "P", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, St. Louis University Schoolof Medicine, Missouri 63104, USA."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "T", "last_name": "Dimitrov", "initials": "T", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "T W", "last_name": "Hermiston", "initials": "TW", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A E", "last_name": "Tollefson", "initials": "AE", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "T S", "last_name": "Ranheim", "initials": "TS", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S B", "last_name": "Vande Pol", "initials": "SB", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A H", "last_name": "Stephenson", "initials": "AH", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "W S", "last_name": "Wold", "initials": "WS", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Journal of virology", "issn": ["0022-538X"], "volume": "70", "issue": "8", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": "Aug", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8765329", "doi": "10.1016/0165-5728(96)00034-3", "title": "Effects of substance P and selected other neuropeptides on the synthesis of interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6 in human monocytes: a re-examination.", "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that substance P (SP) and some other neuropeptides are able to induce the synthesis of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

VIP-containing nerve fibers are present in both primary and secondary lymphoid organs, frequently in close proximity to immune cells. In addition, several types of immune cells, including T lymphocytes may function as local VIP sources in the lymphoid microenvironment. VIP released from neuronal and/or non neuronal sources exerts immunomodulatory effects through direct binding to VIP receptors (VIP-Rs), which are expressed on most immune cells. The existence of lymphocytic VIP-Rs has been demonstrated initially through binding studies, and more recently, through molecular biology technology. Both VIP-R1 and VIP-R2, which express high affinity for VIP and related neuropeptides such as the pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP), are present on lymphocyte subsets, and recent reports suggest that whereas VIP-R1 is expressed constitutively, VIP-R2 expression is induced upon lymphocyte activation. Although VIP affects a variety of immune functions, its primary immunomodulatory function seems to be anti-inflammatory in nature. Whereas a rapid inflammatory response is essential for the ultimate elimination of foreign antigens, its intensity and duration have to be strictly controlled to avoid extensive tissue damage. In this respect, neuropeptides with anti-inflammatory functions such as VIP or the structurally related PACAP, timely released within the lymphoid organs, could play an important physiological role in the down-regulation of the immune response. Cytokines, soluble products of immune cells, play major roles in lymphocyte development, activation, and differentiation. As most cytokines are functionally pleiotropic, redundant, and interdependent, local interactions within the cytokine-neuroendocrine network have significant impact on cytokine production and function. Therefore, the immunomodulatory activities of VIP could be mediated, at least partially, through effects on the production of cytokines. The purpose of this article is to review the existing information regarding the VIP modulation of cytokine expression in immune cells. Both VIP and PACAP downregulate the expression of IL-2 mRNA and protein in T cells activated through the T cell receptor, through reducing both the stability and the de novo transcriptional rate of the IL-2 message. Reduction in the amount of IL-2 generated by the activated CD4+ T cells impacts on both T cell proliferation and on further sequential cytokine production. This is indeed the case with IL-4, which is affected by VIP indirectly, through inhibition of IL-2. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of VIP and PACAP on IL-10 production proceeds through a direct transcriptional event. In contrast to IL-2 which functions solely as a proinflammatory cytokine, IL-4 and IL-10 act as pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines, depending on their involvement in specific immune responses. Therefore, depending on interactions with the local cytokine network, VIP and related neuropeptides may contribute significantly to controlling the amplitude and timing of the inflammatory response to foreign antigens. Although the role of VIP and related peptides on T cell development has not been investigated yet, the presence of VIP and VIP-Rs in the thymus, and their effect on thymic cytokine production, suggests that VIP and/or PACAP released locally within the thymic environment could also affect T cell development, and therefore participate in the generation and maturation of immune cells.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "D", "last_name": "Ganea", "initials": "D", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Rutgers University, Department of Biological Sciences, Newark, NJ 07102, USA."], "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Advances in neuroimmunology", "issn": ["0960-5428"], "volume": "6", "issue": "1", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": null, "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8790992", "doi": "10.1016/0014-2999(96)00019-2", "title": "Effect of topical application of a stable prostacyclin analogue, SM-10902 on wound healing in diabetic mice.", "abstract": "The mechanism of wound healing induced by topical application of an ointment containing a new stable prostacyclin analogue, SM-10902 ((+)-methyl[2-[(2R,3aS,4R,5R, 6aS)-octahydro-5-hydroxy-4-[(E)-(3S,5S)-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-1- nonenyl]-2-pentalenyl] ethoxy] acetate), was investigated in the full-thickness wounds of genetically diabetic mice (db/db mice).

Histological evaluation of wounds revealed that SM-10902 ointment increased the capillary number during the early stage of the wound-healing process. These results suggest that SM-10902 ointment promotes wound healing through the stimulation of angiogenesis and the improvement of blood flow in neovascularization of repairing wound and may be useful in the treatment of skin ulcers caused by peripheral circulatory insufficiency.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "T", "last_name": "Yamamoto", "initials": "T", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Research Center, Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "N", "last_name": "Horikawa", "initials": "N", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "Y", "last_name": "Komuro", "initials": "Y", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "Y", "last_name": "Hara", "initials": "Y", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "European journal of pharmacology", "issn": ["0014-2999"], "volume": "302", "issue": "1-3", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": "Apr", "pub_day": "29"}}, {"pmid": "8791485", "doi": "10.1016/s0959-437x(96)90008-8", "title": "Recent advances in tumor necrosis factor and CD40 signaling.", "abstract": "The past year has witnessed remarkable advances in the understanding of signaling by the two TNF (tumor necrosis factor) receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, and the related CD40 receptor.

Cultured fibroblast-like synoviocytes were treated with Et-1 in the absence or presence of C1306, a specific endothelin-A-receptor antagonist. Cell surface expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and CD-44 was determined by immunofluorescence studies, Cyto-ELISA and FACS-analysis. ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and CD-44 were constitutively expressed on cultured FLS. After incubation with Et-1 the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and CD-44 increased. The level of expression of adhesion molecules after Et-1 stimulation was similar to cytokine mediated effects (IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha). IL-1 beta showed the strongest stimulatory effect on the expression of ICAM-1, TNF-alpha preferentially induced the expression of VCAM-1 and CD-44, and Et-1 strongly stimulated the upregulation of CD-44 expression. In addition, Et-1 enhanced significantly the IL-1 beta mediated upregulation of VCAM-1 expression, whereas TNF-alpha mediated expression of VCAM-1 was downregulated by Et-1. Furthermore, the Et-1 induced expression of adhesion molecules on FLS was mediated via the endothelin-A-receptor (EtA-receptor), since C-1306, a selective endothelin-A-receptor antagonist, could block this effect. These results indicate that Et-1 has stimulating effects on FLS in vitro. The expression of adhesion molecules can be upregulated by Et-1 similar to proinflammatory cytokines.

Monocytes and granulocytes were pretreated with alpha-MSH (10(-6) M) before exposing the cells to plasma obtained from patients who had undergone CPB, as CPB plasma would stimulate native monocytes and granulocytes in a manner similar to that observed in CPB patients. Pretreatment of these cells with alpha-MSH significantly diminished the hyperstimulation induced by CPB plasma in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, when the cells were first or simultaneously exposed to CPB plasma and then to alpha-MSH, alpha-MSH had no effect. Furthermore, use of the specific neutral endopeptidase inhibitor, phosphoramidon, significantly increased the efficacy of alpha-MSH in inhibiting CPB-induced immunocyte activation. The data demonstrate that pretreatment of monocyte/macrophages and granulocytes with alpha-MSH effectively inhibits the immune hyperstimulation induced by CPB-plasma exposure. In addition, the data strongly suggest that preexposure to other naturally occurring immune inhibitory substances may diminish the hyperstimulation associated with CPB.

Heart concentrations of MT-1 were significantly increased by IL-6, and were further increased by the combination of IL-6 and Dex, although Dex by itself had no effect. This suggests a synergistic effect of IL-6 and Dex on MT-I synthesis in the heart. A similar synergism was observed in the lung. To study the effect of Zn on the induction of MT and acute phase proteins, Zn, IL-6 and Dex were administered in various concentrations. The increase in liver MT induced by the combination of IL-6 and Dex with Zn (130 micrograms MT/g of liver) was greater than the sum of the increases induced by (IL-6 + Zn) and by (Dex + Zn) (103 micrograms MT/g), suggesting a synergistic increase. The data indicate that the maximal increase in the induction of MT by a combination of IL-6 and Dex depends on an adequate liver Zn content. Thus, the in vivo synergistic induction of acute phase proteins by IL-6, glucocorticoid and Zn may be required for the maximal and rapid response, not only in liver but also in other tissues including heart and lung.

LPS had a lower TNF-R1-shedding activity while TNF alpha did not induce shedding. The IL-1-induced-sTNF-R1-shedding was suppressed by the protein-kinase-A (PKA) inhibitor, H-8, or by H-7, the inhibitor of both PKC and PKA, but not by the specific PKC inhibitor GF. These experiments suggest a role for PKA in the IL-1-shedding signal. No change in TNF-R1 mRNA levels was observed after IL-1 alpha or TNF alpha stimulation while TNF-R2 (p75) mRNA basal levels transiently increased three to fivefold, reaching a peak after four hours followed by an accumulation of sTNF-R2 in the supernatant. Our data suggest that the main receptor expressed on HPMC is TNF-R1. Down-regulation and shedding of TNF-R1 induced by IL-1, and the transient expression of TNF-R2 induced by IL-1 and TNF, may regulate the responses to TNF by HPMC.

Abnormalities of retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and mutations of RB gene have been reported in up to 70% of MM patients and 80% of MM-derived cell lines. Because dephosphorylated (activated) pRB blocks transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle whereas phosphorylated (inactivated) pRB releases this growth arrest, we characterized the role of pRB in IL-6-mediated MM cell growth. Both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated pRB were expressed in all serum-starved MM patient cells and MM-derived cell lines, but pRB was predominantly in its phosphorylated form. In MM cells that proliferated in response to IL-6, exogenous IL-6 downregulated dephosphorylated pRB and decreased dephosphorylated pRB-E2F complexes. Importantly, culture of MM cells with RB antisense, but not RB sense, oligonucleotide (ODN) triggered IL-6 secretion and proliferation in MM cells; however, proliferation was only partially inhibited by neutralizing anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody (MoAb). In contrast to MM cells, normal splenic B cells express dephosphorylated pRB. Although CD40 ligand (CD40L) triggers a shift from dephosphorylated to phosphorylated pRB and proliferation of B cells, the addition of exogenous IL-6 to CD40L-treated B cells does not alter either pRB or proliferation, as observed in MM cells. These results suggest that phosphorylated pRB is constitutively expressed in MM cells and that IL-6 further shifts pRB from its dephosphorylated to its phosphorylated form, thereby promoting MM cell growth via two mechanisms; by decreasing the amount of E2F bound by dephosphorylated pRB due to reduced dephosphorylated pRB, thereby releasing growth arrest; and by upregulating IL-6 secretion by MM cells and related IL-6-mediated autocrine tumor cell growth.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Urashima", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A", "last_name": "Ogata", "initials": "A", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "D", "last_name": "Chauhan", "initials": "D", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M B", "last_name": "Vidriales", "initials": "MB", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "G", "last_name": "Teoh", "initials": "G", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "Y", "last_name": "Hoshi", "initials": "Y", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "R L", "last_name": "Schlossman", "initials": "RL", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J A", "last_name": "DeCaprio", "initials": "JA", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "K C", "last_name": "Anderson", "initials": "KC", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Blood", "issn": ["0006-4971"], "volume": "88", "issue": "6", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": "Sep", "pub_day": "15"}}, {"pmid": "8823306", "doi": "10.1172/JCI118928", "title": "Molecular and functional evidence for in vitro cytokine enhancement of human and murine target cell sensitivity to glucocorticoids.

We found that TNF-alpha increased glucocorticoid-induced transcriptional activity of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) via the glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in L-929 mouse fibroblasts transfected with a glucocorticoid-inducible reporter plasmid. In addition, TNF-alpha also enhanced GR number. The TNF-alpha effect on transcriptional activity was absent in other cell lines that express TNF-alpha receptors but not GRs, and became manifest when a GR expression vector was cotransfected, indicating that TNF-alpha, independent of any effect it may have on GR number, has a stimulatory effect on the glucocorticoid-induced transcriptional activity of the GR. Moreover, TNF-alpha increased GR binding to GRE. As a functional biological correlate of this mechanism, priming of L-929 cells with a low (noncytotoxic) dose of TNF-alpha significantly increased the sensitivity to glucocorticoid inhibition of TNF-alpha-induced cytotoxicity/apoptosis.

The phenomenon may therefore reflect a general molecular mechanism whereby cytokines modulate the transcriptional activity of the GR, thus potentiating the counterregulation by glucocorticoids at the level of their target cells.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Costas", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Instituto de Investigaciones M\u00e9dicas, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "T", "last_name": "Trapp", "initials": "T", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M P", "last_name": "Pereda", "initials": "MP", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J", "last_name": "Sauer", "initials": "J", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "R", "last_name": "Rupprecht", "initials": "R", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "V E", "last_name": "Nahmod", "initials": "VE", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J M", "last_name": "Reul", "initials": "JM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "F", "last_name": "Holsboer", "initials": "F", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "E", "last_name": "Arzt", "initials": "E", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "issn": ["0021-9738"], "volume": "98", "issue": "6", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": "Sep", "pub_day": "15"}}, {"pmid": "8828503", "doi": "10.1210/endo.137.10.8828503", "title": "Lysophosphatidylcholine stimulates interleukin-6 release from rat anterior pituitary cells in vitro.", "abstract": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a B-cell differentiation-inducing cytokine that affects the secretion of several neuroendocrine hormones. Normal rat anterior pituitary (AP) cells synthesize and release IL-6, suggesting a paracrine role for the stimulation of AP hormone release by this cytokine. We have previously reported that IL-1 beta enhances IL-6 release and phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in AP cells. Because lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) may function as a second messenger for IL-1 beta, we have investigated the effects of exogenous LPC on IL-6 release from AP cells in vitro. AP cells from male Long-Evans rats were dispersed and cultured for 5-6 days in 96-well (100,000 cells/well) culture plates. Cells were rinsed and incubated in the absence or presence of 1.25-40 microM LPC 18:0 (stearoyl) for 6 h, and IL-6 concentrations determined using the 7-TD1 cell bioassay. LPC 18:0 significantly (P < 0.01) stimulated IL-6 release up to 10-fold in a concentration-related manner. In contrast, LPC 18:0 did not affect PRL release. LPC species substituted with progressively shorter saturated 1-acyl chains (16:0-10:0) were less effective for IL-6 induction. Examination of structurally related glycerophospholipid species revealed the specificity of the LPC stimulation of IL-6 release. Thus, 1.25-40 microM lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE; 18:0) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA; 18:0) were without significant effect on AP IL-6 release, demonstrating the specific functional requirement for the phosphorylcholine headgroup. Hydrolysis of the structurally related choline-linked phospholipid sphingomyelin (SM) has been implicated in IL-1 beta action in certain cell types. Similarly, 1.25-20 microM lysosphingomyelin (sphingosylphosphorylcholine; SPC) also significantly (P < or = 0.01) stimulated IL-6 release from AP cells, although SPC exhibited discernibly lower potency and efficacy than LPC. An acyl analog of platelet-activation factor (PAF), i.e. 18:0-2:0 PC (1-stearoyl-2-acetoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine), differs from LPC by an acetyl group in the sn-2 position; PAF was at least as effective as LPC for the stimulation of IL-6 release from AP cells in vitro. Stimulation of IL-6 release by LPC 18:0 was completely suppressed by pharmacological inhibitors of protein kinase C such as H7 (20 microM) and chelerythrine (5 microM). In addition, H7 (20 microM) abolished the stimulation of IL-6 release by IL-1 beta (0.16-100 ng/mL). These findings demonstrate that LPC, acyl PAF, or SPC (but not other lysophospholipids) stimulate IL-6 release from AP cells in vitro. We conclude that LPC-mediated activation of protein kinase C is involved in the stimulatory actions of IL-1 beta in AP cells.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "B L", "last_name": "Spangelo", "initials": "BL", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Chemistry, University of Nevada Las Vegas 89154, USA. spangelb@nevada.edu"], "emails": ["spangelb@nevada.edu"]}, {"fore_name": "W D", "last_name": "Jarvis", "initials": "WD", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Endocrinology", "issn": ["0013-7227"], "volume": "137", "issue": "10", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": "Oct", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8832581", "doi": "10.1007/BF00168699", "title": "Interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibit the release of [3H]-noradrenaline from mice isolated atria.", "abstract": "In the present study, we have investigated the ability of four cytokines, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-2, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, to modulate the stimulation-induced outflow of radioactivity from isolated superfused mouse atria which where pre-incubated with [3H]-noradrenaline. The tissues were subjected twice to field stimulation (5 Hz frequency, 50 mA intensity, 2 ms pulses for 60 s) and the drugs were added prior to the second stimulation in order to assess their modulatory effects. The results show that mouse recombinant interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibited the stimulation-induced release of radioactivity from the isolated mouse atria. The effect of interleukin-1 beta was blocked by a human recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. The inhibitory effect of interleukin-1 beta was also abolished by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, diclofenac (1 mumol/l) suggesting that the action of interleukin-1 beta might be mediated through the formation of prostaglandins. The effect of interleukin-1 beta appears to be time-dependent, since a stronger inhibition of radio-activity release was observed when the incubation time was increased from 20 to 65 minutes before the second stimulation. Interleukin-2 and interleukin-6 were ineffective in modulating release under these experimental conditions.

This raises the prospect of interactions between the cytokines and glucocorticoids, which may be antagonistic or additive on IL-1 and TNF activity. We, therefore, studied the interactions of the GC dexamethasone (Dex) with IL-4, IL-10, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta on the release of TNF-alpha and IL-1RA by human monocytes and the monocytic THP-1 cell line. Low concentration of Dex (10(-8)-10(-7)M) acted additively with low concentrations of IL-4 (0.01-1 ng/ml), IL-10 (0.01-0.1 U/ml), or TGF-beta (0.01-1 ng/ml) to profoundly suppress LPS-stimulated release of TNF-alpha by whole blood and, to a lesser degree, THP-1 cells. Dex also suppressed spontaneous release of IL-1RA from PBMC and THP-1 cells, whereas IL-4 and IL-10, but not TGF-beta, stimulated release. Dex antagonized the enhanced release in IL-4 and IL-10-stimulated cultures. The capacity to stimulate release of IL-1RA may contribute to the anti-inflammatory potential of IL-4 and IL-10 in monocyte/macrophage-mediated disease. GC, therefore, do not uniquely enhance the suppressive functions of IL-4 and IL-10 on monokine activity.

Since previous data suggested that SN does not induce chemotaxis of neutrophils, we tested SN priming for respiratory burst activity, adherence to endothelial cell (EC) monolayers and effects on chemoattractant-stimulated migration of neutrophils. We found that priming of neutrophils with SN fails to enhance triggered respiratory burst activity or adherence to EC as compared to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), a well-known neutrophil-priming cytokine. Pretreatment, however, revealed an increase in spontaneous locomotion, and significant antagonism of formylpeptide (FMLP)-stimulated migration of neutrophils in modified Boyden chamber assays. The latter effect was similar to inhibition of FMLP-stimulated chemotaxis by TNF. The effects of SN on neutrophil migration could be abolished by an antiserum to SN, indicating its specificity.

The pathogenesis of this phenomenon is still not fully understood. To study if the decrease in hematopoiesis in HCL is accompanied by abnormal concentrations of growth factors, we investigated the production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin 3 (IL-3), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of eight patients with HCL. The results point to a severe deficiency of production of all cytokines tested as compared to healthy donors. However, enrichment of autologous monocytes by counterflow centrifugation resulted in a marked increase of the levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. The most pronounced effects were seen with IL-6. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicated that pokeweed mitogen, IFN-alpha, and poly(I:C) are capable of inducing the expression of IL-6-specific mRNA in HCL cells. These findings are substantiated on the protein level by immunofluorescence analysis. Incubation of PBMCs with IFN-alpha resulted in a significant increase of intracellular IL-6 in HCL but not in healthy donors. This increase was also seen in hairy cells positive for CD19 and CDllc. Furthermore, IFN-alpha induced the secretion of IL-6 from PBMCs of HCL patients but not healthy donors. In conclusion, our studies with PBMCs from patients with HCL revealed an inadequate supply of hematopoietic growth factors that might, in part, be due to the monocytopenia characteristic for this disease. The findings also indicate that IFN-alpha is capable of inducing the production of IL-6 in the patients' PBMCs as well as in their hairy cells.

Recent studies suggest that monocytic products, such as interleukin (IL)-1 beta, could stimulate IL-6 production by human gingival fibroblasts (HGF). In this context, the production of local cytokines and inflammatory mediators could regulate the secretory capacity of resident gingival fibroblasts. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if PGE2 induced by IL-1 beta could potentiate the IL-6 response by HGF. Utilizing an ELISA, it was determined that maximal IL-6 occurred when HGF were stimulated with 0.10-10 nM IL-1 beta. These concentrations of IL-1 beta also induced a small, but significant increase in PGE2 production by HGF. Interestingly, the combination of IL gamma beta and PGE2 induced a synergistic rise in IL-6 production by HGF. Moreover, inclusion of indomethacin caused a 20% reduction in IL-6 production and totally eliminated PGE2 production. These findings provide additional rationale for the clinical use of NSAIDs in the management of periodontal disease due to their ability to attenuate production of both PGE2, and IL-6. These results suggest the endogenous PGE2 induced by IL-1 beta plays an important regulatory role in IL 6 production by HGF.

Considerably higher concentrations of DSG are required to inhibit proliferative responses. In this in vitro study, the effects of DSG on CTL induction, on proliferative responses induced by different stimuli, and on the production of interleukins IL-1, IL-2 and IL-6 and IFN-gamma (gamma-interferon) were assessed and compared with the effects of CsA (cyclosporine A) and/or FK506. We confirmed the suppressive action of DSG on the generation of CTL. Quite unexpectedly, however, we found that, although DSG did not affect the proliferative response to allogeneic lymphocytes or a superantigen, it did inhibit proliferation of peripheral blood leucocytes (PBL) stimulated with Staphyloccus aureus. DSG was active even when added on day 2 of in vitro culture, suggesting that DSG does not inhibit early events. The fraction of CD3+ lymphoblasts and the CD4/CD8 ratio was lower in cells stimulated by S. aureus in the presence of DSG, showing a selective effect on CD3+CD4+ responder T lymphocytes. The proportion of IL-2 receptor (CD25) positive cells was also reduced by DSG treatment. Moreover, we found that DSG inhibited the proliferation induced by PHA (phytohaemagglutinin) but not by Con A (concanavalin A). This effect of DSG was time-dependent, since PHA induced proliferation was not affected until day 4 after stimulation, and indicated that DSG may inhibit proliferation induced via a CD2- but not via a CD3-mediated pathway. DSG did not influence the production of IL-2 or IFN-gamma or the lipopolysaccharide induced production of IL-2 or IL-6. In contrast, the production of IL-6 was inhibited when cells were stimulated by allogeneic lymphocytes, S. aureus, PHA or Con A. This suggested to us that the DSG-suppressed IL-6 production could be the basis for the other observed effects. We tried to mimic the DSG effects with antibodies and indeed found that the IL-6 specific antibodies had similar effects. Furthermore, recombinant IL-6 completely overcame the suppressive effects of DSG on S. aureus and PHA induced proliferation, whereas addition of IL-6 to DSG treated PBL only partly restored the cytotoxic activity of lymphoblasts induced by allogeneic cells. Thus, the inhibitory effect of DSG on de novo synthesis of IL-6 could explain some of its immunosuppressive effects, but additional DSG-sensitive steps are obviously involved in CTL induction and differentiation.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "A J", "last_name": "Borg", "initials": "AJ", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Immunology, Microbiology, Pathology and Infectious Diseases, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge Hospital, Sweden."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Kumagai-Braesch", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "E", "last_name": "M\u00f6ller", "initials": "E", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Transplant immunology", "issn": ["0966-3274"], "volume": "4", "issue": "2", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": "Jun", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8844778", "doi": "10.1016/0196-9781(96)00056-3", "title": "The brown Norway rats and the kinin system.", "abstract": "In 1979, we found a strain of kininogen-deficient Brown Norway rats.

Lewis rats were treated with: (a) a single intracardial injection of polyclonal rabbit anti-murine tumor necrosis factor antiserum prior to foot pad injection of 200 micrograms lipopolysaccharide; (b) an intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg pentoxifylline 1 hr before, at the time of, and 3 hr after foot pad injection of lipopolysaccharide; or (c) an intravitreal injection of 20 to 500 micrograms pentoxifylline together with 1 microgram lipopolysaccharide. The ocular inflammation was examined by slit-lamp and evaluated for the presence of hyperemia, flare, miosis, infiltrating cells or hypopyon. Levels of tumor necrosis factor in serum and aqueous samples were determined using a bioassay. Systemic treatment with either anti-tumor necrosis factor antibodies or pentoxifylline resulted in a significant inhibition, 90 and 70% respectively, of serum tumor necrosis factor activity at 3 to 4 hr after lipopolysaccharide injection. Systemic pentoxifylline treatment had no influence on the severity of uveitis. Anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody treatment, in contrast, caused an exacerbation of endotoxin-induced uveitis at t = 20 hr; mean uveitis score 3.9 vs. 1.4 in controls; P < 0.01. Intraocular administration of pentoxifylline together with lipopolysaccharide also had an aggravating effect on uveitis, that was associated with increased levels of intraocular tumor necrosis factor.

In this study, we examined the effects of interleukin-4 (IL-4), and its interactions with other cytokines and with parathyroid hormone (PTH), on mRNA levels of PGHS-2, PGHS-1, and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and on medium protaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in calvarial cultures. IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), both at 1-100 ng/ml, and PTH at 0.1-10 nM increased PGHS-2 and cPLA2 mRNA and medium PGE2 levels dose-dependently after 4 h of treatment. IL-6 and IL-11 at 1-100 ng/ml did not affect mRNA or PGE2 levels. IL-4 at 1-100 ng/ml decreased PGHS-2 and cPLA2 mRNA and PGE2 levels in control as well as IL-1, TNF-alpha, and PTH-stimulated cultures. The inhibition of PGHS-2 and cPLA2 mRNA expression by IL-4 (10 ng/ml) was present at 1 h, reached a maximum at 4 h, and persisted for 24 h. The effects were maintained in the presence of cycloheximide. IL-4 also decreased PGHS-2 protein levels in control and IL-1-stimulated cultures.

New approaches are being developed to further eliminate myeloma cells after an incomplete response achieved by transplantation or other chemotherapy. These approaches aim at myeloma cell surface antigens, T-cell immunity, and biological mechanisms of myeloma growth and dissemination. Biological targets include interleukin-6 (the central myeloma growth factor), interleukin-1 beta (an amplifier of stromal and bone cell production of interleukin-6), and serum soluble interleukin-6 receptor (an enhancer of myeloma cell response to interleukin-6). Efforts to eliminate circulating myeloma cells from peripheral blood stem cell harvests use positive selection or purging to provide a product that will engraft only normal stem cells, not myeloma cells. Multidrug resistance, a major factor in treatment failure, can be reversed by agents that inhibit the multidrug resistance protein on the myeloma cell surface. Finally, expanded knowledge of biologic mechanisms has led to the development of new prognostic factors.

The first signal is given by either of the soluble lymphokines, interleukin (IL)-4 or IL-13, which induce germline epsilon transcript expression, but this alone is insufficient to trigger secretion of immunoglobulin E (IgE). The second signal is provided by a physical interaction between B-cells and activated T-cells, basophils and mast cells, and it has been shown that the CD40/CD40 ligand (CD40L) pairing is crucial for mediating IgE synthesis. In hyper-immunoglobulin M1 (HIGM1) syndrome, which is characterized by greatly decreased levels of immunoglobulin G, A and E (IgG, IgA and IgE), there are mutations in the CD40L resulting in a completely non-functional extracellular domain. The CD40L is, therefore, playing a central role in immunoglobulin isotype switching. Amongst the numerous pairs of surface adhesion molecules, the CD23-CD21 pair seems to play a key role in the generation of IgE. The CD23 molecule is positively and negatively regulated by factors which increase or decrease IgE production, respectively. Antibodies to CD23 have been shown to inhibit IL-4-induced human IgE production in vitro and to inhibit antigen-specific IgE responses in a rat model, in an isotype selective manner. CD23 interacts with CD21 on B-cells, preferentially driving IgE production. CD23 recognizes two main epitopes on the CD21 molecule. One region consists of short consensus repeat (SCR) sequences 1-2 and the other of SCR 5-8. In the latter region, Asn 370 and 295 are critical in the interaction with the lectin CD23.

This study compares changes in the phenotype of cultured Schwann cells after exposure to the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or the mitogen neu differentiation factor (NDF)-beta. TNF alpha inhibited proliferation in a dose-dependent manner without altering Schwann cell survival. TNF alpha also reduced both gap junctional conductance and Lucifer yellow dye coupling between Schwann cells. Moreover, both Po and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity were reduced. By contrast, NDF beta initially had little effect on cell division although it reduced junctional coupling within 8 h. However, by 48 h, NDF beta stimulated proliferation with a concomitant increase in coupling. Dividing Schwann cells (BrdU+) were preferentially dye coupled compared to nondividing cells, indicating an association between proliferation and coupling. Moreover, cultured Schwann cells expressed connexin46 mRNA and protein, and changes in the levels of the protein correlated with the degree of proliferation and coupling. The data thus provide evidence for cytokine-induced modulation of Schwann cell antigenic phenotype, proliferation, and gap junction properties.

An immuno-neutralization strategy was employed to investigate the role of endogenous lipocortin 1 (LC1) in acute inflammation in the mouse. 2. Mice were treated subcutaneously with phosphate-buffered solution (PBS), non-immune sheep serum (NSS) or with one of two sheep antisera raised against LC1 (LCS3), or its N-terminal peptide (LCPS1), three times over a period of seven days. Twenty four hours after the last injection several parameters of acute inflammation were measured including zymosan-induced inflammation in 6-day-old air-pouches, zymosan-activated serum (ZAS)-induced oedema in the skin, platelet-activating factor (PAF)-induced neutrophilia and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta)-induced corticosterone (CCS) release. 3. At the 4 h time-point of the zymosan inflamed air-pouch model, treatment with LCS3 did not modify the number of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) recruited: 7.84 +/- 1.01 and 7.00 +/- 0.77 x 10(6) PMN per mouse for NSS- and LCS3 group, n = 7. However, several other parameters of cell activation including myeloperoxidase (MPO) and elastase activities were increased (2.2 fold, P < 0.05, and 6.5 fold, P < 0.05, respectively) in the lavage fluids of these mice. Similarly, a significant increase in the amount of immunoreactive prostaglandin E2 (PGE2; 1.81 fold, P < 0.05) and IL-1 alpha (2.75 fold, P < 0.05), but not tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), was also observed in LCS3-treated mice. 4. The recruitment of PMN into the zymosan inflamed air-pouches by 24 h had declined substantially (4.13 +/- 0.61 x 10(6) PMN per mouse, n = 12) in the NSS-treated mice, whereas high values were still measured in those treated with LCS3 (9.35 +/- 1.20 x 10(6) PMN per mouse, n = 12, P < 0.05). A similar effect was also found following sub-chronic treatment of mice with LCPS1: 6.48 +/- 0.10 x 10(6) PMN per mouse, vs. 2.77 +/- 1.20 and 2.64 +/- 0.49 x 10(6) PMN per mouse for PBS- and NSS-treated groups (n = 7, P < 0.05). Most markers of inflammation were also increased in the lavage fluids of LCS3-treated mice: MPO and elastase showed a 2.47 fold and 17 fold increase, respectively (P < 0.05 in both cases); TNF-alpha showed a 11.1 fold increase (P < 0.05) whereas the IL-1 alpha levels were not significantly modified. PGE2 was still detectable in most (5 out of 7) of the mice treated with LCS3 but only in 2 out of 7 of the NSS-treated mice. 5. Intradermal injection of 50% ZAS caused a significant increase in the 2 hoedema formation in the skin of LCS3-treated mice in comparison to PBS- and NSS-treated animals: 16.7 +/- 1.5 microliters vs. 10.8 +/- 1.2 microliters and 10.2 +/- 1.0 microliters, respectively (n = 14 mice per group, P < 0.05). ZAS-induced oedema had subsided by 24 h in control animals but a residual significant amount of extravasation was still detectable in LCS3-treated mice: 4.4 +/- 0.8 microliters (P < 0.05). 6. A recently described model driven by endogenous glucocorticoids is the blood neutrophilia observed following administration of PAF. In our experimental conditions, a single bolus of PAF (100 ng, i.v.) provoked a marked neutrophilia at 2 h (2.43 and 2.01 fold) in NSS- and PBS-treated mice (n = 11), respectively, which was significantly attenuated in the animals treated with LCS3: 1.26 fold increase in circulating PMN (n = 11, P < 0.01 vs. NSS- and PBS-groups). 7. Intraperitoneal injection of IL-1 beta (5 micrograms kg-1) caused a marked increase in circulating plasma CCS by 2 h, to a similar extent in all experimental groups. In contrast, measurement of CCS levels in the plasma of mice bearing air-pouches inflamed with zymosan revealed significant differences between LCS3 and NSS-treated mice at the 4 h time-point: 198 +/- 26 ng ml-1 vs. 110 +/- 31 ng ml-1 (n = 8, P < 0.05). 8.

Recent studies have demonstrated that ligand-induced activation of both GH and PRL receptors leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple intracellular proteins by the identical non-receptor tyrosine kinase, JAK2. We have shown previously that in vivo administration of human recombinant GH rapidly stimulated the inducible transcription factors, Stats1, 3, and 5, and acutely altered gene transcription in the liver. Because human GH can bind to both lactogenic and somatogenic receptors with high affinity, in this study we have addressed the question of specificity of the hormonal response by examining the early nuclear events following a single injection of rat GH or rat PRL to hormone-deficient hypophysectomized female rats. We find that PRL stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5, induced nuclear protein binding to the GH-responsive element of the serine protease inhibitor (Spi) 2.1 promoter, and activated Spi 2.1 gene expression. These acute actions of rat PRL were modest compared to the effects of rat GH. GH treatment induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several hepatic nuclear proteins, activated Stats1, 3, and 5, stimulated Spi 2.1 gene expression, and inhibited albumin gene transcription. All of the effects of rat GH paralleled responses to human GH that we have measured previously. Based on these results, it is likely that most of the actions of human GH in the liver are mediated by the GH receptor rather than by the PRL receptor. The diminished response to PRL may be secondary to the high density of short PRL receptor isoforms in the liver, which do not participate effectively in ligand-induced signal transmission.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "C", "last_name": "Le Stunff", "initials": "C", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO 63110, USA."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A M", "last_name": "Gronowski", "initials": "AM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "P", "last_name": "Rotwein", "initials": "P", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Molecular and cellular endocrinology", "issn": ["0303-7207"], "volume": "121", "issue": "2", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": "Aug", "pub_day": "09"}}, {"pmid": "8892341", "doi": "10.1016/0197-4580(96)00114-5", "title": "Molecular aspects of inflammatory and immune responses in Alzheimer's disease.", "abstract": "Recent advances indicate numerous molecular and cellular elements of the immune system are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): In vivo IL-6 messenger RNA expression by Northern analysis and in vitro endometrial IL-6 protein production by assay of the conditioned media. RESULT(S): Midsecretory and late secretory phase endometria expressed more IL-6 messenger RNA than late proliferative phase endometria in vivo. Similarly in vitro, in pg/mg endometrium per hour secretory endometria IL-6 protein production, 25.7 +/- 7.1 (mean +/- SEM), exceeded that of proliferative endometria, 4.7 +/- 1.0. With IL-1 beta treatment, secretory endometria IL-6 protein production exceeded that of proliferative endometria. Interleukin-1 beta stimulated endometrial IL-6 protein production in time- and dose-dependent manners.

Because IL-6 signal can be transduced when the complex of IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) binds to gp 130, an IL-6 signal transducer, we studied the effects of IL-6 and sIL-6R on thyroid function, using human thyroid follicles obtained from patients with Graves' disease. IL-6 alone had no inhibitory effect on TSH-induced thyroid function (125I incorporation and organic 125I release), even at supraphysiological concentrations. However, in the presence of physiological concentrations of sIL-6R (100 ng/ml), IL-6 inhibited thyroid function dose dependently and completely, accompanied with the decreased ratio of 125I-T3/125I-T4 not only in the thyroid follicles but also in the culture medium. Thyroid follicles did not secrete sIL-6R but produced IL-6 constitutively. Consistent with these findings, sIL-6R inhibited thyroid function slightly at high concentrations. Furthermore, RT-PCR analyses revealed that human thyroid follicles expressed the messenger RNAs for IL-6 and gp130 but scarcely messenger RNA for IL-6R. These in vitro findings suggest that IL-6 alone hardly affects thyroid function in thyroid follicles in which IL-6R gene is scarcely expressed. However, because sIL-6R is present abundantly in serum, IL-6 in vivo would be capable of inhibiting the synthesis and release of T4 and, to a greater extent, T3 from the thyroid gland.

ANIMALS: 20 adult, skeletally normal, hound-type dogs. PROCEDURE: Dogs (20 to 30 kg) were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 groups. One group served as untreated controls. Bivalve casts were placed on the left hind limbs of the remaining 16 dogs to limit weightbearing and motion of the limb for 92 days. One group served as the cast control. Beginning on day 56, 3 groups received aseptic intra-articular injections in the left stifles of either 5 mg of HA or 5 mg of HA containing either 20 or 50 micrograms of TGF-beta. Intraarticular injections were repeated at 4-day intervals until the end of the study. Or day 92, stifles were harvested at necroscropy. Medial femoral condyle were histologically processed, and the articular cartilage was stained for the presence of proteoglycans, stromelysin, tumor necrosis facto (TNF) alpha, and TNF receptors (p55 and p75). RESULTS: Decreased metachromasia was evident in the cartilage matrix of all cast groups, with the smallest decrease in the HA-treated group. Stromelysin was immunolocalized in articular cartilage of the cast (left) limbs of cast control and both HA/TGF-beta-treated groups. TNF-alpha was localized in articular cartilage of all cast (left) and right limbs, except those of the HA-treated group. Receptors for TNF were observed in both limbs of untreated control and cast control groups and cast limbs of HA/TGF-3-treated groups. The receptors were not localized in the right limbs of the HA with or without TGF-beta-treated groups. TGF-beta did not decrease stromelysin or TNF-alpha or receptors at the doses used. CONCLUSIONS: HA may mediate a chondrostabilizing influence on articular cartilage by down-regulating TNF-alpha importantly.

In vitro, neuropeptide gene expression is similarly increased by exposure to the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1). The effect of IL-1 in-vitro has been shown to be mediated by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Since IL-1 regulates neuropeptide expression via LIF in vitro, we asked whether axotomy in vivo produces an increase in LIF mRNA, and whether that increase is regulated by IL-1 activity. Within 6 h following axotomy, ganglionic LIF mRNA is substantially elevated. Moreover, axotomy produces a rapid and transient increase in intraganglionic IL-1 beta mRNA, followed rapidly by an increase in ICAM-1 mRNA, thereby suggesting a local source of IL-1 activity. Pretreatment with the anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone (DEX) reduces the increases of both IL-1 beta and LIF mRNAs following axotomy. mRNA encoding the specific signal-transducing Type I IL-1 receptor is present in unlesioned SCG in vivo, and increases following axotomy. Local application of IL-1 beta in vivo induces LIF mRNA even in uninjured ganglia, though not to the extent seen with axotomy. DEX treatment blocks this IL-1 beta-mediated increase in LIF mRNA. Therefore, DEX blocks the induction of LIF mRNA by inhibiting both the production of IL-1 and its action on LIF gene expression. Axotomy of a homozygous IL-1 receptor type I gene knockout mouse leads to a delayed and/or diminished induction of LIF mRNA in SCG, but does not prevent LIF mRNA expression. We conclude that while IL-1 is likely to be involved in the cascade of gene expression that follows axotomy, it alone is not sufficient to mediate the full induction of LIF mRNA by axotomy.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "C D", "last_name": "Carlson", "initials": "CD", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ 07102, USA."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "Y", "last_name": "Bai", "initials": "Y", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Ding", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "G M", "last_name": "Jonakait", "initials": "GM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "R P", "last_name": "Hart", "initials": "RP", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Journal of neuroimmunology", "issn": ["0165-5728"], "volume": "70", "issue": "2", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": "Nov", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8898728", "doi": "10.1016/s0165-5728(96)00116-6", "title": "Intracellular signaling of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in brain microvascular endothelial cells is mediated by a protein tyrosine kinase and protein kinase C-dependent pathway.", "abstract": "The intracellular signaling pathways responsible for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha stimulation of lymphocyte adhesion to brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) were studied using inhibitors of protein kinase C (bisindolylmaleimide HCl, H-7, or staurosporine), or protein tyrosine kinase (genistein).

The present study was designed to investigate whether Kupffer cell-derived mediators alter the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation of hepatocytes in the endotoxemic condition. Liver cells were isolated from male Wistar rats. Oxidative phosphorylation was monitored as the fluorescence of rhodamine 123 (Rh123), which is the fluorescent cationic dye used to indicate mitochondrial energy synthesis. Two hours after coculture of hepatocytes with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-pretreated Kupffer cells, a marked decrease in hepatocyte rhodamine 123 fluorescence was observed. The hepatocyte mitochondrial dysfunction was attenuated by the addition of either N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), an inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, or aminoguanidine, an inducible-type of NO synthase inhibitor, to the culture medium of cocultures, to the pretreatment of LPS-activated Kupffer cells with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides against iNOS messenger RNA (mRNA), or to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) mRNA. Four hours after the coculture, hepatocyte Rh123 fluorescence further decreased, and an iNOS induction as well as an increased NO production were observed in hepatocytes that were cocultured with LPS-pretreated Kupffer cells. The membrane barrier dysfunction of hepatocytes, indicated by propidium iodide staining, was also induced by a 4-hour coculture with LPS-pretreated Kupffer cells. These late-phase changes were inhibited either by the pretreatment of hepatocytes with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides against iNOS mRNA or by treatments that are effective in the early phase (within 2 hours). Incubation with recombinant rat TNF-alpha decreased hepatocyte Rh123 fluorescence within 2 hours. Thus, the present study suggests that NO and TNF-alpha released from LPS-pretreated Kupffer cells directly inhibit the hepatocyte mitochondrial function in the early phase, and then NO synthesized by TNF-alpha-induced hepatocyte iNOS causes lethal hepatocyte injury, characterized by diminished mitochondrial energization and membrane barrier function in the late phase.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "I", "last_name": "Kurose", "initials": "I", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S", "last_name": "Miura", "initials": "S", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "H", "last_name": "Higuchi", "initials": "H", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "N", "last_name": "Watanabe", "initials": "N", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "Y", "last_name": "Kamegaya", "initials": "Y", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Takaishi", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "K", "last_name": "Tomita", "initials": "K", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "D", "last_name": "Fukumura", "initials": "D", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S", "last_name": "Kato", "initials": "S", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "H", "last_name": "Ishii", "initials": "H", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)", "issn": ["0270-9139"], "volume": "24", "issue": "5", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": "Nov", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8910439", "doi": "10.1074/jbc.271.45.28220", "title": "Induction of vascular endothelial growth factor by tumor necrosis factor alpha in human glioma cells.

VEGF expression appears to be highly susceptible to hypoxia or exogenous cytokines and growth factors. Of various cytokines and growth factors, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin 1 most potently enhanced VEGF mRNA levels of a glioma cell line, U251. Incubation of the glioma cells with bFGF or TNF-alpha increased both VEGF and SP-1 mRNA at 30 min and c-Fos mRNA at 1-3 h, over 5-fold. Nuclear run-on assays showed an apparent increase of the transcription of the VEGF gene as well as the SP-1 gene by bFGF or TNF-alpha. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that only SP-1 binding activity was increased 1 h after exposure to bFGF or TNF-alpha, and also that AP-1, but not SP-1, activity was significantly activated by hypoxia. Mithramycin, an inhibitor of SP-1, at 1-10 nM inhibited activation of the VEGF gene by bFGF or TNF-alpha but not that by hypoxia. Western blot analysis also demonstrated an increase in cellular amounts of VEGF by TNF-alpha and a decrease by co-administration with mithramycin. The promoter activity of the VEGF gene, which contains five SP-1 binding sites and one AP-1 binding site but not hypoxia regulatory elements, was enhanced by bFGF or TNF-alpha but not by hypoxia. The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay with VEGF promoter deletion constructs demonstrated that four clusterized SP-1 binding sites in the proximal promoter were essential for the basal transcription and the TNF-alpha-dependent activation.

Recent evidence has implicated activation of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of signaling proteins in pancreatic carcinoma during cytokine-induced cytostasis and differentiation. METHODS: A human pancreatic adenocarcinoma (HPAC) cell line was exposed to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha; 40 ng/ml) for 6 days. Cytostasis and viability were confirmed by daily MTT [(3(4,5)-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide] and trypan exclusion assay. Protein fractions were isolated daily and subjected to immunoblot analysis for the normal (terminally differentiated) pancreatic ductal cell marker carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) as well as specific PKC isoforms (alpha, beta, gamma, eta, and zeta). RESULTS: Growth arrest occurred in HPAC cells after exposure to TNF-alpha for 48 h, with viability maintained above 90% throughout the 6-day time course. CA II immunoreactivity was not detected in untreated controls but appeared after 2 days of TNF-alpha exposure, peaking on day 6. Concurrently, TNF-alpha induced the selective downregulation of PKC-alpha, whereas PKC-gamma levels increased. PKC-beta and PKC-eta immunoreactivity did not change. The atypical PKC-zeta isoform developed a doublet banding pattern in response to TNF-alpha, although overall PKC-zeta levels did not change.

Overall, these data lend support to a \"plastic\" model of bone marrow stromal cell differentiation; adipocytes may share common functions with stromal stem cells, osteoblasts, and hematopoietic supportive cells.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "J M", "last_name": "Gimble", "initials": "JM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Immunobiology and Cancer Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City 73104, USA. gimble@omrf.uokhsc"], "emails": ["gimble@omrf.uokhsc"]}, {"fore_name": "C E", "last_name": "Robinson", "initials": "CE", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "X", "last_name": "Wu", "initials": "X", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "K A", "last_name": "Kelly", "initials": "KA", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Bone", "issn": ["8756-3282"], "volume": "19", "issue": "5", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": "Nov", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8922659", "doi": "10.1016/s8756-3282(96)90162-3", "title": "European and North American Experience with HRT for the prevention of osteoporosis.", "abstract": "Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been the method of choice for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis since the early 1990s. Although a number of routes of administration are now available, HRT is still predominantly administered orally. In the United States, HRT formulations traditionally comprise conjugated equine estrogens. In Europe, however, HRT preparations tend to be based on 17 beta-estradiol, a natural human estrogen. Furthermore, distinct patterns of HRT use are apparent based on the age of the woman receiving it. Current recommendations are that early postmenopausal women (in their early 50s) receive sequential combined estrogen/progestogen therapy with continued monthly bleeds, while in women who are at least 1 year postmenopausal, continuous combined HRT, which leads to endometrial atrophy and cessation of monthly bleeding, is preferred. Clinical experience to date clearly demonstrates that long-term HRT unequivocally increases bone mass and reduces the risk of fractures in postmenopausal women, with no significant differences between sequential and continuous combined prescribing regimens. Data demonstrating that antiestrogens such as tamoxifen may preserve bone mass have led to the initiation of large-scale trials to determine the potential clinical utility of such agents for the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Nonhormonal therapeutic approaches are now also available, most notably bisphosphonates and vitamin D analogs. At present, however, traditional HRT remains the regimen of choice for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, given its additional beneficial effects on acute menopausal symptoms, as well as on the cardiovascular system and brain.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "E F", "last_name": "Eriksen", "initials": "EF", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["University Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Arhus Amtssygehus, Denmark."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Kassem", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "B", "last_name": "Langdahl", "initials": "B", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Bone", "issn": ["8756-3282"], "volume": "19", "issue": "5 Suppl", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": "Nov", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8928089", "doi": "10.1016/0049-3848(96)00003-5", "title": "TNF-alpha suppresses IL-6 upregulation of protein S in HepG-2 hepatoma cells.", "abstract": "The pathogenesis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has, in part, been attributed to the impairment of the natural anticoagulant protein C/protein S pathway.

We have developed an ex vivo method using whole blood for analysis of IL-1 antagonists administered in vivo to the monkeys and report here results for the naturally occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-1ra. In this procedure, animals are given an i.v. infusion of IL-1ra, and blood samples are taken preinfusion and during the infusion.

In addition, because we had observed previously that END stimulated the secretion of prostaglandin E2 from cultured porcine AP cells, the effects of the inhibition of END-stimulated cyclooxygenase products on IL-6 mRNA abundance and the secretion of IL-6 were evaluated. In the first experiment, RNA was extracted from cultured pig AP cells that had been treated with END for 0.5 or 1 hr and subjected to reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction and hybridization after Southern transfer. Bands of expected amplified product size, corresponding to IL-6, were observed only from cells treated with END, although specific hybridization was observed from both control and END-treated wells.

Finally, using immunostaining, we confirmed the presence of CD14, an END receptor, in cultured pig AP cells. These studies clearly establish the presence of IL-6 mRNA and secretion of the cytokine from cultured porcine AP cells. In addition, END stimulates the secretion of IL-6, perhaps through cells expressing CD14, and END-stimulated IL-6 secretion appears to be mediated by products of the cyclooxygenase pathway.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "E J", "last_name": "Abraham", "initials": "EJ", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Animal Sciences and Industry, Kansas State University, Manhattan 66506-0201, USA."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "R D", "last_name": "Oberst", "initials": "RD", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M P", "last_name": "Hays", "initials": "MP", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S K", "last_name": "Chapes", "initials": "SK", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J E", "last_name": "Minton", "initials": "JE", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Domestic animal endocrinology", "issn": ["0739-7240"], "volume": "13", "issue": "6", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": "Nov", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8961238", "doi": "10.1016/s0306-9877(96)90153-x", "title": "The role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the pathogenesis of anorexia and bulimia nervosa, cancer cachexia and obesity.", "abstract": "In this paper a new immunological model of anorexia and bulimia nervosa will be presented in which the inflammatory cytokines are conceived as the fundamental regulators of body metabolism. This conception differs from the conventional view in which the inflammatory cytokines are perceived primarily as peptide molecules utilized by the immune system to control infection, inflammation and tissue or neuronal damage. Given that the inflammatory cytokines are also fundamental regulators of body metabolism, when they become dysregulated they create physiological chaos which results in the development of a number of autoimmune, metabolic and psychiatric disorders. In this proposed immunological model of anorexia and bulimia nervosa, elevated tumor necrosis factor-alpha features as the primary cause of these conditions. Pathophysiological parallels are drawn between anorexia nervosa and cancer cachexia in terms of the causal role the cytokines, neuropeptides and neurotransmitters play in the manifestation of shared symptoms. These shared symptoms include elevated tumour necrosis factor-alpha, down-regulated interleukin-2 and interleukin-4 and depletion of lean body mass. Furthermore, the following neuropeptides are dysregulated in both anorexia nervosa and cancer cachexia: vasoactive intestinal peptide, cholecystokinin, corticotropin-releasing factor, neuropeptide Y, peptide YY and beta-endorphin. In addition, in anorexia and bulimia nervosa, secretion of the neurotransmitter serotonin is inhibited while norepinephrine is enhanced. It will be argued that the causal interplay between the cytokines, neuropeptides and neurotransmitters initiates a cascade of biochemical events which may result in either anorexia or bulimia nervosa, or cancer cachexia. The extent to which these inflammatory cytokines, neuropeptides and neurotransmitters are causally efficacious in the pathogenesis of other autoimmune disorders, such as diabetes mellitus and rheumatoid arthritis, will also be addressed.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "R J", "last_name": "Holden", "initials": "RJ", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Medical Research Unit, University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "I S", "last_name": "Pakula", "initials": "IS", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Medical hypotheses", "issn": ["0306-9877"], "volume": "47", "issue": "6", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": "Dec", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8964902", "doi": "10.1016/0165-5728(95)00163-8", "title": "Substance P receptor antagonist inhibits murine IgM expression in developing schistosome granulomas by blocking the terminal differentiation of intragranuloma B cells.", "abstract": "Schistosome granulomas make substance P (SP).

Animals received CP96,345 (50 mg/kg/day) for 4 days following egg embolization. Then granulomas were isolated from tissue and dispersed into single-cell preparations. The dispersed granuloma cells were cultured in vitro to measure IgM and cytokine secretion. Also, granuloma B cells were studied using an IgM ELISPOT assay and flow cytometry. As expected, mice treated with CP96,345 formed granulomas that secreted little IgM. Granulomas from CP96,345-treated mice, as compared to buffer-treated animals, contained few IgM-secreting B lymphocytes, but had appropriate numbers of B cells expressing surface IgM. Also decreased was the capacity of the granulomas to make IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6. CP96,345 treatment did not affect splenocyte IgM or cytokine synthesis.

Moreover, morphine inhibited expression of TNF-alpha mRNA in BALB/3T3 cells (IC50, 1.6 mM), but not expression of early response genes.

NS1 was significantly produced in the three transfectant cells in an inducer dose- and time-dependent manner. Surprisingly, these three transfectants secreted an inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), in response to induction. However, no production of other related cytokines, IL-1beta, IL-8, or tumor necrosis factor alpha, was seen. Moreover, NS1-primed IL-6 induction was transiently demonstrated in primary human endothelial cells. Analysis with luciferase reporter plasmids carrying IL-6 promoter mutant fragments demonstrated that NS1 effect is mediated by a NF-kappaB binding site in the IL-6 promoter region, strongly implying that NS1 functions as a trans-acting transcriptional activator on the IL-6 promoter. Our novel finding, IL-6 induction by NS1, supports the possible relationship between parvovirus B19 infection and polyclonal activation of B cells in rheumatoid arthritis and indicates that NS1 protein may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of some B19-associated diseases by modulating the expression of host cellular genes.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "S", "last_name": "Moffatt", "initials": "S", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Microbiology, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "N", "last_name": "Tanaka", "initials": "N", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "K", "last_name": "Tada", "initials": "K", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Nose", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Nakamura", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "O", "last_name": "Muraoka", "initials": "O", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "T", "last_name": "Hirano", "initials": "T", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "K", "last_name": "Sugamura", "initials": "K", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Journal of virology", "issn": ["0022-538X"], "volume": "70", "issue": "12", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": "Dec", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8971476", "doi": "10.1016/s1359-6101(96)00032-9", "title": "Suicide by order: some open questions about the cell-killing activities of the TNF ligand and receptor families.", "abstract": "That leukocytes can produce proteins with cell-killing activities has been known for almost 30 years (Granger GA, Kolb EP.

However, it is only recently that the nature of this cell killing activity has become clear. What appeared initially to be merely a toxic effect of the leukocyte-produced proteins (hence their initial name, 'lymphotoxins') has turned out to represent a new kind of biological mechanism, whose understanding required a radical change of concepts concerning the ways in which the life and death of the cell are controlled. The leukocyte-produced 'toxic' proteins turned out to act, not through any toxic feature of the proteins themselves, but by activating destructive mechanisms that pre-exist within the target cell. Their action thus represents a way by which one cell can dictate suicide to another. Within the last few years more has been learnt about their mechanisms of action than was learnt throughout the two preceding decades. Nevertheless, many questions still remain unresolved.

The adhesion of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) to porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) was thus studied in an in vitro porcine-to-human xenogeneic model. It was found that 25.9% of human PBL adhered to resting PAEC. Furthermore, this adhesion increased significantly when the PAEC were stimulated by the human cytokine TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor-alpha). The effect of human TNF-alpha was concentration- and time-dependent and was maximal (from 25.9% to 35.6%) with 100 U/ml during 6 h. Moreover, blocking experiments with monoclonal antibody (mAb) demonstrated the role of the PBL adhesion molecules LFA-1 and especially VLA-4. Indeed, an anti-CD11a mAb decreased PBL adhesion to resting PAEC by 17.1% and to TNF-alpha stimulated PAEC by 16.9%, whereas an anti-CD49d mAb decreased dramatically PBL adhesion to resting PAEC by 53.1% and to TNF-alpha stimulated PAEC by 41.0%. Finally, phenotypic analysis of the adherent PBL showed that 50.5% of adherent cells to resting PAEC were NK (natural killer) cells, whereas 50.7% of adherent cells to TNF-alpha stimulated PAEC were T lymphocytes, showing the preferential adhesion of NK cells to resting PAEC, and that the stimulation of the PAEC with human TNF-alpha affects predominantly T lymphocyte adhesion.

This effect was now investigated more closely under various endotoxin conditions in order to dissect effects of bacteria and endotoxin: (A) bacteria-rich conditions (without penicillin/streptomycin [P/S] and without LPS), (B) LPS-enriched conditions (with P/S and with LPS), and (C) bacteria-free conditions (with P/S and without LPS). Under bacteria-rich conditions, norepinephrine (Emax = 10(-6) M, p = 0.012) and isoproterenol (Emax = 10(-6) M, p = 0.048) concentration-dependently inhibited IL-6 secretion from murine spleen slices in contrast to bacteria-free conditions. In a bacteria-free environment the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol did not attenuate the electrically induced inhibition of splenic IL-6 secretion.

In order to test this concept and to establish a foundation for the role of inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of gram-negative bacterial infections in the respiratory tract of animals, the patterns of inflammatory cytokine expression were determined in experimental porcine pleuropneumonia. We observed that IL-1 and IL-6, but not TNF, were rapidly and dramatically elevated in the lavage fluid of the lung within 24 h of infection. The increased levels of IL-1 might contribute to increased severity of disease, but elevated IL-6 levels were consistent with a protective acute phase response. Additional studies were performed to examine the hypothesis that IL-4 expression later in infection might be involved in turning off the inflammatory response and promoting an antigen-specific humoral immune response. Interleukin-4 efficiently suppressed inflammatory cytokine production in alveolar macrophages. Its expression was induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by TNF, IL-4, and by reexposure to a specific antigen. To obtain the maximum amount of information on the role of inflammatory cytokines in animals of veterinary significance it will be useful to perform studies in species such that evolutionary relatedness will allow widespread application of the findings. Furthermore, the variety of molecules involved in inflammatory cytokine regulation will require much more extensive investigations of the relevant enzymes, inhibitors and receptors in veterinary species.

Because IL-12 induces production of TNF-alpha by certain cells of the immune system, we sought to determine whether UVB is an inducer of IL-12 gene expression in epidermal cells. Human epidermal cells were exposed to UVB radiation in vivo, isolated by suction blister technique and trypsinization and transcription of the IL-12 p35 and p40 chains was examined by RT-PCR. We found the p35 chain of IL-12 to be constitutively expressed and the p40 chain inducible by UVB irradiation. Because epidermis consists of a heterogenous cell population with distinct cytokine repertoires, we sought to determine the cellular source of the IL-12 message after UVB exposure. After depleting UVB-exposed epidermal cells for DR+ cells, no reduction in the IL-12 activity was detected, suggesting that keratinocytes are a source of IL-12 transcripts in UVB-exposed human epidermis. This was supported by the up-regulation of IL-12 p40 transcripts in UV-irradiated cultured keratinocytes that were devoid of DR+ cells. Up-regulation of IL-12 p40 gene expression by UVB as demonstrated here, taken together with the finding that keratinocytes also up-regulate IL-10 transcription, suggests that there is a complex interplay between Th1- and Th2-like epidermis-derived cytokines following exposure to UVB.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "C D", "last_name": "Enk", "initials": "CD", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Dermatology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-1908, USA."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S", "last_name": "Mahanty", "initials": "S", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A", "last_name": "Blauvelt", "initials": "A", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S I", "last_name": "Katz", "initials": "SI", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Photochemistry and photobiology", "issn": ["0031-8655"], "volume": "63", "issue": "6", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": "Jun", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "8994869", "doi": "10.1016/s0952-7915(96)80018-5", "title": "Cytokines in autoimmunity.", "abstract": "The past few years have witnessed exciting developments regarding the role of cytokines in autoimmune diseases, particularly in rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease, with the demonstration that anti-TNF alpha therapy is clinically beneficial and provides reproducible results.

Excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines was shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of RA. From different studies testing either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, it could be concluded that both drugs differentially inhibit cytokine production. METHODS: We compared the effects of both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with respect to cytokine production. Therefore, PBMC were tested for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by specific ELISA, after stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence or absence of different concentrations of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. RESULTS: We observed that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine equally inhibit PHA induced TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma production, and LPS induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 production, while PHA induced IL-6 production was not affected.

However, unlike IL-9 and SCF, IL-6 and TNF-alpha did not promote the growth of mast cells already developed. Macrophage may be one of the responsive cells of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in the cultures, because removal of macrophages greatly reduced the mast cell development induced by the cytokines. The actions of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were inhibited by indomethacin, an inhibitor for prostaglandin synthesis, and by neutralizing anti-IFN-gamma and anti-IL-3 antibodies. rIL-4, when added at the start of the culture, also inhibited mast cell development induced by rIL-6 and rTNF-alpha. Nevertheless, neutralizing anti-IL-6 and anti-TNF-alpha antibodies did not suppress mast cell development induced by PGE and IFN-gamma. TNF-alpha and IL-6 enhanced IFN-gamma production, but suppressed IL-4 production in the cultures.

We have now studied whether these cytokines can inhibit JMML cell cytokine production, thereby potentially reducing the malignant cell load in this disorder. We found that IL-10, but not IL-4 or IL-13, dose dependently inhibited JMML cell production of the hemopoietic growth factors granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and IL-1beta. Similarly, IL-10, but not IL-4 or IL-13, suppressed JMML colony formation and cell viability. This was not due to the absence of receptors because we could detect mRNAs for the IL-4 and the IL-13 receptor alpha subunits and the IL-2 common gamma subunit in JMML cells. Furthermore, the receptors were active since both IL-4 and IL-13 up-regulated surface expression of MHC class II and down-regulated CD14 antigens on JMML cells and monocytes. Unlike activated monocytes, the JMML cells did not produce IL-10. It is suggested that the loss of cytokine inhibitory effects of IL-4 and IL-13 could play a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder.

If TNF alpha was abnormally increased in preeclamptic placentas, it might contribute to the increased oxidative stress and the formation of lipid peroxides. We hypothesized that TNF alpha levels would be higher in preeclamptic than in normal placentas. We determined: (1) the levels of TNF alpha protein in whole placental tissue; (2) the concentrations of TNF alpha protein and lipid peroxides in the medium after 48 h of incubation of whole placental villi; (3) mRNA expression of TNF alpha. Placental TNF alpha protein levels were measured by ELISA, lipid peroxides by a spectrophotometric method specific for peroxides, and TNF alpha mRNA expression by RT-PCR. RESULTS: (1) TNF alpha tissue levels were significantly higher in preeclamptic than in normal placentas, P < 0.05. (2) Concentrations of both TNF alpha and lipid peroxides were higher in the incubation medium of preeclamptic than normal placentas, P < 0.05.

Several investigations have suggested that one of the mechanisms through which estrogen prevents bone loss was a modulation on secretion or release of various cytokines that are known to influence bone remodeling, even if some recent data have challenged this hypothesis. However, in established osteoporosis, the possibility that enhanced cytokines activity may account for the progression of this disease remains unclear and controversial. We sought here to determine whether production of IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, GM-CSF and LIF, after direct stimulation in whole blood, was different in healthy (n = 30) or osteoporotic postmenopausal women (n = 24) and whether lumbar bone density (1-BMD) correlated with the values of cytokine production observed in these conditions. A significant difference was observed between the osteoporotic and control subjects for IL-1 beta (p < 0.0001), IL-6 (p < 0.001) and TNF-alpha (p = 0.027) productions, the values being higher in the osteoporotic women. No significant differences between the groups were observed for IFN-gamma (p = 0.51), GM-CSF (p = 0.70) or LIF (p = 0.97). In the whole population, statistically significant negative correlations were observed between lumbar BMD and IL-1 beta (r = -0.46) (p < 0.0005), IL-6 (r = -0.50) (p < 0.0001) and TNF-alpha (r = -0.39) (p < 0.005) production while no such correlations were observed for IFN-gamma, GM-CSF or LIF. In conclusion, the study of cytokine production by immune cells cultured in autologous whole blood suggests that in women more than 10 years past the menopause and presenting a decrease in lumbar bone density corresponding to the new WHO definition of \"osteoporosis', production of IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha is still increased compared to controls matched for age and ovarian function, while no differences are reported for IFN-gamma, GM-CSF or LIF production.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "S X", "last_name": "Zheng", "initials": "SX", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Center for Investigation of Bone and Cartilage Metabolism, University of Liege, Belgium."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "Y", "last_name": "Vrindts", "initials": "Y", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Lopez", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "D", "last_name": "De Groote", "initials": "D", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "P F", "last_name": "Zangerle", "initials": "PF", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J", "last_name": "Collette", "initials": "J", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "N", "last_name": "Franchimont", "initials": "N", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "V", "last_name": "Geenen", "initials": "V", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A", "last_name": "Albert", "initials": "A", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J Y", "last_name": "Reginster", "initials": "JY", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Maturitas", "issn": ["0378-5122"], "volume": "26", "issue": "1", "pub_year": "1997", "pub_month": "Jan", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "9034190", "doi": "10.1038/385729a0", "title": "A metalloproteinase disintegrin that releases tumour-necrosis factor-alpha from cells.", "abstract": "Mammalian cells proteolytically release (shed) the extracellular domains of many cell-surface proteins.

This study evaluated the relationship between inflammatory mediators, COX expression, and pathological changes in experimental alcoholic liver disease. METHODS: Rats (5 per group) were fed ethanol and a diet containing saturated fat, corn oil, or fish oil by intragastric infusion. Dextrose isocalorically replaced ethanol in controls. In the first set of experiments, whole livers were analyzed. In the second set of experiments, Kupffer cells, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes were isolated from rats in each group. Pathological analyses and measurements of lipid peroxidation, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, COX-1 and COX-2 messenger RNA (mRNA), endotoxin, and liver and plasma thromboxane were performed. RESULTS: Increased expression of COX-2 mRNA was detected in the livers of rats showing necroinflammatory changes. The Kupffer cell was the cell primarily responsible for the increase in COX-2 mRNA level. Increased expression of COX-2 was associated with increased levels of endotoxin, TNF-alpha mRNA, lipid peroxidation, and synthesis of thromboxane. COX-1 mRNA was decreased in Kupffer cells in rats with the most severe liver injury. CONCLUSIONS: Up-regulation of COX-2 in alcoholic liver injury occurred in the presence of proinflammatory stimuli and resulted in increased synthesis of inflammatory and vasoactive eicosanoids. Down-regulation of COX-1 may result in decreased synthesis of cytoprotective eicosanoids and additionally exacerbate liver injury.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "A A", "last_name": "Nanji", "initials": "AA", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "L", "last_name": "Miao", "initials": "L", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "P", "last_name": "Thomas", "initials": "P", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A", "last_name": "Rahemtulla", "initials": "A", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S", "last_name": "Khwaja", "initials": "S", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S", "last_name": "Zhao", "initials": "S", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "D", "last_name": "Peters", "initials": "D", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S R", "last_name": "Tahan", "initials": "SR", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A J", "last_name": "Dannenberg", "initials": "AJ", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Gastroenterology", "issn": ["0016-5085"], "volume": "112", "issue": "3", "pub_year": "1997", "pub_month": "Mar", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "9042193", "doi": null, "title": "IL-6 signals inhibition of cell adhesion in melanoma A375-C6.", "abstract": "IL-6 has been found to be a potent inhibitor of melanoma A375-C6 cell adhesion, in addition to its known action in arresting cells at G1/G0 phase of the cell cycle IL-6 treated melanoma cells were found to round up and to lose the ability to adhere to fibronectin, laminin, collagen, and tenascin over 72 to 96 hours of IL-6 treatment, a time course similar to that seen for cell cycle inhibition.

Functionally, the glycoprotein can adhere to and stimulate the thymidine incorporation of human mononuclear cells (MNC) in modest degree via its membranotropic property. In addition to MNC, the protein can also bind to the surface of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), red blood cells (RBC) and rat glomerular mesangial cells (RMC). Western blot analysis of various cell lysates with/without proteinase K pretreatment before cell lysis revealed that a 60 kDa and a molecule larger that 94 kDa on the surface of PMN, a 60 kDa protein on MNC and a 32 kDa protein on RBC are the binding molecules for THG. In contrast, many proteins on the surface of RMC could be bound by THG. Immunoprecipitation of membranous iodinated MNC lysates also confirmed that the 60 kDa molecule on MNC is the binding protein for THG. A number of monosaccharide including N-acetylneuraminic acid, N-acetyl-galactosamine, N-acetyl-glucosamine and alpha-methyl-D-mannoside could not inhibit the mitogenic effect of THG on human mononuclear cells.

PAE during the last 5 days of gestation blunted the PRL-induced increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation and TNF alpha levels in cells grown in the absence of ethanol in the culture medium. Addition of ethanol to primary PAE astrocyte cultures resulted in a modest increase in basal [3H]thymidine incorporation, but completely blocked the PRL-induced increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation and TNF alpha levels.

Thus, CDK inhibitors, in particular p18, are likely to play a pivotal role in controlling cell cycle arrest and cell death in terminal differentiation of late-stage B cells to plasma cells via inhibition of pRb phosphorylation by CDK6.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "L", "last_name": "Morse", "initials": "L", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Pathology, Cornell University Medical College, New York, New York 10021, USA."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "D", "last_name": "Chen", "initials": "D", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "D", "last_name": "Franklin", "initials": "D", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "Y", "last_name": "Xiong", "initials": "Y", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S", "last_name": "Chen-Kiang", "initials": "S", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Immunity", "issn": ["1074-7613"], "volume": "6", "issue": "1", "pub_year": "1997", "pub_month": "Jan", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "9052860", "doi": "10.1016/s0165-2478(96)02655-7", "title": "Integration of activatory and inhibitory signals in human B-cells.", "abstract": "Fc gamma receptors type IIb1 (Fc gammaRIIb1) inhibit B-cell activation when co-ligated with B-cell antigen receptors (BCR) by immune complexes. In murine B-cells the inhibition is mediated by the interaction of the phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (P-ITIM) of Fc gammaRIIb1 with the SH2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase. SHP1. To clarify the mechanism of Fc gammaRIIb mediated inhibition of human B-cells we have studied the association of signaling molecules with human Fc gammaRIIb1 after co-ligating with BCR. Fc gammaRIIb1 were affinity purified from the Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BL41. Several tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were co-isolated with Fc gammaRIIb1 at 145, 110, and 50 60 kDa, which were not present in Fc gammaRIIb1 free immune complexes. Among these molecules we have identified the p52 Shc adaptor protein. Furthermore, we have shown that the insolubilised synthetic peptide corresponding P-ITIM bound Shc, Lyn and the p75 and p 10 unidentified tyrosine phosphorylated proteins. Here we describe that the cell membrane associated Shc is partially dephosphorylated in BCR-Fc gammaRIIb1 co-ligated samples, suggesting that its function in regulating p21ras monomeric G protein is impaired. Indeed, we have detected a lower p21ras activity in BCR-Fc gammaRIIb1 co-crosslinked samples. These data indicate that co-ligation of BCR and Fc gammaRIIb1 interrupts signal transduction between protein tyrosine kinase activation and p21ras mediated activation pathway. Since in contrast to the mouse B-cells both Fc gammaRIIb1 and Fc gammaRIIb2 are expressed in human B-cells, we have investigated the inhibitory function of the two receptors in Fc gammaRIIb negative Burkitt lymphoma cell line ST486 transfected with Fc gammaRIIb1 and Fc gammaRIIb2, respectively. Both Fc gammaRIIb1 and Fc gammaRIIb2 inhibited the rise of intracellular Ca2+ induced by the crosslinking of BCR. The rate of the inhibition depended on the ratio of the co-crosslinked receptors (BCR-Fc gammaRIIb1) to the crosslinked BCR (BCR-BCR). Co-crosslinking of the two receptors inhibited not only the capacitive Ca2+ entry but rather the total Ca2+ response in both Fc gammaRIIb1 and Fc gammaRIIb2 transfected human B-cells. CD19 represents the signal transduction unit of complement receptor, CR2 (CD21), and is responsible for the complement activating IgM-immune complex induced enhancement of B-cell activation. Co-crosslinking of CD19 and BCR was shown to enhance B-cell activation due to the recruitment of further signaling molecules to the activator complex by the phosphorylated tyrosine residues of CD19. Here we show a novel finding that co-ligation of CD19 with Fc gammaRIIb1 inhibits the CD19-induced upregulation of Ca2+ response. The results indicate that IgG plus complement containing immune complexes may inhibit B-cell activation in vivo, due to the Fc gammaRIIb1-mediated interruption of signal transduction via both BCR and CD19.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "G", "last_name": "S\u00e1rmay", "initials": "G", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Lorand Eotvos University, Department of Immunology, God, Hungary."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "G", "last_name": "Koncz", "initials": "G", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J", "last_name": "Gergely", "initials": "J", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Immunology letters", "issn": ["0165-2478"], "volume": "54", "issue": "2-3", "pub_year": "1996", "pub_month": "Dec", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "9053449", "doi": "10.1084/jem.185.3.491", "title": "Involvement of Egr-1/RelA synergy in distinguishing T cell activation from tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced NF-kappa B1 transcription.", "abstract": "NF-kappa B is an important transcription factor required for T cell proliferation and other immunological functions.

Furthermore, EGF has been shown to increase IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 mRNA and protein levels in human TEC. Since EGF has been shown to modulate TGF-beta effector functions, we determined whether TGF-beta can modulate EGF-mediated increases in cytokine gene expression in human TEC. We established that a single TEC expresses both EGF receptor and TGF-beta R. TGF-beta plus EGF synergistically increased leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF), additively increased IL-6, but had little effect on IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA levels. In contrast, TGF-beta alone increased LIF and IL-6, had little effect on IL-1 alpha, and slightly decreased IL-1 beta mRNA levels. The increases in LIF and IL-6 mRNA levels by TGF-beta plus EGF correlate with the increases in LIF and IL-6 concentrations in TEC culture supernatants as detected by ELISA. We also determined the mechanism responsible for the increases in cytokine mRNA levels. TGF-beta plus EGF did not affect transcription of LIF and IL-6 genes; this suggests that the increases in the steady state levels of cytokine mRNA were mediated post-transcriptionally, most likely at the level of mRNA stability.

E3-10.4K/14.5K and E3-14.7K also inhibit TNF-induced release of arachidonic acid (AA). TNF-induced apoptosis and AA release are thought to require TNF-activation of the 85-kDa cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). cPLA2 normally exists in a latent form in the cytosol; it is activated by phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinase, and in the presence of agents that mobilize intracellular Ca2+, cPLA2 translocates to membranes where it cleaves AA from membrane phospholipids. We now report that TNF induces translocation of cPLA2 from the cytosol to membranes in Ad-infected human A549 cells and that E3-10.4K/14.5K but not E3-14.7K or E1B-19K is required to inhibit TNF-induced translocation of cPLA2.

In the present study we addressed the question whether interleukin-10 in combination with other TNF-suppressing agents leads to enhanced suppression of TNF synthesis. We investigated the inhibitory potency of interleukin-10 in combination with rolipram, a specific type IV phosphodiesterase inhibitor, or with cicaprost, a stable prostacyclin analogue in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

The early phase of Rel A.NF-kappaB1 translocation depends on simultaneous proteolysis of both IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta isoforms; IkappaBgamma is inert to TNFalpha treatment. The 60-min nadir is due to a rapid IkappaBalpha resynthesis that reassociates with Rel A and completely inhibits its DNA binding activity; the 60-min nadir is not observed when IkappaBalpha resynthesis is prevented by cycloheximide treatment.

Thus, TGF beta and TNF exerted a regulation of hOB cell PG biosynthesis that was principally directed towards an increased PGE2 biosynthesis, with lesser effects on the production of other PG metabolites. COX-2 mRNA levels were increased within 2 h of cytokine stimulation, reached a maximum at 6-12 h, and levels had appreciably diminished by 24 h after treatment. Both TGF beta and TNF could independently increase COX-2 mRNA levels and PG biosynthesis. However, the increased production of PGE2 resulting from TNF stimulation was blocked by the addition of an interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) neutralizing antibody, suggesting that TNF regulation of hOB cell PG synthesis was secondary to its capacity to increase hOB cell IL-1 beta production. TGF beta regulation of PG production was not affected by the addition of the neutralizing antibody. These studies support the proposition that PGs can be important autocrine/paracrine mediators of bone biology, whose production by hOB cells is responsively regulated by osteotropic cytokines.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "J", "last_name": "Xu", "initials": "J", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Biology, West Virginia University, Morgantown 26506-6057, USA."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "D S", "last_name": "Cissel", "initials": "DS", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S", "last_name": "Varghese", "initials": "S", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "D L", "last_name": "Whipkey", "initials": "DL", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J D", "last_name": "Blaha", "initials": "JD", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "G M", "last_name": "Graeber", "initials": "GM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "P E", "last_name": "Keeting", "initials": "PE", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Journal of cellular biochemistry", "issn": ["0730-2312"], "volume": "64", "issue": "4", "pub_year": "1997", "pub_month": "Mar", "pub_day": "15"}}, {"pmid": "9094433", "doi": "10.1016/s0014-5793(97)00167-1", "title": "Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) signals via the STAT3/APRF transcription factor in human hepatoma cells and hepatocytes.", "abstract": "Acute phase protein expression is regulated by a variety of cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-11, tumour necrosis factor alpha, interferon-gamma, oncostatin-M, leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor and cardiotrophin-1.

This study was designed to investigate the action of TNF-alpha on intestinal cell proliferation. METHODS: Young adult mouse colon cells were studied under nontransformed conditions with epidermal growth factor, keratinocyte growth factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, or serum in the presence or absence of TNF-alpha and cell numbers determined. The expression and independent actions of the 55-kilodalton TNF-alpha R1 and 75-kilodalton TNF-alpha R2 receptors were studied by immunologic methods. RESULTS: TNF-alpha stimulated proliferation at 0.1 and 1 ng/mL and inhibited proliferation at 100 and 1000 ng/mL without altering cell viability. TNF-alpha inhibited the mitogenic effect of growth factors and epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. TNF-alpha R1 receptor agonist antibody inhibited proliferation, whereas a TNF-alpha R2 receptor-blocking antibody prevented the proliferative effect of low-dose TNF-alpha. CONCLUSIONS: TNF-alpha displays a novel influence on intestinal cell growth, stimulating proliferation at physiological concentrations and inhibiting proliferation at pathological concentrations. The regulation of intestinal cell mitogenesis by TNF-alpha seems to be mediated differentially by the two TNF-alpha receptors, with the TNF-alpha R1 receptor inhibiting proliferation and the TNF-alpha R2 receptor promoting proliferation.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "G C", "last_name": "Kaiser", "initials": "GC", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-2576, USA."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "D B", "last_name": "Polk", "initials": "DB", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Gastroenterology", "issn": ["0016-5085"], "volume": "112", "issue": "4", "pub_year": "1997", "pub_month": "Apr", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "9099940", "doi": "10.1046/j.1365-2249.1996.57761.x", "title": "Function of C3 in a humoral response: iC3b/C3dg bound to an immune complex generated with natural antibody and a primary antigen promotes antigen uptake and the expression of co-stimulatory molecules by all B cells, but only stimulates immunoglobulin synthesis by antigen-specific B cells.", "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that an optimal humoral response to a primary protein antigen requires C3 and CR2 (CD21). Sera from non-immunized donors contain natural IgM and IgG antibodies to the primary antigen keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH), and these have been previously shown to form immune complexes (IC) that activate the classical pathway of C, fixing iC3b/C3dg onto the KLH antigen. Such KLH IC bind to CR2 on KLH-non-specific B lymphocytes, resulting in antigen processing and MHC class II-dependent presentation to KLH-specific helper T cells. KLH IC also induce B lymphocytes to express the CD80 costimulatory molecule via simultaneous CR2 ligation with C3 and Fc gammaRII (CD32) stimulation by IgG natural antibody. The current study demonstrated that KLH IC ligation to either CR2 or Fc gammaRII resulted in activation of a second co-stimulatory molecule, LFA-1 (CD11a, CD18). The possibility of polyclonal B cell stimulation by the presentation of KLH-iC3b/C3dg by antigen-non-specific B cells was excluded by demonstration that in vitro cultivation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with KLH-iC3b/C3dg elicited only anti-KLH, and did not stimulate synthesis of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV) or tetanus toxoid (TT). Of greatest significance, a specific anti-KLH response was only detectable in cultures stimulated with KLH-iC3b/C3dg and not in cultures stimulated with KLH alone or KLH-IgG.

This novel activation antigen is primarily expressed by hematopoietic cells including B lymphocytes, follicular dendritic cells, and monocytes. Recently, human fibroblasts from a variety of tissues were shown to display CD40; however, its function was unknown. Cellular responses mediated by CD40 are naturally triggered by its counter-receptor, the CD40 ligand, which is displayed on activated T cells, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and B lineage cells. This study investigated the functional significance of CD40 expression on periodontal fibroblasts, in the context of periodontal inflammation. The experiments reported herein demonstrate constitutive CD40 expression on cultured periodontal ligament (PDL) and gingival fibroblasts. Interestingly, cells of gingival origin displayed up to 13-fold higher constitutive levels of CD40, versus fibroblasts from PDL. Interferon gamma (IFN gamma) treatment enhanced CD40 expression on PDL and gingival fibroblasts, with up to 61-fold induction of expression. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect CD40 on fibroblastic cells in both normal and acutely inflamed gingival tissue. Expression of CD40 in inflamed tissue was significantly higher than in uninflamed tissue. Western blot analysis of anti-CD40 triggered cells revealed the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation on a 50 kDa protein in PDL and gingival fibroblasts. These results indicate that CD40 is an active signaling conduit in periodontal fibroblasts. This concept was further substantiated by the fact that CD40 engagement stimulated interleukin 6 (IL-6) production by gingival fibroblasts, but not periodontal ligament fibroblasts. Overall, these results demonstrate that CD40 on periodontal fibroblasts may functionally interact with CD40L-expressing cells. This CD40/CD40L interaction can stimulate fibroblast activation and synthesis of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "G D", "last_name": "Sempowski", "initials": "GD", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Rochester Cancer Center, NY, USA."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "P R", "last_name": "Chess", "initials": "PR", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A J", "last_name": "Moretti", "initials": "AJ", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J", "last_name": "Padilla", "initials": "J", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "R P", "last_name": "Phipps", "initials": "RP", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "T M", "last_name": "Blieden", "initials": "TM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Journal of periodontology", "issn": ["0022-3492"], "volume": "68", "issue": "3", "pub_year": "1997", "pub_month": "Mar", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "9102222", "doi": null, "title": "The anti-human tumor effect and generation of human cytotoxic T cells in SCID mice given human peripheral blood lymphocytes by the in vivo transfer of the Interleukin-6 gene using adenovirus vector.", "abstract": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was found to function as a late-acting killer helper factor in the differentiation of CTLs.

When these SCID-PBL/hu mice bearing allogeneic human CESS B blastoid tumor cells were treated in vivo with recombinant adenovirus vector expressing IL-6 cDNA, both the induction of CD8+ human CTLs against CESS cells in the spleen cells and peritoneal exudate cells and a prolongation in the survival of these mice were observed.

Activation of these two protein kinases by the cytokines may stimulate fibroblast proliferation in damaged nerves and thereby play a role in the formation of a neuroma, a disorganized mass of tissue that interferes with neural regeneration and repair. To investigate the possibility that this mechanism is operative in neuroma formation, we used cultured, serum-starved fibroblasts from surgically removed human neuromas stimulated with TNF-alpha and/or IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, and measured the activation of MAPK and SAPK using myelin basic protein (MBP) and human c-Jun (1-169) glutathione S-agarose transferase (GST) fusion protein as substrates. For comparison, neuroma fibroblast cultures were also stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and platelet-derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB), a potent activator for MAPK. TNF-alpha and both forms of IL-1 produced a rapid activation of MAPK, with a peak at 15 min for TNF-alpha stimulation, and a peak at 30 min for IL-1 stimulation. TNF-alpha combined with either IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta produced a synergistic effect on the activation of MAPK. The increases in MAPK induced by TNF-alpha and IL-1 were similar to the increases induced by PMA and PDGF-AB. To confirm the presence of MAPK, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were carried out on experimental and control lysates. TNF-alpha and IL-1 also increased activation of SAPK, but to a lesser extent than MAPK. PMA and PDGF-AB were also much less effective in stimulating activation of SAPK. Our findings indicate that TNF-alpha and IL-1 activate parallel signal transduction pathways in human neuroma fibroblasts, and that they are relatively stronger activators of MAPK than of SAPK.

However, it is determined in this study that murine L929 fibrosarcoma cells, when pretreated with bovine testicular hyaluronidase for 12-24 h, became resistant to the cytotoxic effect of TNF-alpha in the presence of DNA intercalators, such as ActD, doxorubicin, and daunorubicin.

A semisynthetic polysulfated hyaluronic acid (HA) inhibited the increased TNF/ActD resistance, whereas unmodified HA, dextran sulfate, and naturally polysulfated glycosaminoglycans had no effect. Evidence is provided here that the induced resistance is related to serum fetuin and a novel intracellular 35-kDa TNF-binding protein (intra TBP). Under serum-free conditions, L929 became refractory to TNF/ActD cytotoxicity and hyaluronidase reversed the resistance. Exogenous fetuin increased L929 cell spreading and proliferation, and restored hyaluronidase-induction of TNF/ActD resistance in these serum-starved cells. Hyaluronidase failed to reduce the expression of TNF-receptors and their binding of TNF-alpha. However, binding and Western-blotting analyses revealed that hyaluronidase downregulated the intra-TBP.

This infection can be reactivated following exposure to tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. We examined the possibility that Nef alters the TNF-alpha-induced cell signalling in astroglioma cells through the sphingomyelin pathway. METHODS: Sphingomyelinase activation by TNF-alpha was analysed in U251MG glial cells constitutively expressing Nef and compared with U251MG cells stably transfected with the expression vector alone. The consequent effect on the cellular proliferative response and induction of nuclear factor NF-kappa B and AP-1 binding activities were examined. RESULTS: A marked enhancement in the levels of ceramide, a product of the sphingomyelin hydrolysis, was observed in U251MG-Nef upon stimulation with TNF-alpha. In contrast, ceramide levels in control cells were barely increased under similar conditions. A concomitant reduction of sphingomyelin level occurred in U251MG-Nef cells. In addition, the reduced survival rate of U251MG cells resulting from TNF-alpha activation was prevented in the presence of Nef. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that nef expression inhibits AP-1 activation without altering the induction of NF-kappa B. CONCLUSION: These results strongly suggest that nef expression in U251MG cells modulates the sphingomyelinase signalling pathway triggered by TNF-alpha, thus leading to important modifications in the activation and proliferation of glial cells.

RESULTS: Interleukin 6 level was elevated in 11 (79%), interleukin 8 in 10 (71%), and tumor necrosis factor in 2 (14%) of the 14 patients.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels did not vary significantly; they were associated with infection in 2 left ventricular assist device recipients and normalized after left ventricular assist device support.

PMA-induced IL-6 mRNA levels in RASMC were markedly attenuated after downregulation of PKC with PMA and by the selective PKC inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide. In contrast, IL-1-induced increases in IL-6 mRNA were not affected by either PKC downregulation or bisindolylmaleimide.

LPS- and IL-1 beta-stimulated adrenal TNF release was inhibited by adenosine. Adenosine increased IL-6 release and inhibited TNF release from ovarian cells. Anterior pituitary cells released IL-6, but no detectable TNF. Adenosine, via A2 receptors, stimulated IL-6 secretion from these cells. Peritoneal macrophage IL-6 release was increased and TNF release decreased by adenosine.

Both cytokines have potent biological effects on glial cells and are strongly implicated in the pathology of central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating diseases. However, to date, neither constitutive nor cytokine-induced TNFR expression by glial cells have been definitively characterized. We therefore characterized TNF receptors at the molecular, protein, and functional levels in rat astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. Northern blotting demonstrated that all three types of glia constitutively transcribed a single TNFR1 mRNA. IFN gamma increased transcript levels in all three types of glia, but TNF alpha increased levels only in oligodendrocytes Microglia constitutively transcribed three distinct TNFR2 mRNAs, levels of which were increased by either IFN gamma or TNF alpha. In contrast, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes constitutively transcribed nearly undetectable levels of TNFR2 mRNAs, and levels were not affected by IFN gamma, TNF alpha, or oligodendrocyte maturation. Immunocytochemical staining of glial cells corroborated Northern data by demonstrating that glia express a parallel pattern of TNFR proteins on their cell surfaces. In co-cultures of microglia plated atop irradiated astrocytes, human TNF alpha (which, on mouse cells, binds TNFR1 exclusively) induced microglial cell proliferation, whereas murine TNF alpha (which binds both TNFRs) did not. Collectively, the data show that microglia, a primary source of TNF alpha at CNS inflammatory sites, express both TNFR1 and TNFR2, whereas astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, whose embryological origin differs from that of microglia, predominantly express TNFR1. TNF alpha increases expression of TNFR1 by oligodendrocytes whereas it increases expression of TNFR2 by microglia. Microglia proliferation data suggest that signals transduced through TNFR2 directly or indirectly inhibit signals transduced through TNFR1.

Absence of pRB may then induce an autocrine IL-6 expression in myeloma cells and contribute to the autonomous growth of MM.

IL-6-stimulated macrophage differentiation of murine myeloid M1 cells is accompanied by iNOS gene induction and steady-state mRNA expression. Two regions within the iNOS promoter mediate transcriptional responsiveness to LPS and IFN-gamma. Region I contains several essential transcription factor binding motifs and promotes responsiveness to LPS, whereas region II potentiates the LPS response by IFN-gamma. Because region I possesses basal promoter activity and directly mediates iNOS gene activation, we attempted to identify the trans-acting factors involved in IL-6-stimulated induction of the murine iNOS gene through this region. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and methylation interference, we show that IL-6 induced reciprocal changes in the binding activity of POU family members to the candidate nonconsensus octamer sequence of region I that correlated, temporally, with iNOS steady-state mRNA expression. Although DNA-protein binding activity of IL-6-stimulated whole-cell extracts also interacted with a radiolabeled canonical octamer motif, such DNA-protein complexes were not eliminated in competition assays using consensus nuclear factor kappaB or IL-6 oligonucleotides. Specifically, our studies show that octamer binding protein-1-related protein binding activity decreased, while binding of octamer binding protein-2-related proteins increased during differentiation. Mutation of the octamer motif disrupted both binding of the IL-6-induced protein-DNA interactions and transcriptional activation through region I, revealing that this motif is absolutely essential for IL-6 induction of iNOS.

Enhancement of constitutive IL-6 release required higher concentrations of inhibitors, while enhanced CSF-1-induced release was diminished when inhibitor concentrations exceeded defined limits. SP was also shown to activate constitutive IL-6 release by blood monocytes and elicited PM phi but had no effect on their responsiveness to CSF-1. Activation of PKC by exposure of resident PM phi to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) also resulted in enhanced IL-6 release and PMA was shown to synergize with CSF-1. These data indicate that CSF-1 does not induce Il6 gene expression by amplifying the constitutive pathway in all mononuclear phagocyte subpopulations. It exerts its effects independently of PKC, which may activate Il6 gene expression in its own right by an alternative pathway. While CSF-1 and PKC are involved in separate pathways, the synergistic IL-6 response seen when PMA and CSF-1 interact suggests convergence of the two pathways.

Various systemic and local factors can stimulate IL-6/IL-11 production, but the intracellular mechanism for such stimulation is largely unknown. In this study, we characterized the second messenger signaling in parathyroid hormone (PTH)- and IL-1-induced production of IL-6/IL-11 and studied the possible modulating effects of estrogen. rhPTH(1-34) and rhIL-1 alpha dose-dependently stimulated IL-6 and IL-11 production from human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs). Agonists for protein kinase A (PKA) (forskolin), and protein kinase C (PKC) (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PMA) also stimulated IL-6/IL-11 production. Rp-diastereoisomer of adenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphorothioate (Rp-cAMPS) and H-8, inhibitors of PKA, significantly inhibited PTH-stimulated IL-6/IL-11 production, but did not inhibit IL-1-stimulated IL-6/IL-11 production. In contrast, staurosporine and calphostin C, inhibitors of PKC, suppressed IL-1-stimulated, but not PTH-stimulated, IL-6/ IL-11 production. Pretreatment of cells with 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta-E2) antagonized IL-1-stimulated IL-6 production. However, PTH-stimulated IL-6 production and IL-1- and PTH-stimulated IL-11 production were not affected by 17 beta-E2. Similarly, 17 beta-E2 inhibited PMA-stimulated IL-6 production, whereas neither forskolin-stimulated IL-6/ IL-11 production nor PMA-stimulated IL-11 production was affected by 17 beta-E2. These results indicate that different second messengers are involved in PTH- and IL-1-induced IL-6 and IL-11 production by hBMSCs: PTH and IL-1 stimulate IL-6/IL-11 production via a PKA-dependent and PKC-dependent pathway, respectively. Furthermore, our results suggest that regulation of cytokine production by estrogen in hBMSCs is selective; only the IL-1-induced IL-6 production, which is mediated by PKC pathway, is inhibited, but PTH-induced IL-6 production and PTH/IL-1-induced IL-11 production are not inhibited by estrogen.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "G S", "last_name": "Kim", "initials": "GS", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Division of Endocrinology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "C H", "last_name": "Kim", "initials": "CH", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "C S", "last_name": "Choi", "initials": "CS", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J Y", "last_name": "Park", "initials": "JY", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "K U", "last_name": "Lee", "initials": "KU", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "issn": ["0884-0431"], "volume": "12", "issue": "6", "pub_year": "1997", "pub_month": "Jun", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "9169458", "doi": "10.1074/jbc.272.23.14883", "title": "HIV-1 Tat induces the expression of the interleukin-6 (IL6) gene by binding to the IL6 leader RNA and by interacting with CAAT enhancer-binding protein beta (NF-IL6) transcription factors.", "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is associated with severe psoriasis, B cell lymphoma, and Kaposi's sarcoma.

Here we report the molecular mechanisms of Tat activity on the expression of the IL6 gene. By using 5' deletion mutants of pIL6Pr-CAT and using IL6:HIV-1-LTR hybrid constructs where discrete regions of the IL6 promoter replaced the TAR sequence in HIV-1 LTR, we identified a short sequence of the 5'-untranslated region of the IL6 mRNA that is required for Tat to trans-activate the IL6 promoter. This sequence acquires a stem-loop structure and includes a UCU sequence that binds to Tat and is necessary for full trans-activation. In addition, we provide the evidence that Tat can function by enhancing the CAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) DNA binding activity and is able to complex with in vitro translated C/EBPbeta, which is a major mediator of IL6 promoter function. By using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation, we observed that the interaction of Tat with C/EBP proteins also occurred in vivo. The data are consistent with the possibility that Tat may function on heterologous genes by interacting with RNA structures possibly present in a large number of cellular and viral genes.

To quantitate the relative contribution of the spleen to endotoxin-induced IL-6 production, we studied the effect of endotoxin (1.0 microg/kg of body weight) in control dogs (n = 7) and splenectomized dogs (n = 7). Blood for analysis of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-6 was sampled from the femoral artery and the portal, hepatic, and splenic (only in controls) veins. Arterial plasma endotoxin and cortisol levels were also measured. Whole-body IL-6 production was calculated by a deconvolution technique. Splenic IL-6 production in control dogs was measured from splenic blood flow and arteriovenous concentration differences. Endotoxin levels were higher in splenectomized dogs (P < 0.05) because of a decreased distribution volume (P < 0.05) and decreased clearance of endotoxin (P < 0.05). Endotoxin-induced plasma IL-6 levels were decreased by approximately 75% in splenectomized dogs (P < 0.01), and whole-body IL-6 production rates were severalfold lower (median of 8.7 mg/4 h and range of 3.9 to 11.4 mg/4 h versus a median of 32.3 mg/4 h and a range of 22.7 to 70.2 mg/4 h) (P < 0.05).

In conclusion, splenectomy decreases the distribution volume and clearance rate of endotoxin. Splenectomy results in decreased endotoxin-induced IL-6 production, which is caused not by the absence of splenic IL-6 production, but by a decrease in nonsplenic IL-6 production.

In vitro. Ag-Ab complexes are poorly immunogenic but in vivo immune complexes elicit potent recall responses. FDC trap Ag-Ab complexes and make immune complex coated bodies or \"iccosomes\". B cells endocytose iccosomes, the Ag is processed, and T-cell help is elicited. In vitro, addition of FDC bearing appropriate Ag-Ab complex to memory T and B cells provoke potent recall responses (IgG and IgE). FDC also provide nonspecific costimulatory signals which augment B-cell proliferation and Ab production. B cell-FDC contact is important and interference with ICAM-1-LFA-1 interactions reduces FDC-mediated costimulation. Preliminary data suggest that a costimulatory signal may be delivered via CR2L on FDC binding CR2 on B cells. FDC can also stimulate B cells to become chemotactically active and can protect lymphocytes from apoptosis. FDC also appear to be rich in thiol groups and may replace reducing compounds such as 2 mercaptoethanol in cultures. In short, FDC-Ag specifically signals B cells through BCR, and FDC provide B cells with iccosomal-Ag necessary for processing to elicit T-cell help. In addition, FDC provide nonspecific signals that are important to promote B-cell proliferation, maintain viability, and induce chemotactic responsiveness.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "J G", "last_name": "Tew", "initials": "JG", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond 23298-0678, USA.

They are produced in the thyroid by intrathyroidal inflammatory cells, in particular lymphocytes, as well as by the thyroid follicular cells (TFC) themselves and may thus act in a cascade to enhance the autoimmune process (Fig. 1). Cytokines upregulate the inflammatory reaction through stimulation of both T and B cells, resulting in antibody production and tissue injury. In addition, intrathyroidal cytokines induce immunological changes in TFC including enhancement of both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecule expression, and upregulation of adhesion and complement regulatory molecule expression. Cytokines can also modulate both growth and function of TFC and have a role in extrathyroidal complications of ATD, most importantly thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO), where they induce fibroblast proliferation and enhance the production of glycosaminoglycans (GAG), resulting in proptosis and the other clinical features of the disease. In addition to these effects, exogenous administration of cytokines has been associated with impairment of thyroid function ranging from the appearance of autoantibodies alone to the development of frank thyroid dysfunction. Cytokines have also been implicated in subacute thyroiditis (SAT) and amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction, as well as in thyroid function abnormalities occurring in patients with non-thyroidal illnesses (NTI). Genetic variations in cytokine genes represent potential risk factors for ATD, and disease associations have been described for polymorphisms in IL-1ra and TNF beta genes.

Transient increases of D-dimer, fibrinopeptide A, thrombin-antithrombin and the activated partial thromboplastin time were observed. Each parameter had a particular (time and Xa/phospholipid dose dependent) pattern of changes. The principal effect of IL-6 was a more rapid restoration of fibrinogen concentrations and of overall coagulation tests. Injection of factor Xa/phospholipids led also to a rapid increase of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) the extent of which was dependent on Xa/phospholipid dose. Pretreatment with IL-6 induced a threefold increase of basal t-PA and a corresponding increase of the t-PA response. Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) concentrations did not change after low dose Xa/phospholipids, but increased eightfold after high dose Xa/phospholipids, IL-6 pretreatment induced within 8 h a twentyfold increase of PAI-1 but no further increase was observed after injection of factor Xa/phospholipids. Thus, in vivo thrombin generation leads to dynamic modifications of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems.

When IL-6-deficient mice were injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) with lipopolysaccaride (LPS), no differences were observed in the production of TNF in the brain, while in the periphery (serum or spleen) TNF levels were markedly increased (about four-fold).

Co-administration of soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) did not enhance the effect of IL-6 on brain TNF, so this refractoriness cannot be attributed to a lack of IL-6 receptors. Interestingly, IL-6 potently inhibited LPS-induced TNF production by macrophagic cells but not by a microglial cell clone, suggesting that the defective response to IL-6 of the brain lies within the responsiveness TNF producing cells to IL-6.

In rat cortical type I astrocytes, interleukin 6 release is under the control of cAMP-protein kinase A and calcium-phospholipids-protein kinase C systems. Somatostatin is a neuropeptide, acting as a neurotransmitter, highly concentrated within the CNS, where it has been involved in the modulation of learning and memory processes. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of somatostatin on the release of interleukin 6 from rat cortical type I astrocytes and the intracellular mechanisms involved in this activity. Our results show that somatostatin, in a concentration-dependent manner, inhibited basal and forskolin-stimulated interleukin 6 release from rat cortical type I astrocytes in culture. The EC50 of the inhibitory action was calculated to be approximately 10 nM. Furthermore, this effect of somatostatin was completely abolished by pretreating cortical astrocytes with pertussis toxin that, uncoupling, by ADP-rybosylating, the inhibitory GTP-binding protein from the receptors, prevents the activation of the intracellular effectors such as the adenylyl cyclase enzyme. To identify the intracellular mechanism mediating the effects of somatostatin on the interleukin 6 release, we evaluated the peptide modulation of basal and stimulated intracellular accumulation of cAMP. In our experimental conditions somatostatin significantly inhibited both basal and forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Conversely, somatostatin did not affect the increase of interleukin 6 release induced by dibutyryl-cAMP, a nonhydrolizable cAMP analog that, bypassing the effects of somatostatin on adenylyl cyclase activity, directly activated protein kinase A. These observations support the hypothesis that somatostatin inhibitory activity on interleukin 6 release is mediated by its effects on cAMP production. Somatostatin analog SMS 201-995 did not affect interleukin 6 production either in basal or stimulated conditions. Since, SMS 201-995 was reported to bind with high affinity only to somatostatin receptors type 2, 3 and 5, the lack of effect of this compound on interleukin 6 release suggests that the inhibitory action of somatostatin could be mediated by the activation of either type 1 or type 4 somatostatin receptors. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the release of interleukin 6 from rat cortical type I astrocytes is inhibited by somatostatin through the activation of a somatostatin receptor coupled to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase via a G-protein sensitive to pertussis toxin.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Grimaldi", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Dipartimento di Neuroscienze e della Comunicazione Interumana, Universit\u00e0 di Napoli Federico II, Italy. maurizio@codon.nih.gov"], "emails": ["maurizio@codon.nih.gov"]}, {"fore_name": "T", "last_name": "Florio", "initials": "T", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "G", "last_name": "Schettini", "initials": "G", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "issn": ["0006-291X"], "volume": "235", "issue": "1", "pub_year": "1997", "pub_month": "Jun", "pub_day": "09"}}, {"pmid": "9197377", "doi": "10.1089/aid.1997.13.829", "title": "Effects of human immunodeficiency virus and colony-stimulating factors on the production of interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha by monocyte/macrophages.", "abstract": "Patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) frequently have increased production of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and these cytokines may in turn contribute to the disease pathogenesis. It has been hypothesized that secretion of these cytokines by HIV-exposed mononuclear cells or HIV-infected monocyte/macrophages (M/Ms) is the principal source of their overproduction in HIV-infected patients, and the present study was undertaken to explore this issue. We observed that in the absence of endotoxin or cytokines, M/Ms productively infected by HIV do not produce detectable IL-6 or TNF-alpha. However, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a cytokine that enhances HIV replication in M/Ms and is frequently used to propagate monocytotropic strains of HIV, can induce the relatively long-term production of IL-6 (up to 47 U/ml) and TNF-alpha (up to 47 pg/ml) by M/Ms, even in the absence of HIV. Also, HIV induced production of a relatively small (< or = 9 U/ml) quantity of IL-6 in M/Ms stimulated with macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF). Finally, while highly concentrated HIV induced production of both cytokines by either M/Ms or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), this production was almost completely eliminated when care was taken to avoid contamination of HIV by endotoxin.

Th2 cells appear not to be affected by melatonin, since IL-4, which is mostly produced by Th2 cells, is not modified by the hormone. Melatonin also enhances IL-6 production by PBMCs. The activation by melatonin of IL-6 production is apparently related to the presence of monocytes, rather than to Th2 cells, in the cell preparation, since PBMCs depleted of monocytes (CD14+ cells) were not activated. Activation of PBMCs by melatonin was dependent on the dose and, measured by cytokine production, was observed only when cells were either not activated or only slightly activated by low concentrations of PHA, or when cell activation was achieved by incubating the cells with previously irradiated cells. Using a different approach to identify what type of cells among the PBMC subsets was activated by melatonin, the expression of CD69, a marker of cell activation, was studied. Melatonin increased the percentage of cells expressing the CD69 Ag in CD4+ but not in CD8+ cells. We have also achieved enhanced production of IL-2 and IL-6 using CGP 52608, a specific ligand of the putative nuclear melatonin receptor RZR/ROR, raising the possibility of direct effects of melatonin on gene regulation in both Th1 cells and monocytes.

The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was assessed by ELISA and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Unlike normal fibroblasts, synovial fibroblasts from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis constitutively secreted significant levels of VEGF, which is known to act directly on endothelial cells. VEGF secretion was further inducible by both hypoxia and interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and these increases were additive. In contrast, tumor necrosis factor alpha was unable to induce VEGF expression. CONCLUSION: Under hypoxia or IL-1 stimulation, conditions common to the inflamed synovium, type B synoviocytes secrete increased levels of VEGF, which is likely to act on nearby endothelia, promoting angiogenesis.

In this report, we show that this inhibition, when induced by pervanadate, caused the tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the p60 receptor, as revealed by phosphoamino acid analysis. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis indicated that pervanadate specifically induced the phosphorylation of tyrosine-331, which is located in the death domain of the TNF receptor, a domain to which p60TRAK binds. This tyrosine residue was also phosphorylated by purified, recombinant pp60Src in vitro. Inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases by pervanadate also led to the inactivation of p60TRAK. In contrast, okadaic acid, a specific inhibitor of protein serine/threonine phosphatase, increased p60TRAK activity.

Pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 mg/kg, i.v.) suppressed the ACTH response induced by IL-6. The number of IL-6-induced immunoreactive cells in the PVN was significantly reduced by indomethacin pretreatment (p < 0.01), but the number of IL-6-induced c-fos-positive cells in the SON and CeA remained unchanged.

We performed dose-response studies of recombinant human IL-6 on pituitary hormone secretion in 15 healthy male volunteers, using 5 single, escalating subcutaneous doses of IL-6 (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 and 10.0 micrograms/kg body weight), each in 3 volunteers. We measured resting metabolic rate (RMR) with indirect calorimetry and plasma anterior pituitary hormones and vasopressin (AVP) at baseline and half-hourly over 4 h after the injection. All doses examined were tolerated well and produced no significant adverse effects. Dose-dependent RMR increases were observed in response to the 3.0- and 10.0-microgram/kg doses of IL-6, beginning at 60 min and slowly peaking between 180 and 240 min. Plasma adrenocorticotropic-hormone concentrations increased dramatically and dose-dependently in all the patients who received the 3.0- and 10.0-microgram/kg doses of IL-6, respectively, peaking to 150 and 255 pg/ml at 60 min, and slowly returning to normal by 4 h. Corresponding plasma cortisol levels peaked dose-dependently between 90 and 150 min, but remained elevated throughout the sampling period. In contrast, the growth hormone (GH) dose-response was bell-shaped, with maximum (approximately 100-fold) stimulation achieved by 3.0 micrograms/kg IL-6. Prolactin (PRL) showed a similar but less pronounced response pattern. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) dose-dependently and progressively decreased over the 240 min, while gonadotropins showed no clear-cut changes. In conclusion, subcutaneous IL-6 administration induced synchronized dose-dependent increases in the RMR and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, suggesting that hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone may mediate both of these functions in humans. IL-6 also acutely stimulated GH and PRL secretion and suppressed TSH secretion. The dose of 3.0 micrograms/kg could be used safely in the study of patients with disturbances of the hypothalamic-pituitary unit or of thermogenesis.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "C", "last_name": "Tsigos", "initials": "C", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Developmental Endocrinology Branch, NICHD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. 20892, USA."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "D A", "last_name": "Papanicolaou", "initials": "DA", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "R", "last_name": "Defensor", "initials": "R", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "C S", "last_name": "Mitsiadis", "initials": "CS", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "I", "last_name": "Kyrou", "initials": "I", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "G P", "last_name": "Chrousos", "initials": "GP", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Neuroendocrinology", "issn": ["0028-3835"], "volume": "66", "issue": "1", "pub_year": "1997", "pub_month": "Jul", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "9262229", "doi": "10.1203/00006450-199708000-00018", "title": "Cytokine production differs in children and adults.", "abstract": "The susceptibility of normal, healthy children to infection has long been recognized, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.

In this study, we therefore characterized IL-6 signaling cascades in MM cell lines, MM patient cells, and IL-6-dependent B9 cells to determine which pathway mediates IL-6-dependent growth.

IL-6 triggered phosphorylation of STAT1 and/or STAT3 in MM cells independent of their proliferative response to IL-6. In contrast, IL-6 induced phosphorylation of Shc and its association with Sos1, as well as phosphorylation of MAPK, only in MM cells and B9 cells that proliferated in response to IL-6. Moreover, MAPK antisense, but not sense, oligonucleotide inhibited IL-6-induced proliferation of these cells.

TNF also decreased glucose uptake in muscle, although the decrease was only statistically significant compared with IGF-I infusion. In addition, TNF significantly reduced plasma IGF-I concentration. However, during hyperinsulinemic and euglycemic conditions, exogenous IGF-I significantly increased glucose uptake in muscle and glycogen storage in the liver and abdominis muscle in both saline- and TNF-treated groups. IGF-I normalized each of the effects of TNF in the rats, including those on plasma IGF-I, glucose uptake in muscle, and glycogen content in liver and abdominis muscle. These data suggest that under hyperinsulinemic and euglycemic conditions, TNF-treated rats, although resistant to insulin, have a normal response to IGF-I, indicating that the TNF-induced defect in the insulin pathway may not be a step in the IGF-I pathway.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "P R", "last_name": "Ling", "initials": "PR", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Laboratory of Nutrition/Infection, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "P", "last_name": "Sierra", "initials": "P", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "Z", "last_name": "Qu", "initials": "Z", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "B R", "last_name": "Bistrian", "initials": "BR", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Metabolism: clinical and experimental", "issn": ["0026-0495"], "volume": "46", "issue": "9", "pub_year": "1997", "pub_month": "Sep", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "9285240", "doi": "10.1016/s0162-3109(96)00166-x", "title": "Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) augments cytokine induction by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulation and by bacterial infections in mice.", "abstract": "We studied the effects of M-CSF on cytokine induction in vivo by LPS or by bacterial infection by comparing between the serum cytokine levels of mice administered with and without M-CSF. M-CSF at 250 micrograms/kg/day for 3 days significantly augmented serum IL-6 level induced by a subsequent injection of 25 micrograms/kg of LPS. The augmented IL-6-induction was dose-dependent from 50 to 1250 micrograms/kg/day of M-CSF, and required 2- to 3-doses of M-CSF at 250 micrograms/kg/day. Mice primed with M-CSF induced IL-6 in response to a 5-fold lower dose of LPS, and also produced higher levels of IL-1 alpha, IL-10, GM-CSF, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma than control mice. The priming effect of M-CSF was transient and reversible, and elicited independently of T-cells. An injection with intact bacteria, such as Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus also induced IL-6 in normal mice, and M-CSF administration augmented the induction of these cytokines. These results showed that M-CSF positively regulates LPS-dependent and -independent cytokine induction, suggesting a defensive effect against infectious agents through enhanced cytokine production.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "T", "last_name": "Hanamura", "initials": "T", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Central Research Laboratory, Green Cross Corporation, Osaka, Japan."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "E", "last_name": "Asakura", "initials": "E", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "T", "last_name": "Tanabe", "initials": "T", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Immunopharmacology", "issn": ["0162-3109"], "volume": "37", "issue": "1", "pub_year": "1997", "pub_month": "Aug", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "9288697", "doi": "10.1016/s0378-5122(97)00034-0", "title": "A surprisingly ameliorating effect of high doses of estradiol in primary osteomyelofibrosis: a case report.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To report a case of a postmenopausal woman with primary (idiopathic) osteomyelofibrosis who showed a considerable improvement under the effect of high doses of estradiol given for the control of severe intractable menopausal symptoms. METHODS: This study was carried out by a case report. RESULTS: Astonishingly, under the effect of high doses of estradiol, both clinical and laboratory indices of the disease were not only kept stable but also showed a noticeable improvement. Hemoglobin increased from a value of 8.4 gm/dl in 1989 to 10.7 gm/dl in 1996. Blood transfusion was no longer necessary, the patient had had no infections whatsoever and was only afraid of not being allowed to continue using these high estrogen doses, which seemed indispensable and central to her well-being. CONCLUSIONS: High doses of estrogens could possibly be given the credit for ameliorating the natural sinister course of primary osteomyelofibrosis.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "A", "last_name": "Nasr", "initials": "A", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Freiburg, Germany. anasr@frk1.uk1.uni-freiburg.de"], "emails": ["anasr@frk1.uk1.uni-freiburg.de"]}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Breckwoldt", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Maturitas", "issn": ["0378-5122"], "volume": "27", "issue": "3", "pub_year": "1997", "pub_month": "Jul", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "9290159", "doi": "10.1016/0143-4004(77)90018-2", "title": "The North American trophoblast meeting, San Diego, California, USA, 19 March 1997.", "abstract": null, "author_list": [{"fore_name": "I", "last_name": "Doughty", "initials": "I", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Child Health, University of Manchester, St Mary's Hospital, UK."], "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Placenta", "issn": ["0143-4004"], "volume": "18", "issue": "7", "pub_year": "1997", "pub_month": "Sep", "pub_day": null}}]
