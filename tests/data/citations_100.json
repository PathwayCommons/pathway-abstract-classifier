Careful assay revealed only minimal concentrations of IL-1, particularly its biologically active form, in SF. No IL-1 was detectable in the plasma of patients that had IL-1 in their SF. Concentrations of both immunoreactive IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha in SF of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients were significantly higher than those in SF from patients with other inflammatory arthritides or osteoarthritis (OA). IL-6 and sIL-2R concentrations in both SF and plasma were higher in RA patients than in OA patients, and were significantly correlated. Approximately half of the SF from patients with all arthropathies contained detectable IFN-alpha, whilst IFN-Y was present in less than 10%. There were significant associations between IL-6, sIL-2R, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and IFN-alpha. The concentration of these cytokines, where detectable, was also related to leukocyte counts in the SF, as well as to parameters assessing local and systemic disease activity. Although IL-6 was the cytokine most clearly related to other cytokines, and to parameters assessing disease activity, the relationship between general articular disease activity and IL-6 was only evident in patients with arthropathies other than rheumatoid arthritis.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "I", "last_name": "Holt", "initials": "I", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["University of Manchester Rheumatic Diseases Centre, Hope Hospital, Salford."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "R G", "last_name": "Cooper", "initials": "RG", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J", "last_name": "Denton", "initials": "J", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A", "last_name": "Meager", "initials": "A", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "S J", "last_name": "Hopkins", "initials": "SJ", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "British journal of rheumatology", "issn": ["0263-7103"], "volume": "31", "issue": "11", "pub_year": "1992", "pub_month": "Nov", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "1309841", "doi": null, "title": "Proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-6, but not IL-1, down-regulate the osteocalcin gene promoter.", "abstract": "A proinflammatory cytokine cascade, including IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8, is activated in response to infection or immunologic insult. Besides their immunologic effects, several of these mediators stimulate bone resorption and inhibit bone formation. Osteocalcin, the most abundant noncollagenous protein present in bone, is an osteoblast-specific product whose production closely correlates with bone formation, and which has also been implicated in control of bone resorption. IL-1 and TNF have previously been shown to down-regulate osteocalcin production in vitro and in vivo, although the mechanism of this inhibition is unknown. In the present studies, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha both inhibited 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-stimulated production of osteocalcin protein and mRNA by ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells, whereas IL-6 had no effect on protein and only weakly inhibited mRNA. To determine if down-regulation was exerted at the transcriptional level, an osteocalcin promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion gene was constructed (PHOC-CAT). After transient transfection of PHOC-CAT into ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells, reporter CAT activity was up-regulated by vitamin D at concentrations above 10(-12) M. In screening studies, TNF-alpha (-57%) and IL-6 (-37%) inhibited vitamin D-stimulated osteocalcin transcription, whereas IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-8 had no effect. Other immune cytokines and growth factors, including IL-2, IL-3, IL-7, and M-CSF, also failed to regulate osteocalcin transcription. Despite their lack of promoter regulation, IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta also stimulated PGE2 production by ROS 17/2.8, further confirming the ability of the host cell to respond to these mediators. In dose-response experiments, down-regulation by TNF-alpha was significant at concentrations as low as 0.14 pM (0.1 U/ml), whereas approximately 10(4)-fold higher concentration of IL-6 was required to exert a similar effect. TNF-alpha-mediated down-regulation was unaffected by indomethacin. These data demonstrate that of these cytokines, TNF-alpha alone potently down-regulates osteocalcin promoter function, whereas IL-1 acts post-transcriptionally, possibly by reducing mRNA stability. Heterogeneity therefore exists among the proinflammatory cytokines with respect to the level at which control of osteocalcin expression is exerted.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "Y P", "last_name": "Li", "initials": "YP", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Immunology, Forsyth Research Institute, Boston, MA 02115."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "P", "last_name": "Stashenko", "initials": "P", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "issn": ["0022-1767"], "volume": "148", "issue": "3", "pub_year": "1992", "pub_month": "Feb", "pub_day": "01"}}, {"pmid": "1311232", "doi": "10.1210/endo.130.3.1311232", "title": "Adrenocorticotropin increases interleukin-6 release from rat adrenal zona glomerulosa cells.", "abstract": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is produced by adrenal zona glomerulosa cells; its release is stimulated by several secretagogues, including IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and angiotensin II. The present study reports that ACTH (0.1-100 nM) increased the release of IL-6 from primary cultures of rat adrenal cells in a concentration-dependent manner. This increase was accompanied by an increase in cAMP content in cell extracts and in the incubation medium. The dynamics of IL-6 release from the adrenal cells also were investigated using a perifusion system; approximately 50 min were required for the effects of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and ACTH on IL-6 release to become apparent. Following withdrawal of the secretagogues, IL-6 release returned to basal levels within 90-120 min. In some experiments, the adrenal zona glomerulosa was separated from the zona fasciculata/reticularis to determine the origin of secretagogue-stimulated IL-6 release. PGE2 and forskolin increased IL-6 release from both cell types, but maximal release from zona glomerulosa cells was more than 10-fold greater than that from zona fasciculata/reticularis cells. ACTH (0.1-100 nM) increased intracellular cAMP levels in cells from both cell types in a concentration-dependent manner, but increased IL-6 release only from zona glomerulosa cells. Dexamethasone, an inhibitor of IL-6 production in several tissues, had no effect on either basal or stimulated IL-6 production in the adrenal. Because IL-1 beta is produced primarily by tissues of the immune system, whereas ACTH is a classical endocrine hormone, we investigated the effect of interaction of these proteins on IL-6 release from the adrenal. Together, IL-1 beta and ACTH stimulation of IL-6 release was greater than the sum of the effects of each substance separately; however, IL-1 beta did not potentiate the effect of ACTH on cAMP levels. Similarly, IL-1 beta potentiated IL-6 release stimulated by forskolin and (Bu)2cAMP. Thus, the adrenal may be an important convergence point between the immune and endocrine systems, and because IL-6 release is regulated by IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, ACTH, and angiotensin II, and this cytokine stimulates corticosterone release, IL-6 may play an important paracrine role in integrating the signals derived from these systems.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "A M", "last_name": "Judd", "initials": "AM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Medicine, University of Virginia Health Sciences Center, Charlottesville 22908."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "R M", "last_name": "MacLeod", "initials": "RM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Endocrinology", "issn": ["0013-7227"], "volume": "130", "issue": "3", "pub_year": "1992", "pub_month": "Mar", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "1312844", "doi": "10.1016/0006-291x(92)90569-7", "title": "Interaction of interferon-alpha with interleukin-1 beta or tumor necrosis factor-alpha on hepatitis B virus enhancer activity.", "abstract": "The interaction of IFN-alpha with IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha on hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) expression was analysed in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA integrated PLC/PRF/5 and non-integrated HuH-7 human hepatoma cells.

The cytokine is secreted by cells of the anterior pituitary and endocrine pancreas and has recently been shown to be produced by cultures of thyroid epithelial cells. In this study we have examined some of the factors which regulate IL-6 release from an immortalized human thyroid line (HTori3). IL-6 release over 24 h was stimulated by TSH (5000 microU/ml), by forskolin (0.01 mmol/l), by fetal calf serum (1-20%) and by epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml). Stimulation was also apparent with gamma-interferon and with tumour necrosis factor at concentrations known to enhance class II major histocompatibility antigen expression by thyroid epithelium. The most potent factor tested was interleukin-1 (IL-1), which controls IL-6 release from other cell types. Threefold stimulation was found with 1 U/ml rising to 350-fold with 1000 U/ml. The effect of IL-1 took 2 h to develop and was blocked by cycloheximide (100 mumol/l). Stimulation was not markedly inhibited by pertussis toxin. Many of the actions of IL-1 are mediated by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). At concentrations as low as 30 nmol/l, PGE2 stimulated IL-6 release but the maximum stimulation obtained with PGE2 was only threefold. The effect of IL-1 was not inhibited by indomethacin. These data provide further evidence that IL-6 is produced by human thyrocytes. The effect of IL-1 has not been demonstrated previously.

Thus, physiological and pharmacological concentrations of hydrocortisone had dramatic inhibitory effects on the supernatant levels of TNF and IL-1, and on the number of available TNF, IL-1 and IL-6 transcripts in PEC exposed to LPS, but had minimal effects on supernatant levels of IL-6 bioactivity.

The addition of IL-4 to cells cultured under basal conditions caused a dose-dependent suppression in the release of 92-kD type IV collagenase without affecting TIMP production. 92-kD enzyme secretion was inhibited by 50% with 1-2 ng/ml of IL-4 and by 90% with 10 ng/ml of IL-4.

Metabolic labeling experiments and Northern hybridizations demonstrated that IL-4 exerted its action at a pretranslational level. Furthermore, IL-4 possessed the capacity to inhibit metalloproteinase expression even in the relatively immature peripheral blood monocyte. As reported previously (Shapiro, S. D., E. J. Campbell, D.

Nanomolar concentrations of LTB4 were optimal and the LTB4 receptor antagonist LY 255283 could block its activity.

Gelatinase B (96 kDa), a matrix metalloproteinase inducible by IL-1 beta, was dose-dependently regulated in the parental C127 cell line and in the weakly transformed cell line Tlc. These data suggest that transformation processes by BPV1 generally impair IL-1-regulated gene transcription. This impairment seems not to be located at the IL-1 beta receptor level, since in all the cell lines studied the numbers and affinities of the IL-1 beta binding sites were found to be comparable. This impairment seems not to be mediated by transformation-induced inactivation of the protein kinase C pathway since phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induced IL-6 production equally well in all C127 cell-derived clones. It is suggested that BPV1 transformation can change the expression of host genes that might play a functional role in tumor immune surveillance and tumorigenicity in vivo.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "A", "last_name": "Fuse", "initials": "A", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Rega Institute for Medical Research, University of Leuven, Belgium."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "B", "last_name": "Simizu", "initials": "B", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Van Ranst", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "G", "last_name": "Opdenakker", "initials": "G", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J", "last_name": "Van Damme", "initials": "J", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Lymphokine and cytokine research", "issn": ["1056-5477"], "volume": "11", "issue": "4", "pub_year": "1992", "pub_month": "Aug", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "1330702", "doi": "10.1016/0014-5793(92)81431-k", "title": "Synthesis of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in human hepatoma cells (HepG2).

Dibutyryl cAMP, 8-Br-cAMP and two adenylate cyclase-activating reagents, cholera toxin (CT) and forskolin (FK), all exhibited the similar augmenting effects as IL-1. These reagents augmented M1 cell differentiation by IL-6, and they did not induce differentiation in combination with IL-1. cAMP derivatives, CT, FK, IL-1 and IL-6 all inhibited the proliferation of M1 cells.

Lipopolysaccharide, which is a known stimulus for interleukin-1 transcription in several cell types, also induced interleukin-1 mRNA accumulation, thus indicating that lipopolysaccharide mediates interleukin-1 gene activation in human mesangial cells through an interleukin-1-independent pathway.

We have previously shown that IL-4 reduces steady state messenger RNA (mRNA) levels for IL-1 beta in human monocytes by decreasing both IL-1 beta transcription and the t1/2 of newly formed IL-1 beta mRNA transcripts. In the present study, we extend these findings to show that IL-4 similarly accelerates the turnover of IL-6 mRNA in LPS-stimulated monocytes. However, this inhibition of cytokine expression and dramatic increase in the decay rate of cytokine mRNA does not extend to all LPS-inducible genes because IL-4 treatment did not inhibit the expression or accelerate the turnover of mRNA for the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) in the same cells. Although IL-1 beta and IL-1Ra are both LPS-inducible genes, they displayed distinct temporal patterns of expression. Peak steady state mRNA levels for IL-1ra lagged significantly behind that of IL-1 beta, suggesting a possible endogenous mechanism for limiting IL-1 biologic activity. Furthermore, although IL-4 suppressed expression of both IL-1 beta and IL-6, it up-regulated synthesis of IL-1ra mRNA and protein.

Because glomerular mesangial cells (MC) secrete M-CSF, we investigated whether cultured MRL-lpr MC secrete more M-CSF than C3H MC. Paradoxically, unstimulated MRL-lpr MC secreted substantially less M-CSF than C3H MC [26 +/- 11 vs. 109 +/- 7 colony forming units (CFU)].

Fewer MRL-lpr MC than C3H MC (24 +/- 5% vs. 78 +/- 5%) expressed membrane M-CSF. Furthermore, the increase in the mean channel log fluorescence intensity on MRL-lpr MC was considerably less than in C3H MC, indicating a lower density of M-CSF on MRL-lpr MC. Because our prior studies established that MRL-lpr kidneys have enhanced expression of TNF alpha, we stimulated cultured MC with TNF alpha. TNF alpha increased M-CSF secretion by stimulated MRL-lpr by twofold over unstimulated MRL-lpr MC, but did not increase M-CSF in C3H MC.

In order to study it, some combinations of expression vectors NF-IL6 cDNA, NF-kappa B (p50/p65) cDNA and reporter plasmid K18-CAT which contains human IL-6 promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, were transfected into Jurkat cells and the CAT activities were examined.

Then, co-transfection of NF-IL6 and NF-kappa B subunit p65 alone showed a high level of CAT activity, too. When 5' deletion mutant reporter plasmid K9-CAT lacking the NF-IL6 binding site was used, co-transfection of NF-IL6 and NF-kappa B (p50/p65) showed low level of CAT activity. These results indicate that there is a synergistic effect between NF-IL6 and NF-kappa B (p50/p65) in IL-6 gene regulation. Among two subunits of NF-kappa B (p50/p65), p65 seems to play an important role rather than p50 does in synergism between NF-IL6 and NF-kappa B.

In initial mixing experiments HIV AM supernatants enhanced mitogen-induced T cell proliferation using normal AM as AC significantly more than normal AM supernatants, suggesting that HIV AM secreted more T cell stimulatory factors than normal AM. Neither group could enhance T cell proliferation induced by HIV AM suggesting these cells already secreted optimal levels of these factors. AM from HIV+ individuals produced and secreted more IL-1 beta (measured by ELISA) and IL-6 (measured in a B9 bioassay and by immunoprecipitation) than normal AM both spontaneously and in the presence of low LPS concentrations and mitogens. In some cases depleting HIV AM supernatants of IL-1 beta and IL-6 on immunoaffinity columns abrogated their enhancement properties indicating that these cytokines were important in the observed enhancement.

Actinomycin D chase experiments suggested that enhanced stability of preproendothelin-1 mRNA could not account for the increase in ET-1 transcript levels. TNF-alpha increased ET-1 release and preproendothelin-1 mRNA content in bovine renal artery and bovine glomerular capillary endothelial cells, demonstrating that the TNF-alpha effect was evident in endothelial cells derived from a variety of sources. Furthermore, augmented ET-1 expression in response to TNF-alpha was evident in bovine glomerular mesangial cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "P A", "last_name": "Marsden", "initials": "PA", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Medicine, St. Michael's Hospital, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "B M", "last_name": "Brenner", "initials": "BM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "The American journal of physiology", "issn": ["0002-9513"], "volume": "262", "issue": "4 Pt 1", "pub_year": "1992", "pub_month": "Apr", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "1576016", "doi": "10.1016/8756-3282(92)90010-t", "title": "Effect of calcitriol on the secretion of prostaglandin E2, interleukin 1, and tumor necrosis factor alpha by human monocytes.", "abstract": "Cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage express specific receptors for calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) and secrete prostaglandins and several cytokines with potent effects on bone metabolism. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of calcitriol on the secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF alpha). Monocyte-enriched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy subjects were cultured in the presence or absence of calcitriol (10(-11)-10(-7) M) and several stimulating agents. After 24 h, PGE2, IL-1, and TNF alpha were measured in the culture supernatants or lysates with specific immunoassays. Calcitriol induced a biphasic effect on PGE2 production by unstimulated cells and increased PGE2 synthesis by cells stimulated with either endotoxin or tau-interferon (IFN-tau). On the other hand, calcitriol inhibited the production of TNF alpha by monocytes stimulated with either IFN-tau or phorbol esters. This effect was not prevented by the addition of indomethacin, IL-1, or IL-2. Under the conditions used, we observed no effect of calcitriol on IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta production. These results indicate that calcitriol induces in vitro marked changes in the secretion of monocyte products with known activity on bone cells.

By using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we found that approximately 2 to 10 ng/ml of IL-6 was secreted by cultured H-RS cells (10(6) cells/ml). In tissues, we were able to immunolocalize IL-6 in the cytoplasm in 10 to 30% of H-RS cells by using rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal anti-IL-6 antibodies. There was no correlation among the IL-6 staining intensity, number of H-RS cells stained, and the degree of plasma cell infiltration. However, in 3 of 17 cases studied, a large number (60%) of H-RS cells were positive for IL-6, and in these patients, abundant plasma cells were present. In one patient, the involved lymph node also showed histologic features similar to those of Castleman's disease. In this patient, we noted abundant IL-6 expression not only in H-RS cells, but also in most reactive histiocytes.

We also conducted studies with specific anti-IL-4 antibodies, which did not show IL-4 production by H-RS cells in both cultures and tissues. In tissues, only rare IL-4 positive lymphoid cells or dendritic cells were identified.

The rate of release of PGs [PGE2, PGF2 alpha, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (6KPGF1 alpha) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) in the medium was found to stabilize after 60 min of preincubation and thereafter remain constant, with TXB2 being the predominant species. Twenty-minute incubation in the presence of human recombinant IL-1 beta or IL-6, in the dose range 1-100 U/ml, had no effect on the release of PGF2 alpha, 6KPGF1 alpha or TXB2; however, the release of PGE2 was significantly increased by both IL-1 beta and IL-6. The effect of IL-1 beta was antagonized by both indomethacin and dexamethasone. None of the other neurotransmitters tested had any effect on the release of any of the PGs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "P", "last_name": "Navarra", "initials": "P", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Pharmacology, Catholic University Medical School, Rome, Italy."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "G", "last_name": "Pozzoli", "initials": "G", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "L", "last_name": "Brunetti", "initials": "L", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "E", "last_name": "Ragazzoni", "initials": "E", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Besser", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A", "last_name": "Grossman", "initials": "A", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Neuroendocrinology", "issn": ["0028-3835"], "volume": "56", "issue": "1", "pub_year": "1992", "pub_month": "Jul", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "1648713", "doi": "10.1016/0196-9781(91)90015-h", "title": "Neuropeptide alpha-MSH antagonizes IL-6- and TNF-induced fever.", "abstract": "The pro-opiomelanocortin-derived peptide melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) antagonizes the fever induced by several stimuli including endotoxin, endogenous pyrogen, and certain cytokines.

The possibility that wild-type (wt) p53, a nuclear tumor-suppressor protein, but not its transforming mutants might serve to repress IL-6 gene expression was investigated in HeLa cells. We transiently cotransfected these cells with constitutive cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer/promoter expression plasmids overproducing wt or mutant human or murine p53 and with appropriate chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmids containing the promoter elements of human IL-6, c-fos, or beta-actin genes or of porcine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene in pN-38 to evaluate the effect of the various p53 species on these promoters. Murine and human wt p53 derived from pCMVNc9 and pC53-SN3, respectively, strongly repressed the IL-6 (promoter position -225 to +13), c-fos (-711 to +42), beta-actin (-3400 to +912), and MHC (-528 to -38) promoters in serum-induced HeLa cells; additionally, IL-6 promoter/CAT transcription unit constructs induced by IL-1, phorbol ester, or pseudorabies virus were also repressed by wt human and murine p53.

We were interested in whether other hypothalamic neuropeptides, which activate adenylate cyclase in the pituitary, also stimulate pituitary IL-6 production. Whereas vasoactive intestinal peptide was effective in stimulating pituitary IL-6 production only at concentrations of 10(-6) M or higher, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide with 38 residues (PACAP38) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) at concentrations from 10(-10) to 10(-9) M significantly stimulated IL-6 production. Similar effective concentrations of each peptide were required for activating adenylate cyclase, as measured by extracellular cAMP accumulation. H89, a specific inhibitor of cAMP dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A), inhibited IL-6 production stimulated by PACAP38, CGRP, and (Bu)2cAMP. However, H89 failed to inhibit the IL-6 production stimulated by lipopolysaccharide, a ligand which enhanced IL-6 production in the absence of cAMP accumulation. Two other peptides which are known to activate pituitary adenylate cyclase, corticotropin-releasing factor and GRF failed to stimulate IL-6 production in pituitary cells. Using discontinuous Percoll gradients to fractionate the pituitary cells, the greatest PACAP38-stimulated IL-6 secretion was observed in the low density fraction 1 (F1). This fraction also contained the highest percentage of folliculo-stellate (FS) cells, one of the nonhormone secreting pituitary cells. However, the largest PACAP38-induced accumulation of cAMP was observed in F4. These results suggest that the production of IL-6 stimulated by PACAP and CGRP is mediated by the adenylate cyclase/protein kinase A signal transduction system.

In the present study, we have examined whether the TNF-alpha-induced synthesis of IL-6 or collagenase in HOME cells is mediated by an inducible growth factor. Among several growth factors examined, we found that the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) mRNA was the one most prominently enhanced when HOME cells were treated with TNF-alpha. The increase of bFGF mRNA by TNF-alpha in HOME cells was observed in both a dose- and time-dependent manner when assayed by Northern blot analysis. The induction of bFGF mRNA was observed by 3 h after incubation with TNF-alpha, and the maximal increase of 5-fold was obtained after 12 h of incubation with 100 units/ml TNF-alpha. Western blot analysis confirmed the enhanced synthesis of bFGF by TNF-alpha. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation assays of bFGF showed that exposure to TNF-alpha enhanced secretion of bFGF into culture medium and also that TNF-alpha stimulated the production of bFGF molecules with molecular masses of 18, 21, and 22.5 kDa in HOME cells. TNF-alpha induced the expression of collagenase mRNA and IL-6 mRNA in HOME cells as well, and the coadministration of neutralizing anti-bFGF antibody almost completely blocked the effects of TNF-alpha. The treatment of HOME cells with exogenous bFGF significantly stimulated the expression of collagenase mRNA and IL-6 mRNA in HOME cells.

One major pathway by which TNF receptors communicate signals from the membrane to the cell nucleus involves protein kinase C (PKC). In the present study, we have addressed the molecular mechanism of TNF-induced PKC activation. To this, membrane lipids of the human histiocytic cell line U937 were labeled by incubation with various radioactive precursors, and TNF-induced changes in phospholipid, neutral lipid, and water-soluble metabolites were analyzed by thin layer chromatography. TNF treatment of U937 cells resulted in a rapid and transient increase of 1'2'diacylglycerol (DAG), a well-known activator of PKC. The increase in DAG was detectable as early as 15 s after TNF treatment and peaked at 60 s. DAG increments were most pronounced (approximately 360% of basal levels) when cells were preincubated with [14C]lysophosphatidylcholine, which was predominantly incorporated into the phosphatidylcholine (PC) pool of the plasma-membranes. Further extensive examination of changes in metabolically labeled phospholipids indicated that TNF-stimulated hydrolysis of PC is accompanied by the generation of phosphorylcholine and DAG. These results suggest the operation of a PC-specific phospholipase C. Since no changes in phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline were observed and the production of DAG by TNF could not be blocked by either propranolol or ethanol, a combined activation of phospholipase D and PA-phosphohydrolase in DAG production appears unlikely. TNF-stimulated DAG production as well as PKC activation could be blocked by the phospholipase inhibitor p-bromophenacylbromide (BPB). Since BPB did not inactivate PKC directly, these findings underscore that TNF activates PKC via formation of DAG. TNF stimulation of DAG production could be inhibited by preincubation of cells with a monoclonal anti-TNF receptor (p55-60) antibody, indicating that activation of a PC-specific phospholipase C is a TNF receptor-mediated event.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "S", "last_name": "Sch\u00fctze", "initials": "S", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Institut f\u00fcr Medizinische Mikrobiologie und Hygiene, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "D", "last_name": "Berkovic", "initials": "D", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "O", "last_name": "Tomsing", "initials": "O", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "C", "last_name": "Unger", "initials": "C", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Kr\u00f6nke", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "The Journal of experimental medicine", "issn": ["0022-1007"], "volume": "174", "issue": "5", "pub_year": "1991", "pub_month": "Nov", "pub_day": "01"}}, {"pmid": "1659519", "doi": "10.1210/endo-129-6-2933", "title": "Tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibits gonadotropin action in cultured porcine Leydig cells: site(s) of action.", "abstract": "In the present study, we have tested the direct effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on basal and human (h)CG-stimulated testosterone secretion by cultured purified Leydig cells isolated from immature porcine testes. TNF-alpha reduced (as much as 90% decrease) hCG-stimulated, but not basal testosterone secretion in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The maximal and half-maximal effects were, respectively, 3.75 ng/ml (2.2 x 10(-10) M) and 0.66 ng/ml (3.9 x 10(-11) M) of TNF-alpha after 48 h treatment. TNF-alpha antagonizes the gonadotropin hormonal action by affecting at least two types of biochemical steps. First, TNF-alpha reduced LH/hCG binding to a maximal decrease of 45% obtained with 2 ng/ml of TNF-alpha after 48 h of treatment. TNF-alpha also inhibited (44% decrease) hCG-stimulated cAMP production in optimal conditions (20 ng/ml, 72 h). Second, TNF-alpha significantly (P less than 0.001) reduced testosterone secretion stimulated with 8-bromo-cAMP (3 x 10(-3) M) in a similar range (86% decrease) to that observed with the gonadotropin. Such an observation indicates that the antigonadotropic action of the cytokine is exerted in a predominant manner at a step(s) located beyond cAMP formation. Furthermore, incubation of Leydig cells with 22R-hydroxycholesterol (5 micrograms/ml, 2 h) reversed most of the inhibitory effect of TNF-alpha on androgen production. Indeed, the TNF-alpha (20 ng/ml, 72 h) inhibitory effect on testosterone production was limited to about 20% (P less than 0.03) in Leydig cells supplied with 22R-hydroxycholesterol. Such a moderate effect of the cytokine in the presence of 22R-hydroxycholesterol compared with that observed when androgen secretion was stimulated with the gonadotropin (up to 90% inhibition) indicate that TNF-alpha acts by dramatically reducing cholesterol substrate availability in the mitochondria. Such an effect of TNF-alpha is directly exerted on Leydig cells since TNF-alpha receptors (dissociation constant approximately 5.4 x 10(-10) M) are present in primary cultures of purified porcine Leydig cells. Together, the present findings show that in Leydig cells TNF-alpha antagonizes the gonadotropin action on testosterone formation predominantly through a decrease in the availability of cholesterol substrate in the mitochondria.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "C", "last_name": "Mauduit", "initials": "C", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["INSERM CJF No. 90-08, Groupe de Recherches sur les Communications Cellulaires, H\u00f4pital Sainte Eug\u00e9nie, Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Pierre-B\u00e9nite, France."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "D J", "last_name": "Hartmann", "initials": "DJ", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M A", "last_name": "Chauvin", "initials": "MA", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A", "last_name": "Revol", "initials": "A", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "A M", "last_name": "Morera", "initials": "AM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Benahmed", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Endocrinology", "issn": ["0013-7227"], "volume": "129", "issue": "6", "pub_year": "1991", "pub_month": "Dec", "pub_day": null}}, {"pmid": "1663147", "doi": "10.1007/BF01133023", "title": "Effects of sex steroids on immunoglobulin M production by Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell line SKW6-CL4.", "abstract": "The effects of estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), and testosterone (T) on the production of immunoglobulin (Ig) M by Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell line, SKW6-CL4, were investigated.

In this study we have investigated the ability of PMN to secrete interleukin-6 (IL-6), a molecule known to be involved in inflammatory reactions.

Northern blot analysis with total cellular RNA from mixed populations of PBMC revealed that genes coding for TNF and LT were not spontaneously expressed. Treatment of PBMC with recombinant interleukin (IL)-2 resulted in a high level expression of TNF and LT mRNA. Whereas IL-1 beta was equally effective as IL-2 in inducing both TNF and LT mRNA, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor selectively induced only TNF mRNA. Both TNF and LT mRNA were minimally induced by IL-1 alpha, IL-3, interferon (IFN)-alpha, or IFN-gamma. Similarly TNF alone had little effect on induction of TNF and LT mRNA. In conjunction with IL-2, cytokines such as IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, or TNF did not interfere with IL-2 induction of TNF and LT mRNA. Interestingly, IL-4 in combination with IL-2 inhibited the IL-2-driven induction of TNF and LT mRNA. This inhibitory effect of IL-4 was also observed at the level of TNF and LT protein secretion. Furthermore, IL-4 was also inhibitory of IL-2-mediated induction of Tac mRNA in PBMC. These results extend the interrelationship of cytokine regulation of TNF and LT expression.

Monoclonal antibodies to CR2 immunoprecipitated from digitonin lysates of Raji B lymphoblastoid cells a membrane complex containing CR2, approximately equimolar amounts of CD19, which is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and three unidentified components: p130, p50, and p20. The complex, which was immunoprecipitated also with anti-CD19, could be dissociated by Nonidet P-40, accounting for its absence in previous studies of CR2. Expression of recombinant CR2 and CD19 in K562 erythroleukemia cells led to formation of a complex that contained not only these two proteins but also p130, p50, and p20, and another component, p14. These unidentified components of the CR2/CD19 complex coimmunoprecipitated with CD19 and not with CR2 from singly transfected cells, indicating primary association with the former. CD19 replicated the capacity of CR2 to interact synergistically with mIgM for increasing free intracellular Ca2+, suggesting that the complex mediates this function of CR2. Therefore, CR2 associates directly with CD19 to become a ligand-binding subunit of a pre-existing signal transduction complex of the B cell that may be representative of a family of membrane protein complexes.

This was followed by the highly selective induction of two primary response genes, junB/AP-1 transcription factor and TIS11. junB and TIS11 inductions were unaffected by cycloheximide, suggesting that posttranslational modifications accounted for their activation. Activation of junB and TIS11 transcription required rapid tyrosine kinase activity as well as a different protein kinase activity sensitive to the potent kinase inhibitor, H7, and activated following p160 tyrosine phosphorylation.

To explain the mechanisms for this difference, we compared the regulation of these two genes in human T lymphocytes, isolated from peripheral blood, after stimulation with the mitogens concanavalin A and phorbol myristate acetate. Differences in the kinetics of protein secretion were paralleled by differences in cognate mRNA accumulation. TNF mRNA accumulated rapidly after stimulation, peaked by 6 h, and returned to unstimulated (base-line) levels by 24 h. In contrast, LT mRNA accumulated slowly after stimulation, usually peaked at approximately 18 h, and remained increased above base-line levels at 48-72 h. By nuclear transcription run-on assays, increased transcription of TNF mRNA and LT mRNA was demonstrated after stimulation. However, TNF transcription peaked earlier and appeared to be 4-10 times greater than that of the LT gene. In contrast, the half-life of LT mRNA was 8-10-fold longer than that of TNF mRNA as demonstrated by actinomycin D pulse-chase experiments. Cycloheximide did not block LT or TNF mRNA accumulation, indicating that new protein synthesis was not required for induction of either gene. These results suggest strongly that the LT and TNF genes are regulated differently in human T lymphocytes after mitogen stimulation. TNF mRNA accumulates rapidly primarily because of increased transcription and decreases rapidly related to its brief half-life. In contrast, LT mRNA accumulates more slowly but persists much longer; the accumulation of this mRNA appears to be controlled largely by post-transcriptional mechanisms.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "B K", "last_name": "English", "initials": "BK", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seatle."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "W M", "last_name": "Weaver", "initials": "WM", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "C B", "last_name": "Wilson", "initials": "CB", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "issn": ["0021-9258"], "volume": "266", "issue": "11", "pub_year": "1991", "pub_month": "Apr", "pub_day": "15"}}, {"pmid": "1707930", "doi": null, "title": "Effects of cytokine combinations on acute phase protein production in two human hepatoma cell lines.", "abstract": "We evaluated the effects of binary combinations of four cytokines on production of the positive acute phase proteins alpha-1 antichymotrypsin, haptoglobin and fibrinogen, and the negative acute phase proteins albumin and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in two human hepatoma cell lines. The effects of the cytokine combinations on the five proteins varied; each protein exhibited a unique and specific pattern of response to the cytokine combinations. In Hep G2 cells, antichymotrypsin was induced by all four cytokines, IL-6, IL-1, TNF-alpha, and transforming growth factor beta 1 alone, and their effects in binary combinations could be attributed to additive or minimally synergistic interactions. Fibrinogen was induced only by IL-6 and this induction was inhibited by IL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha or transforming growth factor beta 1. Haptoglobin was also induced only by IL-6, but TNF-alpha was the only cytokine that inhibited this induction at all concentrations of IL-6. Each of the four cytokines alone down regulated production of AFP and albumin. However, binary combinations of the four cytokines were simply additive, for the most part, in inhibiting AFP production, whereas the inhibitory effects of combinations of cytokines on albumin production differed significantly from simple additive effects. These observations, taken together with studies of effects of cytokine combinations on other acute phase proteins, indicate that the various acute phase proteins respond differently to different combinations of cytokines and that the potential exists for highly specific regulation of synthesis of individual plasma proteins by cytokine interactions.

In serum free medium, unstimulated human osteoblast-like cells produced IL-6 in the range of 1000-2050 pg/ml/24 h. Recombinant human interleukin 1 (IL-1 alpha) (10(-13)-10(-11) M), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) (10(-9)-10(-7) M) and lipopolysaccharide (5-500 ng/ml) all stimulated release of IL-6 from human bone cells. Maximal levels of 17,000 pg/ml were observed using the highest concentration of IL-1. 1,25(OH)2D3 and PTH did not stimulate IL-6 release. Using a specific sheep antihuman IL-6 antibody, all IL-6 activity could be neutralized. In parallel studies, ROS 17/2.8 rat osteosarcoma cells released around 50 pg/ml of IL-6 under basal conditions which were increased to a maximum of 900 pg/ml by treatment with PTH (10(-9) M). The cytokines were less effective and 1,25(OH)2D3 again had no effect. Modulation of expression of IL-6 mRNA in human osteoblast cells was examined using a human complementary deoxyribonucleic acid probe.

Dexamethasone (10(-6) M) suppressed both basal and IL-1- and TNF-induced IL-6 mRNA expression. IL-6 receptor mRNA was constitutively expressed but was not regulated by any of the above agents.

We applied a McCoy cell culture system to study the effects of various concentrations of beta-estradiol (10(-6) to 10(-10) M) on T. vaginalis growth and CDF production. T. vaginalis growth was unaffected by the different concentrations of beta-estradiol studied, in comparison with the growth of control cultures without beta-estradiol.

The decrease in thrombomodulin mRNA resulted from inhibition of transcription, followed by rapid degradation of thrombomodulin transcripts (t1/2 less than or equal to 3 hours). In pulse-chase incubations, thrombomodulin synthesis decreased parallel with mRNA, but the rate of degradation of radiolabeled thrombomodulin was not significantly altered by TNF. Human thrombomodulin was degraded with a t1/2 of 8.2 +/- 2.4 hours (SD) or 7.5 +/- 1.3 hours (SD) in the absence or presence of TNF, respectively. We conclude that TNF acts primarily to inhibit thrombomodulin transcription. The subsequent decrease in activity results from the inherent instability of thrombomodulin mRNA and protein in these cells, and not from the regulation of thrombomodulin degradation.", "author_list": [{"fore_name": "S R", "last_name": "Lentz", "initials": "SR", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": ["Department of Medicine, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110."], "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "M", "last_name": "Tsiang", "initials": "M", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}, {"fore_name": "J E", "last_name": "Sadler", "initials": "JE", "collective_name": null, "orcid": null, "affiliations": null, "emails": null}], "journal": {"title": "Blood", "issn": ["0006-4971"], "volume": "77", "issue": "3", "pub_year": "1991", "pub_month": "Feb", "pub_day": "01"}}]
